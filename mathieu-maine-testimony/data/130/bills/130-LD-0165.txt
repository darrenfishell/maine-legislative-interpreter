9 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
10Sec. 2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State 
11 shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the name

13 and the date when payable.
14Sec. 3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of State 
15 may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be 
16 loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
17 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
18 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
19 forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the projects 
20 in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
21 general obligation bonds.

23 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Act and all sums coming due for payment 
24 of bonds at maturity.

26 expended as set out in this Act under the direction and supervision of the Department of 
27 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Parks and Lands for deferred 
28 maintenance and infrastructure enhancements of state parks and historic sites in accordance 
29 with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, chapter 220, including all costs associated with 
30 such maintenance and enhancements, except that use of the proceeds of these bonds is 
31 subject to the following conditions and requirements.  To the extent the purposes are 
32 consistent with the disbursement provisions in this Act, 100% of the bond proceeds may 
33 be considered as state match for any federal funding to be made available to the State.
34Sec. 6.  Disbursement of bond proceeds from General Fund bond issue.  The 
35 proceeds of the sale of the bonds authorized under this Act must be expended as designated
