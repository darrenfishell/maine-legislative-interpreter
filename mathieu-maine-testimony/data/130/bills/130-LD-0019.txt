2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Legislature established the Maine Education Savings Program, also 
4 known as NextGen 529, as Maine's Section 529 plan, so-called after Section 529 of the 
5 federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to be administered by the Finance Authority of 
6 Maine; and
7Whereas, the Maine Education Savings Program provides account owners and 
8 beneficiaries the opportunity to realize potential tax advantages if assets are used for 
9 qualified higher education expenses; and
10Whereas, the United States Congress has recently expanded the federal definition of 
11 "qualified higher education expenses" to include certain expenses related to registered and 
12 certified apprenticeship programs and limited repayments of qualified education loans; and
13Whereas, under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, section 11483, the Finance 
14 Authority of Maine is authorized to take necessary action to ensure that the Maine 
15 Education Savings Program complies with federal law, and the authority considers it 
16 prudent to make statutory changes to conform with the expanded federal definition and to 
17 make certain other amendments to the law; and
18Whereas, in order to avoid confusion in the application and use of the Maine 
19 Education Savings Program, it is necessary that these conforming changes take effect as 
20 soon as possible; and
