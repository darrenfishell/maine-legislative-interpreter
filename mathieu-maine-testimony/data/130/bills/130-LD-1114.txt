Page 1 - 130LR0993(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §5806, sub-§2, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, c. 497, 
3 §1, is amended to read:
42.  Maximum allowable tuition.  The maximum allowable tuition charged to a school 
5 administrative unit by a private school is the rate established under subsection 1 or the state 
6 average per public secondary student cost as adjusted, whichever is lower, plus an insured 
7 value factor.  The insured value factor is computed by dividing 5% of the insured value of 
8 school buildings and equipment by the average number of pupils enrolled in the school on 
9 October 1st and April 1st of the year immediately before the school year for which the 
10 tuition charge is computed.  From school year 2009-2010 to school year 2013-2014, a 
11 school administrative unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than 5% of 
12 the school's tuition rate or $500 per student, whichever is less, unless the legislative body 
13 of the school administrative unit votes to authorize its school board to pay a higher insured 
14 value factor that is no greater than 10% of the school’s tuition rate per student.  For the 
15 2014-2015 school year, a school administrative unit is not required to pay an insured value 
16 factor greater than 6% of the school's tuition rate per student, unless the legislative body of 
17 the school administrative unit votes to authorize its school board to pay a higher insured 
18 value factor that is no greater than 10% of the school's tuition rate per student.  Beginning 
19 in the 2015-2016 school year, a school administrative unit is not required to pay an insured 
20 value factor greater than the amount of the prior school year's insured value factor adjusted 
21 by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the state share percentage of the total 
22 cost of funding public education in the prior school year as determined by section 15671, 
23 subsection 7, paragraph C B as compared to the applicable percentage for the current school 
24 year.  In no case may the insured value factor be less than 6% or greater than 10% of the 
25 school's tuition rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative 
26 unit votes to authorize its school board to pay an insured value factor that exceeds the 
27 amount otherwise permitted by this subsection by no more than 5% of the school's tuition 
28 rate per student.  For the 2013-2014 school year only, the maximum allowable tuition 
29 charged to a school administrative unit by a private school that participates in the Maine 
30 Public Employees Retirement System must be increased above the amount otherwise 
31 permitted under this section by an amount equal to the calculated normal cost of teacher 
32 retirement for that school divided by the number of enrolled students as of October 1, 2012.
33Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §15671, sub-§7, ¶B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 616, Pt. C, 
34 §1, is amended by enacting a new subparagraph (17) to read:
35 (17)  For fiscal year 2021-22, the target is 55%.
36Sec. 3.  20-A MRSA §15671, sub-§7, ¶C, as amended by PL 2019, c. 616, Pt. C, 
37 §2, is repealed.
38SUMMARY
