Page 1 - 130LR2318(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §4004, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
34. Staffing.  The department shall ensure that a caseworker does not exceed the 
4 maximum workload and work and driving hours established pursuant to this subsection.
5 A. The department may not require a caseworker to work more than:
6 (1) Sixty hours over 7 consecutive days; or
7 (2) Seventy hours over 8 consecutive days.
8 B. The department may require a caseworker to work for up to 14 hours following 10 
9 consecutive hours of not working, but the department may not require a caseworker to 
10 drive for more than 11 hours during that shift.
11 C. The department shall require a caseworker to maintain a driving log for the time the 
12 caseworker is working.
13 D.  The department shall establish a maximum workload for a caseworker by 
14 considering factors that influence the amount of time a caseworker can adequately 
15 focus on each case, including, but not limited to, whether a family has multiple 
16 children, the level of interaction needed with parents and family members, the child’s 
17 placement, the number and geographic spread of rural cases and driving requirements.
18Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §4004, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
195. Reporting.  The department shall report on caseworker workloads and work hours 
20 in accordance with this subsection.
21 A. Whenever the maximum workload established by the department pursuant to 
22 subsection 4, paragraph D is exceeded by a caseworker, the department shall report to 
23 the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and 
24 human services matters and the ombudsman under section 4087-A.
25 B. No later than October 1, 2022, the department shall submit an initial report with its 
26 findings and recommendations on staffing, case load and workload in the department’s 
27 Office of Child and Family Services in relation to the maximum workload established 
28 pursuant to subsection 4, paragraph D and shall submit subsequent annual reports by 
29 January 31st of each year beginning in 2023 to the joint standing committee of the 
30 Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters.  Information 
31 reported pursuant to this paragraph must include staffing, case load and workload 
32 levels at both the county and the district office levels.
33Sec. 3. Resolve 2019, c. 34 is repealed. 
34SUMMARY
35 This bill requires that the Department of Health and Human Services ensure that a 
36 caseworker in the department's Office of Child and Family Services does not work or drive 
37 more than a maximum number of hours in a certain period.  It repeals Resolve 2019, chapter 
38 34, which required the department to develop a standard case load recommendation with 
39 the Public Consulting Group and instead requires that the department establish a maximum 
40 workload for caseworkers by considering a variety of factors to ensure that caseworkers 35

Page 2 - 130LR2318(01)41 can adequately focus on each case.  The bill requires the department to report to the joint 
42 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services 
43 matters and the child welfare ombudsman whenever a caseworker’s workload exceeds the 
44 maximum workload.  Resolve 2019, chapter 34 directed the department to report annually 
45 until 2030 on its standard case load recommendations; this bill instead requires the 
46 department to report annually to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
47 jurisdiction over health and human services matters on the staffing, case load and workload 
48 assignments of caseworkers by county and district office.1
