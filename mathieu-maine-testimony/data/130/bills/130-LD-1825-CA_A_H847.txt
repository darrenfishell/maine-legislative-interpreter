1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the majority report of the committee and replaces the bill. The 
3 amendment removes the provisions of the bill that require a caseworker to maintain a 
4 driving log and that establish a maximum workload for caseworkers. It also removes the 
5 provision of the bill that requires reporting to the joint standing committee of the 
6 Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters and the child 
7 welfare services ombudsman when a caseworker exceeds the maximum workload. It also 
8 removes the provision that repeals Resolve 2019, chapter 34. The amendment retains the 
9 provision of the bill that establishes limits on work hours and driving hours. The 
10 amendment adds the ability for a caseworker's supervisor, in consultation with the 
11 Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the commissioner's designee, to direct a 
12 caseworker to exceed the maximum number of work hours for an emergency situation 
13 determined in department policy.
