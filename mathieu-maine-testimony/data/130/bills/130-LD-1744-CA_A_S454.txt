This bill changes how revenue from fees collected on registrations to distribute commercial feed in the State is 
distributed between the Animal Welfare Fund (A WF) and the General Fund. Currently, 50% of the fee is credited to 
the A WF and 50% is credited to the General Fund. This bill changes the distribution to 100% credited to the A WF. 
Changing the ratio will eliminate the budgeted General Fund revenue from this source by $425,000 beginning in fiscal 
year 2022-23 and increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the A WF by $558,720 beginning in fiscal year 
2022-23. 
The bill also increases the daily compensation for animal shelters holding animals pending court decisions from $5 to 
$15 for dogs and cats, from $8 to $18 for female cats or dogs with unweaned litters and from $10 to $20 for equines. It 
also increases from $8 to $20 the upper limit of daily compensation for holding livestock animals, excluding equines, 
fowl and rabbits. 
The bill includes allocations of $558,720 beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 to allow expenditure of the additional 
revenue, which will be more than sufficient to cover the higher compensation paid to animal shelters.
