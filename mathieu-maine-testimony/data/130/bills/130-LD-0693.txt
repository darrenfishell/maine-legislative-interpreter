Page 1 - 130LR0654(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation makes permanent the pilot program to provide case 
4 management services to veterans for mental health care established by Resolve 2017, 
5 chapter 24; and
6Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period 
7 to ensure continued case management services are provided without interruption after the 
8 pilot program ends; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12 therefore,
13Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
14Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง1833 is enacted to read:
15ยง1833.  Mental health care services for veterans
161.  Screening.  A hospital licensed under this chapter shall screen all patients presenting 
17 for emergency care at the hospital's emergency department regarding whether or not the 
18 patient has prior service in the military.  This information must be added to the hospital's 
19 patient data management system.
202.  Reporting.  A hospital licensed under this chapter shall compile data regarding the 
21 number of patients who identify as having prior service in the military who reported or 
22 presented a behavioral or mental health emergency when seeking care from the hospital 
23 emergency department, including the number who were admitted or referred for inpatient 
24 treatment for psychiatric care.  The data collected in accordance with this subsection may 
25 not include information that would disclose the identity of the patient.  A hospital licensed 
26 under this chapter shall report the data to the department twice per year, for the period from 
27 January 1st to June 30th and for the period from July 1st to December 31st.  The department 
28 shall establish the date by which the data for each period must be reported.
293.  Waiver.  The department may grant a waiver of the screening and data collection 
30 requirements under subsections 1 and 2 to a hospital that demonstrates that the 
31 requirements constitute an excessive burden that will substantially affect the operation of 
32 the hospital.  The department may not grant a waiver under this subsection to more than 4 
33 hospitals.
344.  Certain hospitals.  If a report submitted to the department pursuant to Resolve 
35 2017, chapter 24, Part A, section 2 or pursuant to subsection 2 shows that a hospital 
36 identifies 95% or more of the patients who presented for emergency care as having prior 
37 service in the military by the fact that they are enrolled and receive health care benefits 
38 from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the hospital is no longer required 
39 to screen patients and collect data as required by this section.
405.  Annual department report.  The department shall work with the Department of 
41 Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine Bureau of Veterans' Services to 
42 analyze the data submitted by hospitals in accordance with subsection 2 to quantify the 
Page 2 - 130LR0654(01)43 unmet need for mental health care services, particularly inpatient mental health care 
44 services, and to identify gaps in mental health care services provided by the United States 
45 Department of Veterans Affairs.  The department and the bureau shall submit a report on 
46 the analysis to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
47 veterans affairs no later than February 1st annually.
66.  Costs mitigated.  The department shall distribute an annual stipend from the 
7 Veterans Mental Health Case Management and Services Fund under Title 34-B, section 
8 3912 to each hospital that screened for military service and collected data in accordance 
9 with subsections 1 and 2.  The department shall adopt routine technical rules in accordance 
10 with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A to set the amount of the annual stipend.
