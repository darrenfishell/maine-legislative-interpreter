6 owned institution organized under the laws of this State without prior compliance with 
7 section 344 and all rules adopted under that section.  In accordance with section 1054, 
8 subsection 3, paragraph B, a mutual holding company may acquire a state or federal mutual 
9 financial institution through merger into a subsidiary universal bank or an interim 
10 subsidiary universal bank of the mutual holding company without prior compliance with 
11 section 344 and all rules adopted under that section.
12Sec. 2.  9-B MRSA §427, sub-§13-A, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 1, §2 and affected 
13 by §5, is amended to read:
1413-A.  Notice on opening certain accounts.  A signature card or other document 
15 establishing a multiple-party account, as defined in Title 18‑C, section 6‑201, must contain 
16 a clear and conspicuous printed notice to the depositor that on the depositor's death the 
17 balance in the account will belong to the surviving party.  At the time a multiple-party 
18 account, as defined in Title 18-C, section 6-201, subsection 5, is established or at the time 
19 a single-party account is converted to a multiple-party account with a financial institution, 
20 the document establishing the account or adding another party must include for each party 
21 to the account the question, "Do you intend for the sum remaining upon your death to 
22 belong to the surviving party or parties? Yes or No." The question required by this 
23 subsection must be answered in writing on the form by each party to the account prior to 
24 opening the account.  The answer provided on the form required by this subsection does 
25 not have any effect on any legal presumption or inference available in any civil or criminal 
26 matter.
27Sec. 3.  9-B MRSA §1054, sub-§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2009, c. 228, §15, is 
28 further amended to read:
29 B.  Acquire a state or federal mutual financial institution through merger into a

31 company;
32Sec. 4.  9-B MRSA §1212, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:

36 and hold at least one of its governing board meetings in this State each year.

2 effective date of this subsection, an uninsured bank shall locate its principal office in this 
3 State, have at least one resident of this State on its governing board and hold at least one of

5SUMMARY
6 This bill requires new nondepository trust companies, merchant banks and uninsured 
7 banks organized under the laws of this State to locate their principal offices in this State.  
8 It addresses inconsistent language found in the requirement for a signature card or other 
9 document establishing a multiple-party account.  It authorizes mutual holding companies 
10 organized under the laws of this State to acquire by merger a federal mutual financial 
11 institution or other state mutual financial institution under certain conditions.
