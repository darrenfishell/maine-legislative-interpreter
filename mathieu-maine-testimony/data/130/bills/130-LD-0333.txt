3 amended to read:
4 A.  A licensed health care practitioner who voluntarily, without the expectation or

6 professional services, including services provided through telehealth as defined in Title 
7 24‑A, section 4316, subsection 1, paragraph E  C, within the scope of that health care 
8 practitioner's licensure:
9 (1)  To a nonprofit organization;
10 (2)  To an agency of the State or any political subdivision of the State;
11 (3)  To members or recipients of services of a nonprofit organization or state or 
12 local agency;
13 (4)  To support the State's response to a public health threat as defined in Title 22, 
14 section 801, subsection 10;
15 (5)  To support the State's response to an extreme public health emergency as 
16 defined in Title 22, section 801, subsection 4‑A; or
17 (6)  To support the State's response to a disaster as defined in Title 37‑B, section 
18 703, subsection 2;
19Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 289, §2, is 
20 amended to read:
21 C.  "Telehealth," as it pertains to the delivery of health care services, means the use of 
22 interactive real-time visual and audio or other electronic media for the purpose of 
23 consultation and education concerning and diagnosis, treatment, care management and 
24 self-management of an enrollee's physical and mental health and includes real-time 
25 interaction between the enrollee and the telehealth provider, synchronous encounters, 
26 asynchronous encounters, store and forward transfers and telemonitoring.  "Telehealth" 
27 includes the use of audio-only telephone when no means of interactive real-time visual 
28 and audio or other electronic media are available to the enrollee due to lack of such 
29 electronic media or of adequate broadband access or when the use of other means of 
30 interactive real-time visual and audio or other electronic media is infeasible, 
31 impractical or otherwise not medically advisable, as determined by the provider 
32 providing telehealth services to the enrollee or as determined by another provider with 
33 an existing relationship with the enrollee.  "Telehealth" does not include the use of 
34 audio-only telephone, facsimile machine, e-mail or texting.
35Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§1, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 289, §2, is 
36 repealed.
37Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§2, as corrected by RR 2019, c. 2, Pt. A, §28, is 
38 amended to read:
392.  Parity for telehealth services.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State may 
40 not deny coverage on the basis that the health care service is provided through telehealth if 
41 the health care service would be covered if it were provided through in-person consultation 
42 between an enrollee and a provider.  Coverage for health care services provided through 
Page 2 - 130LR0548(01)43 telehealth must be determined in a manner consistent with coverage for health care services 
44 provided through in-person consultation.  A carrier shall reimburse a provider for the 
45 diagnosis, consultation with or treatment of an enrollee delivered through telehealth 
46 services on the same basis and at least at the rate of reimbursement at which the carrier 
47 reimburses a provider for the provision of the same, or substantially similar, service through 
48 in-person consultation.  If an enrollee is eligible for coverage and the delivery of the health 
49 care service through telehealth is medically appropriate, a carrier may not deny coverage 
50 for telehealth services.  A carrier may not offer a health plan under which any deductible 
51 applied to health care services delivered through telehealth accumulates separately from 
52 the deductible that applies in the aggregate to all services covered under the health plan.  A 
53 carrier may offer a health plan containing a provision for a deductible, copayment or 
54 coinsurance requirement for a health care service provided through telehealth as long as 
55 the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or 
56 coinsurance applicable to a comparable service provided through in-person consultation.  
57 A carrier may not exclude a health care service from coverage solely because such health 
58 care service is provided only through a telehealth encounter, as long as telehealth is 
59 appropriate for the provision of such health care service.
18Sec. 5.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§3, ¶G is enacted to read:
19 G.  The carrier may not place any restriction on the prescribing of medication through 
20 telehealth by a provider whose scope of practice includes prescribing medication that 
21 is more restrictive than any requirement in state and federal law for prescribing 
22 medication through in-person consultation.
23Sec. 6.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 289, §2, is repealed.
24Sec. 7.  24-A MRSA §4316, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 289, §2, is amended 
25 to read:
266.  Utilization review.  This section does not prohibit or limit a carrier from conducting 
27 a utilization review for telehealth services as long as the utilization review is conducted in 
28 the same manner, is applied no more stringently and uses the same clinical review criteria 
29 as a utilization review for an in-person consultation for the same service.
30Sec. 8.  Application.  The requirements of this Act apply to health plans, as defined 
31 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, section 4301-A, subsection 7, executed, 
32 delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after January 1, 
33 2022.  For purposes of this Act, all health plan contracts are deemed to be renewed no later 
34 than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
