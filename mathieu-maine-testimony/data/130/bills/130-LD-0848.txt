2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill would expand high-speed Internet access in rural communities in the State by 
6 creating incentives for companies to expand their services to those communities.  It would 
7 expand the definition of "rural" to include specific levels not included in the federal 
8 definition.  Each level would create more incentives for companies to connect to the most 
9 rural areas of the State.  It would propose 4 tiers for populations under 2,500 people:
10 1.  Rural tier 1:  2,000-2,499;
11 2.  Rural tier 2:  1,500-1,999;
12 3.  Rural tier 3:  1,000-1,499; and
13 4.  Rural tier 4:  fewer than 1,000.
14 Tax breaks would be offered to companies to help offset the costs of expanding to the 
15 rural areas, which would become available once 90% of the citizens of a community are 
16 connected to high-speed Internet service.4
