Page 1 - 130LR0063(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §101-D, sub-§5, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 434, §1 and 
3 affected by §15, is further amended to read:
4 A.  Commit the defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human 
5 Services for placement in an appropriate program for observation, care and treatment 
6 of people with mental illness or persons with intellectual disabilities or autism.  An 
7 appropriate program may be in an institution for the care and treatment of people with 
8 mental illness, an intermediate care facility for persons who have intellectual 
9 disabilities or autism, a crisis stabilization unit, a nursing home, a residential care 
10 facility, an assisted living facility, a hospice, a hospital, an intensive outpatient 
11 treatment program or any program specifically approved by the court.  At the end of 
12 30 days or sooner, and again in the event of recommitment, at the end of 60 days and 
13 180 days, the State Forensic Service or other appropriate office of the Department of 
14 Health and Human Services shall forward a report to the Commissioner of Health and 
15 Human Services relative to the defendant's competence to stand trial and its reasons.  
16 The Commissioner of Health and Human Services shall without delay file the report 
17 with the court having jurisdiction of the case.  The court shall hold a hearing on the 
18 question of the defendant's competence to stand trial and receive all relevant testimony 
19 bearing on the question.  If the State Forensic Service's report or the report of another 
20 appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services to the court states 
21 that the defendant is either now competent or not restorable, the court shall within 30 
22 days hold a hearing.  If the court determines that the defendant is not competent to 
23 stand trial, but there does exist a substantial probability that the defendant will be 
24 competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future, the court shall recommit the 
25 defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services for 
26 placement in an appropriate program for observation, care and treatment of people with 
27 mental illness or persons with intellectual disabilities or autism.  An appropriate 
28 program may be in an institution for the care and treatment of people with mental 
29 illness, an intermediate care facility for persons who have intellectual disabilities or 
30 autism, a crisis stabilization unit, a nursing home, a residential care facility, an assisted 
31 living facility, a hospice, a hospital, an intensive outpatient treatment program or any 
32 program specifically approved by the court.  When a person who has been evaluated 
33 on behalf of the court by the State Forensic Service or other appropriate office of the 
34 Department of Health and Human Services is committed into the custody of the 
35 Commissioner of Health and Human Services under this paragraph, the court shall 
36 order that the State Forensic Service or other appropriate office of the Department of 
37 Health and Human Services share any information that it has collected or generated 
38 with respect to the person with the institution or residential program in which the 
39 person is placed.  If the defendant is charged with an offense under Title 17-A, chapter 
40 9, 11 or 13 or Title 17-A, section 506-A, 802 or 803-A and the court determines that 
41 the defendant is not competent to stand trial and there does not exist a substantial 
42 probability that the defendant can be competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall 
43 dismiss all charges against the defendant and, unless .  Unless the defendant is subject 
44 to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the court may order the Commissioner of 
45 Health and Human Services to commence proceedings pursuant to Title 34-B, chapter 
46 3, subchapter 4.  If the defendant is charged with an offense other than an offense under 
Page 2 - 130LR0063(01)47 Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11 or 13 or Title 17-A, section 506-A, 802 or 803-A and the 
48 court determines that the defendant is not competent to stand trial and there does not 
49 exist a substantial probability that the defendant can be competent in the foreseeable 
50 future, the court shall dismiss all charges against the defendant and, unless the 
51 defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, notify the appropriate 
52 authorities who may institute civil commitment proceedings for the individual  if there 
53 is reasonable cause to believe the defendant poses a likelihood of serious harm due to 
54 mental illness.  If the defendant is not currently placed at an institution for the care and 
55 treatment of people with mental illness, the court shall take steps to effect the initiation 
56 of proceedings pursuant to Title 34-B, chapter 3, subchapter 4, including instructing 
57 law enforcement to assess the need for protective custody pursuant to Title 34-B, 
58 section 3862 if necessary.  If the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of 
59 imprisonment, the court shall order the defendant into execution of that sentence and 
60 the correctional facility to which the defendant must be transported shall execute the 
61 court's order; or
16SUMMARY
17 This bill limits the court's authority to order the Commissioner of Health and Human 
18 Services to commence proceedings pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, 
19 chapter 3, subchapter 4 to situations in which there is a reasonable cause to believe the 
20 defendant poses a likelihood of serious harm due to mental illness.  This bill also expands 
21 the court's authority to order the commencement of such proceedings.1
