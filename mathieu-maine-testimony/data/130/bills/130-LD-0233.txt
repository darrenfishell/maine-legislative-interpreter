Page 1 - 130LR0714(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA ยง1254-A, sub-ยง7, as amended by PL 2005, c. 285, ยง1, is further 
3 amended to read:
47.  Availability of qualification forms.  The names of prospective jurors and the 
5 contents of juror qualification forms are confidential and may not be disclosed except as 
6 provided in this chapter.  The names of prospective jurors and the contents of juror 
7 qualification forms may at the discretion of the court must be made available to the 
8 attorneys and their agents and investigators and the pro se parties at the courthouse for use 
9 in the conduct of voir dire examination.  The court shall also provide this information 
10 electronically to the attorneys and their agents and investigators and the pro se parties at 
11 their request.
12SUMMARY
13 Current law authorizes a court to provide certain individuals access to confidential juror 
14 questionnaires, and the law allows such discretionary access to these questionnaires only 
15 at the courthouse itself.  This bill eliminates the court's discretion and requires the court to 
16 provide access to these questionnaires at the courthouse.  The bill also requires the court to 
17 electronically provide these questionnaires to authorized persons upon their request.  The 
18 bill does not affect the confidentiality of such questionnaires and does not affect the 
19 receivers' obligation to maintain this confidentiality.
