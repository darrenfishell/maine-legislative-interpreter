Page 1 - 130LR0950(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §2305-B, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 110, §2, is 
3 amended to read:
41.  Transmission and distribution utilities; microgrids.  A transmission and 
5 distribution utility or a person that constructs, maintains or operates a new microgrid 
6 approved in accordance with section 3351, subsection 3 may construct and maintain its 
7 lines in, upon, along, over, across or under the roads and streets in any municipality in 
8 which it is authorized to supply electricity, subject to the conditions and restrictions 
9 provided in this chapter and chapter 25.
10Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §2305-B, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 110, §2, is 
11 amended to read:
122.  Persons other than transmission and distribution utilities or person that 
13constructs, maintains or operates new microgrid.  A person other than a transmission 
14 and distribution utility or person that constructs, maintains or operates a new microgrid 
15 approved in accordance with section 3351, subsection 3 may not construct or maintain 
16 electric lines, including poles or other related structures, in, upon, along, over, across or 
17 under a road, street or other public way unless:
18 A.  The person satisfies the requirements of section 2503;
19 B.  The person or the person's contractor hired to construct the line provides to the 
20 applicable licensing authority a performance bond:
21 (1)  In the amount of the value of the line, including poles or other related 
22 structures, to be located in the public way; and
23 (2)  That is enforceable for one year from the date the line is energized;
24 C.  Prior to constructing the line, the person notifies the transmission and distribution 
25 utility in whose service territory the line is proposed to be built of the proposed location 
26 of the line; and
27 D.  If a public utility objects to the line on the basis that it may constitute a duplication 
28 of existing transmission or distribution facilities or may interfere with the adequate and 
29 safe delivery of electricity to others, the commission issues a finding that the line is not 
30 a duplication of existing transmission or distribution facilities and does not interfere 
31 with the adequate and safe delivery of electricity to others.  A finding is not required 
32 under this paragraph unless a public utility has objected in writing to the applicable 
33 licensing authority.
34Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA c. 33-A is enacted to read:
35CHAPTER 33-A
36MICROGRIDS
37§3351.  Microgrids
381.  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
39 following terms have the following meanings.
Page 2 - 130LR0950(01)1 A.  "Distributed energy resources" means small-scale electrical generation sources 
2 located close to where the generated electricity is used, energy storage resources, 
3 energy efficiency resources or demand response resources.
4 B.  "New microgrid" means a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy 
5 resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable 
6 entity with respect to the electric grid and can connect and disconnect from the electric 
7 grid to enable the new microgrid to operate in both electric grid-connected mode and 
8 nongrid-connected mode, referred to in this chapter as "island mode," and that is 
9 constructed after October 1, 2020.
102.  Microgrids, public utility exception.   Notwithstanding section 2102 or any other 
11 provision of this Title to the contrary, a person that constructs, maintains or operates a new 
12 microgrid approved under subsection 3 does not, solely as a result of furnishing service 
13 through that new microgrid to participating consumers, become a public utility and is not 
14 subject to regulation as a public utility under this Title.
153.  Commission approval; requirements.  A person may not construct or operate a 
16 new microgrid without commission approval in accordance with this subsection.
17 A.  The commission shall approve a petition to construct and operate a new microgrid 
18 if the commission finds that operation of the new microgrid is in the public interest and 
19 the new microgrid meets at least the following requirements:
20 (1)  The proposed new microgrid will serve a total load of no more than 25 
21 megawatts;
22 (2)  The proposed new microgrid is located in the service territory of a transmission 
23 and distribution utility with more than 50,000 customers;
24 (3)  The distributed energy resources for the new microgrid meet the applicable 
25 portfolio requirements in section 3210, subsections 3, 3-A, 3-B and 3-C;
26 (4)  The person proposing the new microgrid demonstrates that the person has 
27 secured the financial capacity to operate the proposed new microgrid;
28 (5)  The person proposing the new microgrid demonstrates that the person has 
29 secured the technical capability to operate the proposed new microgrid;
30 (6)  There is a contractual relationship between the proposed new microgrid 
31 operator and consumers within the area to be served by the proposed new 
32 microgrid; and
33 (7)  The proposed new microgrid will not negatively affect the reliability and 
34 security of the electric grid.
35 For the purposes of this paragraph, when determining whether a proposed new 
36 microgrid is in the public interest, the commission shall consider possible ratepayer 
37 effects, whether positive or negative; benefits due to the increased resilience or 
38 reliability of the electric grid; economic development benefits; and any other factors 
39 the commission considers necessary to promote the public interest.
40 B.  As a condition of approval of a new microgrid, the commission shall:
41 (1)  Require that any increase in costs to the electric transmission and distribution 
42 system in the State as a result of the new microgrid must be fully recovered from 
Page 3 - 130LR0950(01)43 the microgrid owner and customers of the microgrid and not passed on to other 
44 electric ratepayers; and
3 (2)  Impose any other terms, conditions or requirements on the construction, 
4 maintenance or operation of the new microgrid as, in its judgment, it considers 
5 necessary, which may include but are not limited to parameters regarding the 
6 ability of the new microgrid to enter island mode, as defined by the commission 
7 by rule, and the operation of the new microgrid in grid-connected mode and island 
8 mode.
94.  Commission oversight; grid protections; consumer protections.  A new 
10 microgrid approved in accordance with subsection 3 is subject to commission oversight to 
11 ensure reliability and security of the electric grid and consumer protections for customers 
12 of the new microgrid.
135.  Services.  Services provided by a new microgrid may include, but are not limited 
14 to:
15 A.  Standby electric service, as defined by the commission by rule, when the new 
16 microgrid is operating in island mode; and
17 B.  Selling electricity as a competitive electricity provider when the new microgrid is 
18 operating in grid-connected mode.
196.  Rulemaking. The commission may adopt rules to implement this section. Rules 
20 adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, 
21 subchapter 2-A.
22Sec. 4.  Report.  The Public Utilities Commission shall submit a report by January 7, 
23 2022 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and 
24 utility matters detailing its activities related to new microgrids as defined in the Maine 
25 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3351, subsection 1, paragraph B, including whether 
26 any new microgrids have been approved under Title 35-A, section 3351.  The report must 
27 also include any recommendations for legislation that may be necessary to clarify or 
28 enhance the law regarding new microgrids.  The committee may report out a bill to the 
29 First Regular Session of the 131st Legislature based on the report.
30Sec. 5.  Precedent established by Public Utilities Commission.  The provisions 
31 of this Act may not be interpreted to modify or nullify the analytical framework and 
32 precedent for analyzing whether an entity is a transmission and distribution utility or a 
33 competitive electricity provider established by the Public Utilities Commission in opinions 
34 and orders issued prior to the effective date of this Act, including, but not limited to, 
35 opinions and orders issued under Docket Number 2000-653, Request for Commission 
36 Investigation Regarding the Plans of Boralex Stratton Energy, Inc. to Provide Electric 
37 Service Directly from Stratton Lumber Company and Docket Number 2011-200, ReEnergy 
38 Rumford, LLC, Request for Advisory Ruling.
39SUMMARY
40 This bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to approve a petition to construct and 
41 operate a new microgrid if the commission finds the proposal to be in the public interest
