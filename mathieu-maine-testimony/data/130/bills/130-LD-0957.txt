Page 1 - 130LR1359(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §1902, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 113, Pt. A, §2, is 
3 amended to read:
41.  Authority of court to order deferment and impose requirements; 
5administrative supervision fee.   Following the acceptance of a plea of guilty for a crime 
6 for which a person is eligible for a deferred disposition under section 1901, the court may 
7 order sentencing deferred to a date certain or determinable and impose requirements upon 
8 the person, including the requirement that the person complete an alternative sentencing 
9 program, to be in effect during the period of deferment, considered by the court to be 
10 reasonable and appropriate to assist the person to lead a law-abiding life.  The court-
11 imposed deferment requirements must include a requirement that the person refrain from 
12 criminal conduct and may include a requirement that the person pay to the appropriate 
13 county an administrative supervision fee of not more than $50 per month, as determined 
14 by the court, for the term of the deferment.  In determining the amount of the fee, the court 
15 shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden its 
16 payment imposes.  In exchange for the deferred sentencing, the person shall abide by the 
17 court-imposed deferment requirements.  Unless the court orders otherwise, the 
18 requirements are immediately in effect.
19Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §1606, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 506, §1, is further 
20 amended to read:
211.  Participation in public works projects authorized.  The sheriff in charge of a 
22 county jail, or the sheriff of a county that shares a regional jail with other counties, may 
23 permit certain inmates of that jail to participate in alternative sentencing programs ordered 
24 pursuant to Title 17-A, section 1902, subsection 1 or other public works-related projects or 
25 in the improvement of property owned by charitable organizations in that county or another 
26 county.  A project or improvement must be supervised by the sheriff of the county in which 
27 the project or improvement is being conducted.  The sheriff may request payment from 
28 charitable organizations for the transportation of the prisoners and for the transportation 
29 and per diem compensation for any guards who accompany the prisoners.  For the purposes 
30 of this section, "charitable organization" means any nonprofit organization organized or 
31 incorporated in this State or having a principal place of business in this State that is exempt 
32 from federal income taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
33 Section 501(a), because the nonprofit organization is described in the United States Internal 
34 Revenue Code of 1986, Section 501(c)(3).
35SUMMARY
36 This bill allows the court to sentence to an alternative sentencing program a person 
37 who is eligible for a deferred disposition.  This bill also authorizes a sheriff in charge of a 
38 county jail or in a county that shares a regional jail with other counties to permit an inmate 
39 who has been sentenced to an alternative sentencing program to participate in that program.36
