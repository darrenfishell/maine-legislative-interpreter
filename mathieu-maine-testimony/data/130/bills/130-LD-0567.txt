Page 1 - 130LR0704(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  Reduction in early retirement penalty for certain state employees

4 subsection 3-A or any other provision of law to the contrary, beginning October 1, 2021 
5 the reduction in the retirement benefit for a qualified member is 2.25% for each year that 
6 the qualified member's age precedes 62 years of age at retirement.
7 As used in this section, "qualified member" means a member of the Maine Public 
8 Employees Retirement System who:
9 1.  Retired from service as a state employee between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 
10 or as a teacher between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2012;
11 2.  Had completed 25 or more years of creditable service upon retirement;
12 3.  Had neither 10 years of creditable service nor had reached 60 years of age with one 
13 year of creditable service immediately before July 1, 1993; and
14 4.  Had not attained 62 years of age as of retirement from service as a state employee 
15 or teacher.
16 As used in this section, the terms "creditable service," "employee," "member," 
17 "retirement," "retirement benefit," "state employee" and "teacher" have the same meanings 
18 as in Title 5, section 17001.
19SUMMARY
20 Under changes made to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System in 1993, 
21 employees who were members of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System as of 
22 July 1, 1993 but did not have 10 years of creditable service as of July 1, 1993 are required 
23 to have 25 years of creditable service and attain 62 years of age in order to avoid incurring 
24 a penalty of 6% of earned benefits for each year the person retires before attaining 62 years 
25 of age.  Prior to that change, the penalty was 2.25% for each year below 60 years of age 
26 the person retired.
27 Beginning October 1, 2021, this bill changes the rate of the penalty for those state 
28 employees who retired between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 and for teachers who 
29 retired between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2012 who had at least 25 years of service on July 
30 1, 2011 but had not attained 62 years of age to 2.25% for each year the person was below 
31 62 years of age upon retirement from service.20
