15 when:
16 A.  The plaintiff manufacturer or stewardship organization has incurred more than 
17 $3,000 in actual, direct costs in collecting, handling and disposing of covered drugs 
18 that are household pharmaceutical waste sold or offered for sale in the State by a

34 manufacturer or stewardship organization requested an independent audit and the 
35 audit verified the validity of the reimbursement request.
36 As used in this subsection, "damages" means the actual, direct costs a plaintiff 
37 manufacturer or stewardship organization incurs in collecting, handling and disposing of 
38 covered drugs that are household pharmaceutical waste reasonably identified as having

8 programs.  A local government may not adopt an ordinance mandating a 
9 manufacturer-funded drug take-back, collection or disposal program and any ordinance or 
10 regulation that violates this subsection is void and has no force or effect.
11Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §1776, sub-§11, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 315, §7, is amended
