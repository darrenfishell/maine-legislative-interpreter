31SUMMARY
32 This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 
33 vehicles, including commercial motor vehicles, buses and camper trailers, and mobile 
34 homes registered in the State.
35 With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles and buses and special mobile 
36 equipment, current law requires that the excise tax be based upon the maker's list price for 
37 the motor vehicle or mobile home; the excise tax on certain commercial motor vehicles and 
38 buses and special mobile equipment is based on the purchase price.  This bill requires that 
39 the excise tax for all motor vehicles, mobile homes and camper trailers be based upon the 
40 actual value of the vehicle or mobile home at the time of delivery to the owner, as 
41 determined by sources approved by the State Tax Assessor.32

Page 3 - 130LR0700(01)1 Current law requires the State to reimburse a municipality for the difference in the 
2 amount of excise tax that would have been collected by the municipality on each 
3 commercial motor vehicle or bus using the manufacturer's suggested retail price instead of 
4 the actual purchase price.  This bill applies that requirement to all vehicles registered and 
5 taxed by the municipality using the actual value.
