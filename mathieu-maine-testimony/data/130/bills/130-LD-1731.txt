Page 1 - 130LR2081(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, a number of private wells in the Town of Belgrade have evidenced chloride 
4 contamination stemming from nearby sand and salt storage facilities, and this poses a 
5 serious threat to the health and well-being of the inhabitants of the area; and
6Whereas, an adequate supply of pure water is essential to the health and well-being 
7 of the inhabitants of the Town of Belgrade; and
8Whereas, the formation of a water district in the Town of Belgrade will ensure the 
9 supply of pure water for the town's inhabitants; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13 therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

30 the district's service is provided.  Notwithstanding Title 35-A, section 6410, subsection 3, 
31 any municipal officer, as defined in Title 30-A, section 2001, subsection 10, or other elected 
32 official is eligible for appointment as a trustee of the district. At no time may more than 2 
33 municipal officers or elected officials serve as trustees of the district.
34Sec. 5.  First board.  The first board of trustees of the district is appointed by the

40 Belgrade pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 6410, subsection 2.
Page 2 - 130LR2081(01)1Sec. 7.  Referendum; effective date. This Act takes effect when approved only for 
2 the purpose of permitting its submission to the legal voters within the Town of Belgrade at 
3 an election called for that purpose and held within 3 years of the effective date of this Act. 
4 The election must be called, advertised and conducted according to the law relating to 
5 municipal elections, except that the registrar of voters is not required to prepare or the clerk 
6 to post a new list of voters. For the purpose of registration of voters, the registrar of voters 
7 must be in session the secular day preceding the election. The subject matter of this Act is 
8 reduced to the following question:
9 "Do you favor creating the Belgrade Water District?"
10 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or 
11 "No" their opinion of the same.
12 The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Belgrade and 
13 due certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
14 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority 
15 of the legal voters voting at the election. Failure to achieve the necessary approval in any 
16 referendum does not prohibit subsequent referenda consistent with this section, as long as 
17 the referenda are held within 3 years of the effective date of this Act.
18Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
19 takes effect when approved.
