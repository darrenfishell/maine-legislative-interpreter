Fiscal Note 
Municipalities may choose to reimburse for new training 
Current law requires certain basic training for harbor masters and deputy harbor masters. This bill requires 8 hours of 
additional training every 3 years for a person appointed or reappointed a harbor master or deputy harbor master. It 
also requires a fonner harbor master or deputy harbor master who has not held the position within the last 5 years to 
complete the basic harbor master training again. With approximately 200 harbor masters in the State, the statewide 
cost of this bill is estimated between $10,000 and $15,000 every three years. The bill is not a state mandate because 
there is no requirement that municipalities pay for the training. However, it is reasonable to assume that some 
municipalities will choose to cover or reimburse these costs as part of the benefits package offered to the individuals 
involved.
