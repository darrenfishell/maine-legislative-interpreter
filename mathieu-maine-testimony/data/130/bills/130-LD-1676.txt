40 person or concerning the prosecution's evidence that will interfere with the ability of a

197.  Unlawful dissemination of confidential juvenile intelligence and investigative 
20record information.  Any person who intentionally or knowingly disseminates

24Sec. 19.  15 MRSA §3308-C is enacted to read:
25§3308-C.  Confidentiality of juvenile case records
261.  Confidentiality.  Juvenile case records are confidential and may not be disclosed, 
27 disseminated or inspected except as expressly authorized by this Part.  Juvenile case records 
28 open to public inspection may be inspected only at the courthouse.  The court may not 
29 disseminate any juvenile case records, including those open to public inspection, to the 
30 public in any manner, including by any paper or electronic means.  
312.  Juvenile petitions open to public inspection.  Unless Juvenile Court proceedings 
32 are suspended pursuant to section 3318-A, subsection 5, the following juvenile petitions 
33 are open to public inspection:
34 A.  Any juvenile petition alleging a violation of Title 17-A, section 201, 202 or 203 if 
35 the juvenile charged had attained 13 years of age at the time of the alleged juvenile 
36 crime, if:  
37 (1)  The juvenile had a first appearance with respect to the petition in the Juvenile 
38 Court at least 30 days prior to the request for inspection of the petition; and  
39 (2)  The Juvenile Court has found there is probable cause to believe the juvenile 
40 committed a juvenile crime that would be a violation of Title 17-A, section 201, 
41 202 or 203 if the juvenile involved were an adult.
Page 7 - 130LR0084(01)1 If the juvenile had not attained 13 years of age at the time of the alleged violation of 
2 Title 17-A, section 201, 202 or 203, the Juvenile Court may allow public inspection of 
3 the juvenile petition pursuant to paragraph C; 
4 B.  Any juvenile petition alleging a juvenile crime that would constitute a Class A 
5 crime if committed by an adult if the juvenile charged had attained 13 years of age at 
6 the time of the alleged juvenile crime, if: 
7 (1)  The juvenile had a first appearance with respect to the petition in the Juvenile 
8 Court at least 30 days prior to the request for inspection of the petition; and 
9 (2) The Juvenile Court has found there is probable cause to believe the juvenile 
10 committed a juvenile crime that would be a Class A crime if the juvenile involved 
11 were an adult. 
12 If the juvenile had not attained 13 years of age at the time of the juvenile crime that 
13 would constitute a Class A crime if committed by an adult, the Juvenile Court may 
14 allow public inspection of the juvenile petition pursuant to paragraph C.  
15 A petition open to public inspection under this paragraph may be made confidential 
16 and not open to public inspection if, upon written request by a person to the Juvenile 
17 Court, and after notice to the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or 
18 legal custodian, the attorney for the juvenile and the office of the prosecuting attorney, 
19 and after a hearing in which the Juvenile Court considers the purposes of this Part, the 
20 juvenile's and alleged victim's interest in privacy, the nature of the juvenile crime 
21 alleged and the characteristics of the juvenile and public safety concerns as outlined in 
22 section 3101, subsection 4, paragraph D, the court determines that the general public's 
23 right to information does not substantially outweigh the juvenile's interest in privacy; 
24 and
25 C.  Any petition alleging a juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A 
26 crime if committed by an adult and the juvenile charged had not attained 13 years of 
27 age at the time of the alleged juvenile crime, or any petition alleging a juvenile of any 
28 age committed a juvenile crime that would constitute a Class B or C crime if committed 
29 by an adult, if:
30 (1)  The juvenile had a first appearance with respect to the petition in the Juvenile 
31 Court at least 30 days prior to the request for inspection of the petition; 
32 (2)  A written request is filed by any person with the Juvenile Court requesting that 
33 the juvenile petition be open to public inspection;
34 (3)  The Juvenile Court has found there is probable cause to believe the juvenile 
35 committed a juvenile crime that would constitute murder, a violation of Title 17-A, 
36 section 204 or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were an adult; and
37 (4)  After notice to the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or 
38 legal custodian, the attorney for the juvenile, the office of the prosecuting attorney 
39 and the individual or entity requesting the juvenile petition be open to public 
40 inspection and a hearing in which the Juvenile Court considers the purposes of this 
41 Part, the alleged victim's interest in privacy, the nature of the juvenile crime alleged 
42 and the characteristics of the juvenile and public safety concerns as outlined in 
43 section 3101, subsection 4, paragraph D, the court determines that the general 
Page 8 - 130LR0084(01)44 public's right to information substantially outweighs the juvenile's interest in 
45 privacy.
3 In a juvenile petition alleging multiple juvenile crimes, the juvenile crime that would 
4 constitute the highest class of crime if the juvenile were an adult determines whether the 
5 petition is open to public inspection.
6 The Juvenile Court shall redact the names and identifying information of any alleged minor 
7 victims prior to the inspection of a juvenile petition.
8 If a request to allow public inspection of a petition under this subsection has been filed, the 
9 Juvenile Court shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or 
10 legal custodian that the request has been made and shall advise them of the juvenile's right 
11 to be represented by counsel.  The court may not allow the public to inspect a juvenile 
12 petition pursuant to paragraph C until authorized by court order.
133.  Orders of adjudication open to public inspection.  Orders of adjudication for any 
14 juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile 
15 involved were an adult are open to public inspection.  Orders of adjudication for all other 
16 juvenile crimes are confidential and not open to public inspection. When an order of 
17 adjudication reflects adjudications for both a juvenile crime that would constitute murder 
18 or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were an adult and another juvenile crime 
19 or crimes not constituting murder or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were 
20 an adult, information regarding any additional juvenile crimes must be redacted before 
21 allowing public inspection of the order of adjudication. 
224.  Dissemination of information contained in juvenile case records.  The following 
23 provisions apply to the dissemination of information contained in juvenile case records.
24 A.  For purposes of this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
25 following terms have the following meanings.

33 case records by one criminal justice agency with another criminal justice agency for 
34 the purpose of administration of criminal justice, administration of juvenile justice or 
35 criminal justice agency employment. 
36 C.  Nothing in this section precludes dissemination of any information contained in

40 report on the health, behavior or progress of the juvenile, the superintendent of the

42 agencies that are or might become responsible for the health or welfare of the 1
2

7 disclosed or disseminated, except as otherwise provided by law.
8 D.  Nothing in this section precludes dissemination of any information in the juvenile 
9 case records in the possession of the Department of Corrections if the person 
10 concerning whom the juvenile case records are sought, the juvenile, the person's legal 
11 guardian, if any, and, if the person is a minor, the person's parent or parents, guardian 
12 or legal custodian have given informed written consent to the dissemination of the

16 all other reports of social and clinical studies contained in juvenile case records may 
17 not be open to inspection and may not be disclosed or disseminated except with the 
18 consent of the Juvenile Court. The names and identifying information regarding any 
19 alleged victims and minors contained in the juvenile case records must be redacted 
20 prior to disclosure, dissemination or inspection.
21 The Juvenile Court may not order the disclosure, dissemination or inspection of 
22 juvenile case records unless the juvenile, the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or 
23 legal custodian and either the juvenile's attorney or, if the juvenile does not have an 
24 attorney, the juvenile's attorney of record and the prosecuting attorney are given notice 
25 of the request and an opportunity to be heard regarding the request.  In deciding 
26 whether to allow the disclosure, dissemination or inspection of any portion of juvenile 
27 case records under this paragraph, the Juvenile Court shall consider the purposes of 
28 this Part and the reasons for which the request is being made and may restrict the 
29 disclosure, dissemination or inspection of the juvenile case records in any manner the 
30 court determines necessary or appropriate. 
31 F.  When a juvenile who is adjudicated as having committed a juvenile crime that if 
32 committed by an adult would be gross sexual assault under Title 17-A, section 253, 
33 subsection 1 is committed to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility 
34 or placed on probation, the Department of Corrections shall provide, while the juvenile 
35 is committed or on probation, a copy of the juvenile's judgment and commitment to the 
36 Department of Health and Human Services, to all law enforcement agencies that have 
37 jurisdiction in those areas where the juvenile resides, works or attends school and to 
38 the superintendent of any school in which the juvenile attends school during the period 
39 of commitment or probation.  The Department of Corrections shall provide a copy of 
40 the juvenile's judgment and commitment to all licensed day care facility operators 
41 located in the municipality where the juvenile resides, works or attends school during 
42 the period of commitment or probation.  Upon request, the Department of Corrections 
43 shall also provide a copy of the juvenile's judgment and commitment to other entities 
44 that are involved in the care of children and are located in the municipality where the 
45 juvenile resides, works or attends school during the period of commitment or probation.  1

Page 10 - 130LR0084(01)46 The Department of Corrections may provide a copy of the juvenile's judgment and 
47 commitment to any other agency or person that the Department of Corrections 
48 determines is appropriate to ensure public safety.  Neither the failure of the Department 
49 of Corrections to perform the requirements of this paragraph nor compliance with this 
50 paragraph subjects the Department of Corrections or its employees to liability in a civil 
51 action. 
7 G.  Juvenile case records must be open to inspection by and, upon request, be 
8 disseminated to the juvenile, the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or legal

15 provisions of this section, the juvenile petition and order of adjudication may be inspected 
16 by:
17 A.  The victim;
18 B.  If the victim is a minor, the parent or parents, guardian or legal custodian of the 
19 victim; or
20 C.  If the victim cannot act on the victim's own behalf due to death, age, physical or 
21 mental disease or disorder or intellectual disability or autism or other reason, an 
22 immediate family member, guardian, legal custodian or attorney representing the 
23 victim.
24 Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, juvenile case records must 
25 be open to inspection by or may be disseminated to the Victims' Compensation Board 
26 established in Title 5, section 12004-J, subsection 11 if a juvenile is alleged to have 
27 committed an offense upon which an application to the board is based.
286.  Access to juvenile case records by other persons.  With the consent of the Juvenile 
29 Court and subject to reasonable limitations to protect the identity, privacy and safety of 3rd 
30 parties, including, but not limited to, victims and other accused or adjudicated juveniles, 
31 and the interests of justice, juvenile case records, excluding the names of the juvenile and 
32 the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or legal custodian, the juvenile's attorney or any 
33 other parties, may be inspected by or disseminated to persons having a legitimate interest 
34 in the proceedings or by persons conducting pertinent research studies.
357.  Order following determination that juvenile case records are open to public 
36inspection, disclosure or dissemination.  Following a determination that a juvenile 
37 petition, order of adjudication or other juvenile case records are open to public inspection, 
38 disclosure or dissemination under this section, the Juvenile Court shall enter an order 
39 specifying which juvenile case records may be inspected, disclosed or disseminated and 
40 identifying the individual or agency granted access to those juvenile case records.  The 
41 Juvenile Court may restrict the further disclosure, dissemination or inspection of the 
42 juvenile case records in any manner the court determines necessary or appropriate.

46 includes suspension of the juvenile's right to operate a motor vehicle, the court shall 
47 transmit to the Secretary of State an abstract, duly certified, setting forth the name of the 
48 juvenile, the offense, the date of the offense, the date of the adjudicatory hearing and any 
49 other pertinent facts.  These juvenile case records are admissible in evidence in hearings 
50 conducted by the Secretary of State or any of the Secretary of State's deputies and are open 
51 to public inspection.
8 Nothing in this Part may be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of State, 
9 pursuant to Title 29-A, to suspend a person's driver's license or permit to operate a motor 
10 vehicle, right to operate a motor vehicle or right to apply for or obtain a driver's license.

21 case records of a person adjudicated as having committed a juvenile crime.
22 A.  A person adjudicated as having committed a juvenile crime that, if the juvenile 
23 were an adult, would constitute murder or a Class A, B or C crime or operating under 
24 the influence as defined in Title 29-A, section 2411 may petition the Juvenile Court to 
25 seal from public inspection all juvenile case records pertaining to the juvenile crime 
26 and its disposition and any prior juvenile case records and their dispositions if:  
27 (1)  At least 3 years have passed since the person's discharge from the disposition 
28 ordered for that juvenile crime;
29 (2)  Since the date of disposition, the person has not been adjudicated as having 
30 committed a juvenile crime and has not been convicted of committing a crime; and
31 (3)  There are no current adjudicatory proceedings pending for a juvenile or other 
32 crime.
33 B.  The Juvenile Court may grant the petition filed under paragraph A if the court finds 
34 that the requirements of paragraph A are satisfied, unless the court finds that the general 
35 public's right to information substantially outweighs the juvenile's interest in privacy.  
36 The juvenile has a right to appeal the court's denial of the juvenile's petition to seal as 
37 provided in chapter 509.
38 C.  At the time a person adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime other than a 
39 crime listed in paragraph A is finally discharged from the disposition imposed for that 
40 juvenile crime, the court, upon receipt of appropriate notice of the discharge, shall 
41 immediately enter an order sealing from public inspection all records pertaining to the 
42 juvenile crime and its disposition.  Appropriate notice that the juvenile is discharged

7
Page 12 - 130LR0084(01)1 (1)  Must be provided to the court by the Department of Corrections if the juvenile's 
2 disposition involved either commitment to the custody of a Department of 
3 Corrections juvenile correctional facility, a period of confinement not to exceed 30 
4 days or any suspended disposition with a period of probation;
5 (2)  Must be provided to the court by the office of the prosecuting attorney if 
6 disposition included restitution, community service or a restorative justice event 
7 and the court ordered that proof of completion of the obligation be provided to the 
8 office of the prosecuting attorney; or
9 (3)  May be provided to the court by the juvenile or the juvenile's attorney.  If the 
10 notice is provided by the juvenile or the juvenile's attorney, the juvenile or the 
11 juvenile's attorney shall serve a copy of the notice on the office of the prosecuting 
12 attorney before the court may enter the order sealing the juvenile case records.
13 D.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, subsection 4, paragraphs C, D and F and 
14 subsections 5 and 6, a court order sealing juvenile case records pursuant to this 
15 subsection permits only the following persons to have access to the sealed juvenile case 
16 records:
17 (1)  The courts and criminal justice agencies as provided by this section; and
18 (2)  The person whose juvenile case records are sealed or that person's designee.

20 to seal juvenile case records pursuant to paragraph B or its order of immediate sealing

25 of the order shall promptly update its records relating to each of the juvenile 
26 adjudications included in the order.
27 F.  A person whose juvenile case records are sealed pursuant to this subsection may 
28 respond to inquiries from other than the courts and criminal justice agencies about that 
29 person's juvenile crimes, the juvenile case records of which have been sealed, as if the 
30 juvenile crimes had never occurred, without being subject to any sanctions.  The sealing 
31 of a person's juvenile case records does not remove or otherwise affect the prohibition 
32 against that person's possessing a firearm pursuant to section 393. 
3311.  Unlawful dissemination of confidential juvenile case record information.  Any 
34 person who intentionally or knowingly disseminates information contained in confidential 
35 juvenile case records commits a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $1,000 
36 may be adjudged.  The District Court has jurisdiction over violations under this subsection.

5 would constitute a Class D or Class E crime if the juvenile involved were an adult or a 
6 violation of section 3103, subsection 1, paragraph B or C arising from the same course of 
7 conduct, the Juvenile Court may order that charges alleging conduct that would be a Class 
8 D or Class E crime if the juvenile involved were an adult or a violation of section 3103, 
9 subsection 1, paragraph B or C be adjudicated in a separate hearing.  When the Juvenile 
10 Court so orders, the general public must be excluded from the hearing on alleged conduct

12 of section 3103, subsection 1, paragraph B or C.

31 3203‑A, subsection 5.

20SUMMARY
21 This bill defines "confidential juvenile history record information" and "public juvenile 
22 history record information" and creates statutory authority governing the dissemination of 
23 juvenile history record information by a Maine criminal justice agency to create 
24 consistency between which juvenile case records may be open to public inspection at the 
25 courts and information that may be shared publicly by a criminal justice agency.  It provides 
26 a definition of "administration of juvenile justice" for all of the Maine Juvenile Code and 
27 amends several provisions to make consistent the use of the term "administration of 
28 juvenile justice" and deletes the term "administration of juvenile criminal justice."
29 It modifies the Maine Juvenile Code to limit access to juvenile case records maintained 
30 by Juvenile Courts and reorganizes existing provisions based on whether they allow 
31 disclosure of a juvenile's identity, allow inspection of juvenile case records, allow 
32 dissemination of juvenile case records or allow the general public access to Juvenile Court 
33 proceedings. It provides that a victim or an agent of the victim may inspect the juvenile 
34 petition and order of adjudication regardless of whether the general public may do so.
35 This bill allows automatic public inspection of a juvenile petition only if the petition 
36 alleges murder, felony murder or manslaughter, the juvenile has attained 13 years of age at 
37 the time of the offense and at least 30 days have passed since the juvenile's first appearance 
38 in the Juvenile Court.  A juvenile petition that alleges a juvenile who was at least 13 years 
39 of age when the juvenile committed a Class A crime are open to public inspection 30 days 
40 after the juvenile's first appearance unless the court orders the petition confidential.  A 
41 juvenile petition alleging that a juvenile under 13 years of age committed murder or a Class 
42 A crime and a petition alleging a juvenile of any age committed a Class B or Class C crime 
43 are confidential unless the Juvenile Court authorizes public inspection.  1

Page 18 - 130LR0084(01)1 A juvenile petition may be open to public inspection 30 days after the juvenile's first 
2 appearance in the Juvenile Court to ensure that the Juvenile Court has determined there is 
3 probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the crime alleged and there is no assertion 
4 that the juvenile is not competent to proceed in the Juvenile Court.
5 It provides that only orders of adjudication for juvenile crimes that would constitute 
6 murder or Class A, B or C crimes if the juvenile were an adult are open to public inspection 
7 and dissemination by a court or criminal justice agency.
8 It clarifies that the general public may not be excluded from any Juvenile Court 
9 proceeding when a juvenile petition is open to public inspection pursuant to statute or court 
10 order.  A victim or an agent of the victim may be present at all court proceedings regardless 
11 of whether the proceedings are open to the general public.
12 It provides for the automatic sealing of juvenile case records for crimes that, if the 
13 juvenile were an adult, would constitute Class D crimes, other than operating under the 
14 influence, or Class E crimes upon the completion of the disposition ordered by the Juvenile 
15 Court.  The sealing procedure would remain unchanged for Class A, Class B and Class C 
16 crimes and murder.
17 It makes all juvenile case records and all Juvenile Court proceedings confidential when 
18 Juvenile Court proceedings are suspended due to an assertion by the juvenile, the State or 
19 the court that the juvenile may not be competent to proceed in the Juvenile Court.  Juvenile 
20 case records and Juvenile Court proceedings remain confidential unless the Juvenile Court 
21 proceedings resume after the juvenile is found competent.
22 This bill creates a new civil cause of action for a person about whom confidential 
23 records or information has been disclosed in knowing or intentional violation of the Maine 
24 Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 3010, subsection 6 or section 3308-A, subsection 4.  A 
25 person who brings and prevails in such a civil action is entitled to injunctive relief, 
26 reimbursement of court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, an award of actual damages 
27 of up to $5,000 and award of punitive damages.  It also creates a new civil violation for 
28 which any person who intentionally or knowingly disseminates confidential juvenile 
29 history may be fined up to $1,000.
