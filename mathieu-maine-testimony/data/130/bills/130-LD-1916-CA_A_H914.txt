SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. It creates the Lobster Legal 
Defense Fund in the Department of Marine Resources to provide money for legal actions 
involving the regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction 
Plan. In addition to a general fund appropriation by the Legislature into this nonlapsing 
fund, the department shall deposit 20% of the license surcharges assessed by the department 
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 6455-A, subsection 11. 
Until June 30, 2024, the department is to distribute money from the fund to itself in an 
amount sufficient to reimburse the depatiment for costs incurred in administering the fund 
during the preceding 12-month period. Of the remaining balance, 1/2 must be distributed 
to a statewide association of individuals engaged in commercial lobster fishing and 1/2 to 
the labor union representing individuals engaged in commercial lobster fishing in the State 
for legal costs incurred and paid in legal proceedings involving the regulations of the United 
States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan. 
Any money remaining in the fund on June 30, 2024 is required to be deposited by the 
department into the Lobster Promotion Fund up to an amount equal to the license 
surcharges placed in the Lobster Legal Defense Fund. Any money remaining in the fund 
is then retained by the department. 
The department is required to submit a report to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over marine resources matters by February 15, 2024 and the 
committee has the authority to report out a bill in response to the contents of the report 
during the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature. 
The provisions establishing and governing the Lobster Legal Defense Fund are 
repealed October 1, 2024. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.

This bill creates the Lobster Legal Defense Fund (LLDF) within the Department of Marine Resources (DMR). For 2 
years 20% of license surcharges currently credited to the Lobster Promotion Fund (LPF) are to be credited to the 
LLDF. The bill includes an allocation of $380,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 to the LLDF and a deallocation of $380,000 
to the LPF to reflect this revenue shift. Half the funds will be distributed to a lobster association and half to a labor 
union representing individuals engaged in commercial lobster fishing in the State for legal costs incurred and paid in 
legal proceedings involving the regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan. The bill also includes a 
General Fund appropriation to the DMR of $500,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 with the intent that the same amount be 
appropriated in fiscal year 2023-24. The appropriation will be used to increase funding to the LLDF. Any funds 
remaining in the LLDF on June 31, 2024 will be moved back to the Lobster Promotion Fund.
