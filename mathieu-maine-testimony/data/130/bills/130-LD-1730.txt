46 necessary expenses. The costs for services rendered and expenses incurred by the State 
47 Board of Arbitration and Conciliation and any state allocation program charges must be 
48 shared equally by the parties to the proceedings and must be paid into a special fund

54 executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties, as appropriate, for any difference 
55 between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of providing the

63 any sums due and payable pursuant to this provision through civil action.  In such an action, 
64 the court shall allow litigation costs, including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, 
65 to be deposited in the General Fund if the executive director is the prevailing party in the

67 activities of the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation to the Governor.  The board 
68 shall from time to time adopt rules of procedure as it determines necessary, including rules
