B. The commissioner shall decide whether an application meets the permit by rule 
provisions under subsection 7 within 20 working days after notifying the applicant of 
acceptance of the application, except that the commissioner shall decide whether an 
application to undertake an activity that requires a permit pursuant to chapter 3, 
subchapter 1, article 6 meets the permit by rule provisions under subsection 7 within a 
time period set pursuant to the provisions of section 344-B. 
Sec. 5. Governor's Energy Office to plan for pilot program to study 
feasibility of dual-use projects. The Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this 
section as "the office," in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry, the Public Utilities Commission and other state agencies and stakeholders, 
including research institutions, shall develop a plan to implement a dual-use energy pilot 
program, referred to in this section as "the pilot program plan, 11 to test and study the efficacy 
and potential benefits of innovative solar energy systems that are connected to the electric 
transmission and distribution utility system and are located on natural and developed areas, 
including, but not limited to, farmland that is maintained in active agricultural or 
horticultural use, parking lots and aquatic sites. For purposes of this section, "dual-use 
project" means a mixed-use system combining use ofland or aquatic sites with solar energy 
production. 
The pilot program plan must: 
1. Identify potential dual-use projects that collectively have a total capacity of 30 
megawatts, with at least 20 megawatts reserved for dual-use projects on agricultural land, 
and that may warrant inclusion in a pilot program based on criteria including but not limited 
to emerging or potential commercial viability, potential applicability to the State, and 
potential to contribute meaningfully and cost-effectively to achievement of the goals 
established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210, subsection 1-A; 
2. Identify and include eligibility criteria for dual-use projects to be included in the 
pilot program, including, but not limited to, the continuation of agricultural or horticultural 
uses of the affected land; 
3. Identify if financial incentives, location-based incentives or other incentives to dual­
use projects that would be considered for inclusion in the pilot program would be necessary, 
including mechanisms to minimize the cost of the pilot program to electric ratepayers in 
the State; 
4. Ensure all approved agricultural dual-use projects permit the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to conduct or direct research on compatible crops, 
grazing operations and other agricultural or horticultural uses of the land to determine best 
practices for dual-use projects. The determination of best practices must consider both the 
duration of uses of the land and the energy production of the solar energy system; 
5. Include an application process for landowners seeking to be included in the pilot 
program, including landowners who have already deployed or are planning to deploy solar 
energy systems; 
6. Examine benefits of dual-use project applications to individual landowners, the 
electric transmission and distribution utility system and the State's ability to meet clean 
energy and climate goals; and

7. Include an evaluation process and selection criteria that may result in the approval 
of dual-use projects of varying sizes, in different geographic locations, that involve diverse 
types of sites and, if applicable, minimize negative impacts to farmland and the 
environment, and ensure appropriate innovation as well as planning for technical and 
financial feasibility, including interconnection with the electric transmission and 
distribution utility system. 
The office, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry, shall submit a report with a plan for implementing the pilot program to the joint 
standing committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation 
and forestry matters; energy and utilities matters; and environment and natural resources 
matters no later than March 1, 2023 and each joint standing committee may submit 
legislation relating to the subject matter of the report to the First Regular Session of the 
131st Legislature. 
Sec. 6. Governor's Energy Office to include agricultural and natural 
resource stakeholders in distributed generation project programs stakeholder 
group siting work sessions. The Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this section 
as 11the office, 11 shall convene, no later than September 1, 2022, siting work sessions of the 
distributed generation project programs stakeholder group convened by the office pursuant 
to Public Law 2021, chapter 390, section 4. These siting work sessions must include 
representatives from natural resource agencies, stakeholders representing agricultural and 
natural resource interests and members of the distributed generation project programs 
stakeholder group. The siting work sessions must focus on land use considerations and 
how such considerations may be incorporated into distributed generation policy, including 
siting distributed generation facilities and electric grid planning. Such land use 
considerations may include the prioritization of the use of contaminated lands, such as 
brownfields and land contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, 
rooftops, gravel pits and previously developed parcels, and other criteria that safeguard or 
avoid valuable agricultural land, rare, threatened and endangered species and rare and 
exemplary natural communities. The office shall convene at least 3 siting work sessions 
to develop recommendations to avoid, minimize and compensate for agricultural and 
natural resource impacts, including, but not limited to, an in-lieu fee mitigation program 
and preference in procurement or tariff programs. No later than January 1, 2023, the siting 
work sessions must result in a report, with findings and recommendations, to the distributed 
generation project programs stakeholder group.
