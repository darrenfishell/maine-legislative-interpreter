Page 1 - 130LR2441(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, during the most recent census, the United States Department of Commerce, 
4 United States Census Bureau contacted Waldo County about a discrepancy with the 
5 common boundary line between Waldo County and Knox County in Penobscot Bay, and 
6 this discrepancy must be resolved; and
7Whereas, Public Law 1828, chapter 372, which established Waldo County, 
8 established the southern boundary of the county as a line due east from the southern corner 
9 of the boundary line of the newly established Waldo County at approximately Jameson 
10 Point, along the town lines of Rockland and Camden, and across Penobscot Bay to where 
11 it met the Hancock County line; and
12Whereas, the southern boundary line of Waldo County established in Public Law 
13 1828, chapter 372 crossed Penobscot Bay south of the entire archipelago of Islesboro at 
14 approximately N 44° 06' 56"; and
15Whereas, Public Law 1860, chapter 146, which established Knox County, designated 
16 numerous municipalities and plantations from Waldo County and Lincoln County to the 
17 newly established Knox County, but was silent on the common border with Waldo County 
18 in Penobscot Bay; and
19Whereas, beginning in the 1940s, maps indicated the boundary line between Waldo 
20 County and Knox County in Penobscot Bay at approximately N 44° 12' 18", just south of 
21 Lime Island, which had the effect of dividing the archipelago of Islesboro between the 2 
22 counties; and
23Whereas, having timely clarification of and certainty about the common boundary 
24 between Waldo County and Knox County is essential for the residents of the counties, the 
25 next census and the creation of accurate maps of the counties; and
26Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
27 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
28 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
29 therefore,
30Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
31Sec. 1.  Boundary line.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a 
32 portion of the boundary line between Waldo County and Knox County in Penobscot Bay

35 and continuing through N 44° 12.18' and W 68° 54.05';
36 2.  Beginning at a point located at N 44° 9' and W 68° 56.45' in a westerly direction to
