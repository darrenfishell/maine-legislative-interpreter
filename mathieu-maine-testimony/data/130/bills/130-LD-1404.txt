2 wagering license under this section.
33.  Authority to conduct sports wagering; management services permitted.  A 
4 facility sports wagering license granted by the director pursuant to this section grants a 
5 licensee lawful authority to conduct sports wagering within the terms and conditions of the 
6 license and any rules adopted under this chapter.  A facility sports wagering licensee may 
7 contract with a management services licensee under section 1209.
84.  Fees.  The fee for an initial or renewed facility sports wagering license is $2,000 
9 and must be retained by the director for the costs of administering this chapter.  In addition 
10 to the license fee, the director may charge a processing fee for an initial or renewed license

13 may be charged to meet the actual cost. If the projected cost exceeds the actual cost, the 
14 difference may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
155.  Term of license.  Except as provided in subsection 6, a license granted or renewed 
16 under this section is valid for 2 years unless sooner revoked by the director under section 
17 1205.  The failure of an entity identified in subsection 2, paragraph A, B or C to maintain 
18 the underlying license described in that paragraph voids the entity's facility sports wagering 
19 license.
206.  Temporary license.  An applicant for a facility sports wagering license that is 
21 qualified under subsection 2, paragraph A, B or C may submit with the application a request 
22 for a temporary license.  An applicant for a facility sports wagering license that is qualified 
23 under subsection 2, paragraph D and that has a license to operate high-stakes beano under 
24 Title 17, section 314-A may submit with the application a request for a temporary license.
25 A request for a temporary license must include the initial license fee of $2,000.  If the 
26 director determines that the applicant is qualified under subsection 2, meets the 
27 requirements established by rule for a temporary license and has paid the initial license fee 
28 and the director is not aware of any reason the applicant is ineligible for a license under 
29 this section, the director may issue a temporary facility sports wagering license.  A 
30 temporary license issued under this subsection is valid for one year or until a final 
31 determination on the facility sports wagering license application is made, whichever is 
32 sooner.  If after investigation the director determines that the applicant is eligible for a 
33 facility sports wagering license under this chapter, the director shall issue the initial facility 
34 sports wagering license, at which time the temporary license terminates.  The initial facility 
35 sports wagering license is valid for 2 years from the date that the temporary license was 
36 issued by the director.  Sports wagering conducted under authority of a temporary license 
37 must comply with the facility operator's house rules adopted under section 1211.

39 temporary licensee under subsection 6, shall conduct sports wagering through persons 
40 holding a valid occupational license under section 1210.

44§1207.  Mobile sports wagering license
Page 10 - 130LR0678(01)11.  Issuance of license.  The director shall issue a mobile sports wagering license upon

17 investigations. If the actual cost exceeds the projected cost, an additional fee may be 
18 charged to meet the actual cost. If the projected cost exceeds the actual cost, the difference 
19 may be refunded to the applicant or licensee.
