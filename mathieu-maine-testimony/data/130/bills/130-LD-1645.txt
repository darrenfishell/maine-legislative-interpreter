35 establish and maintain a comprehensive record management system designed to reasonably 
36 ensure the accuracy, integrity and completeness of data and other information about 
37 cosigner release applications and to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal 
38 laws, including but not limited to the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the federal 
39 Fair Credit Reporting Act. The system required by this subsection must include the number
