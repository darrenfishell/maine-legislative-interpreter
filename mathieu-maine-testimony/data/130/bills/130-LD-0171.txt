2Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §12252, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 110, §8, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Licensure.  The board shall grant or renew a license to accounting firms that submit 
5 the application required by the board, pay the fee as set under section 12203 and 
6 demonstrate their qualifications in accordance with this section.
7 A.  A firm must hold a license issued under this section if it:
8 (1)  Has an office in this State performing any of the services described in section 
9 12201, subsection 3‑A, paragraphs A to D;
10 (2)  Has an office in this State that uses the title "CPA" or "CPA firm"; or
11 (3)  Does not have an office in this State and does not meet the requirements of 
12 section 12253 but performs any of the services described in section 12201, 
13 subsection 3‑A, paragraphs paragraph A, C or D for a client having its home office 
14 in this State.
15 B.  A firm that does not have an office in this State may perform services described in 
16 section 12201, subsection 3‑A, paragraph B or F for a client having its home office in 
17 this State and may use the title "CPA" or "CPA firm" without a license issued under 
18 this section only if:
19 (1)  It qualifies for a firm license pursuant to subsections 3 and 8 and it performs 
20 such services through an individual with practice privileges under section 12232; 
21 and  or
22 ( 2)  It performs such services through an individual with practice privileges under 
23 section 12232.
24 (3)  It meets the requirements of section 12253.
25 C.  A firm that is not subject to the requirements of paragraphs A and B may perform 
26 professional services other than those described in section 12201, subsection 3‑A while 
27 using the title "CPA" or "CPA firm" in this State without a license issued under this 
28 section only if the firm meets the requirements of section 12253 or:
29 (1)  Performs such services through an individual with practice privileges under 
30 section 12232; and
31 (2)  Has legal authority to perform such services in the state of that individual's 
32 principal place of business.
33Sec. 2.  32 MRSA §12253 is enacted to read:
34§12253.  Accountancy firm practice without license on the basis of substantial 
35equivalency
361.  Substantial equivalency.  A firm with a principal place of business outside the 
37 State is presumed to have qualifications substantially equivalent to the State's requirements 
38 and has all the privileges of licensees of the State and may provide professional services in 
39 the State without the requirement to obtain a license under this section or to otherwise 
40 notify or register with the board or pay any fee if the firm:
Page 2 - 130LR0636(01)1 A.  Holds a valid license as a certified public accountancy firm from a state that the 
2 board has verified to be in substantial equivalence with the certified public accountancy 
3 firm licensure requirements of a national association of state boards of accountancy 
4 and standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; 
5 or 
6 B.  Holds a valid license as a certified public accountancy firm from a state that is not 
7 in substantial equivalence with the certified public accountancy firm requirements 
8 under paragraph A, but the board determines that the certified public accountancy 
9 firm's qualifications are substantially equivalent to the certified public accountancy 
10 firm licensure requirements of a national association of state boards of accountancy 
11 and standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
12 In determining substantial equivalence, the board may consult determinations and 
13 verifications from a national qualification appraisal service of a national association of state 
14 boards of accountancy.
152.  No notice or other submission required.  Notwithstanding any provision of law 
16 to the contrary, a firm that is eligible to practice in this State without a license in accordance 
17 with the requirements of this section may offer or render professional services in this State, 
18 whether in person or by mail, telephone or electronic means, without providing notice or 
19 making any submission to the board. Such a firm is subject to subsection 3.
203.  Conditions.  A licensee of another state exercising the practice privilege afforded 
21 under this section must consent, as a condition of the grant of the practice privilege:
22 A.  To the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and disciplinary authority of the 
23 board;
24 B. To comply with the provisions of this chapter and the board's rules; and
25 C. To the stipulation that, in the event the license from the state of the firm's principal 
26 place of business is no longer valid, the firm will cease offering or rendering 
27 professional services in the State.
28SUMMARY
29 This bill establishes parity in license mobility between certified public accountancy 
30 firms and individual certified public accountants by enabling out-of-state certified public 
31 accountancy firms to provide services in Maine on the basis of substantial equivalency in 
32 the same manner as individual certified public accountants.  A certified public accountancy 
33 firm providing services in Maine on the basis of substantial equivalency need not provide 
34 notice or register with the Board of Accountancy but must follow the requirements of 
35 Maine law and the board's rules.
