Page 1 - 130LR1100(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §576-A, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 476, §7, is amended 
3 to read:
44.  Monitoring, reporting and compliance rules.  By July 1, 2021  2022, the 
5 department shall adopt rules to track and report to the Legislature on gross annual 
6 greenhouse gas emissions and net annual greenhouse gas emissions.
7 Notwithstanding any provision of section 341‑H to the contrary, by September 1, 2021  
8 2022, the board shall adopt rules to ensure compliance with the levels established by 
9 subsections 1 to 3 which  that:
10 A.  Must be consistent with the climate action plan, as updated pursuant to section 577, 
11 subsection 1;
12 B.  Must prioritize greenhouse gas emissions reductions by sectors that are the most 
13 significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, as identified by the United States 
14 Energy Information Administration and in the department's biennial reports submitted 
15 under section 578, taking into account gross greenhouse gas emissions reductions 
16 achieved by each sector since 1990 measured as a percentage of statewide gross 
17 greenhouse gas emissions and taking into account the cost-effectiveness of future gross 
18 greenhouse gas emissions reductions by each sector;
19 C.  Must be fair and equitable and account for and give significant weight to greenhouse 
20 gas emissions reductions already achieved by various sectors; and
21 D.  May establish a mechanism for crediting voluntary measures that quantifiably and 
22 reliably sequester additional carbon in forests, farms and coastal lands in the State or 
23 by the use of materials that sequester additional carbon that prioritizes sequestration 
24 that offsets Maine-generated emissions.
25 The Department of Transportation, after consultation with the department, may adopt rules 
26 as necessary to ensure compliance with the levels established by subsections 1 to 3.
27 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical  major substantive rules as 
28 defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2‑A.
29Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §576-A, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
305.  Exclusions.  Notwithstanding subsection 4, the board, the department or the 
31 Department of Transportation may not adopt a rule that:
32 A.  Increases the cost of heating fuel, natural gas, gasoline or diesel fuel by issuing 
33 permits to limit the amount of these fuels sold in the State in order to limit greenhouse 
34 gas emissions;
35 B.  Increases the cost of heating fuel, natural gas, gasoline or diesel fuel by imposing a 
36 tax or requiring a permitting fee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that is based on 
37 the carbon emissions of these fuels;
38 C.  Increases the cost of heating fuel, natural gas, gasoline or diesel fuel by imposing a 
39 tax or requiring a permitting fee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that is based on 
40 the carbon emissions of carbon-based fuels as part of a rebate or dividend program; or
Page 2 - 130LR1100(01)1 D.  Causes the State to join a multistate consortium or coalition that requires the State 
2 to implement a policy under paragraph A, B or C as a condition of membership.
3 A proposal to implement by legislation a policy described under paragraph A, B or C may 
4 not become law without the Senate and House of Representatives approving legislation 
5 both adopting that policy and joining a multistate consortium or coalition described under 
6 paragraph D.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill makes the rules adopted by the Board of Environmental Protection, the 
9 Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Transportation to limit 
10 greenhouse gas emissions major substantive rules.  It prohibits the adoption by the Board 
11 of Environmental Protection, the Department of Environmental Protection or the 
12 Department of Transportation of a rule that limits the amount of heating fuel, natural gas, 
13 gasoline or diesel fuel sold to limit greenhouse gas emissions, that imposes a tax or requires 
14 a permitting fee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including a tax or permitting fee that 
15 is based on the carbon emissions of any carbon-based fuels as part of a rebate or dividend 
16 program, or that causes the State to join a multistate consortium or coalition that requires 
17 the State to implement either of those policies as a condition of membership.  It also 
18 requires that a proposal to implement by legislation a policy limiting the sale of gasoline 
19 or diesel fuel to limit greenhouse gas emissions or imposing a tax or permitting fee to 
20 reduce greenhouse gas emissions may not become law without the Senate and House of 
21 Representatives approving legislation both adopting the policy and joining a multistate 
22 consortium or coalition.  It also requires that any carbon sequestration policy prioritize the 
23 offset of Maine-generated emissions.8
