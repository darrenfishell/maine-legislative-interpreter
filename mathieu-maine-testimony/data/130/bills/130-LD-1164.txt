30SUMMARY
31 This bill removes the prohibition against a municipal clerk's issuing an absentee ballot

33 application or written request for an absentee ballot is received in the municipal office after 
34 the 3rd business day before election day.  It also allows a municipality or jurisdiction that 
35 conducts its own elections to opt to process absentee ballots beginning on the 7th day 
36 immediately prior to election day, not the 4th day immediately prior to election day, as in 
37 current law.31
