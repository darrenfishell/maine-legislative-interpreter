This amendment provides for an 8-month suspension of the excise tax on gasoline and diesel motor vehicle fuel, 
reducing Highway Fund revenue by $37,450,000 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $115,200,000 in fiscal year 2022-23. The 
amendment includes a transfer of funds from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the unallocated 
surplus of the Highway Fund to offset this reduction in Highway Fund revenue and makes numerous adjustments to 
appropriations and other provisions in the bill to offset the impact on the General Fund of the transfer to the High1.X1"v 
Fund. A balanced budget is maintained. ·
