12 passed by the 130th Legislature, be accepted?"
13 The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or

17 Secretary of State.
18 This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a majority 
19 of the legal voters voting at the election.  Failure to achieve the necessary approval in any 
20 referendum does not prohibit subsequent referenda consistent with this section.
