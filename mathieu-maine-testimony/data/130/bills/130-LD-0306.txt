Page 1 - 130LR0643(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 has 
4 created a public health emergency; and
5Whereas, in response to this public health emergency, the Governor issued an 
6 executive order on March 18, 2020 requiring all restaurants to close their dine-in facilities; 
7 and
8Whereas, although restaurants across the State were permitted to reopen for dine-in 
9 service by June 17, 2020, they were required to limit indoor seating capacity and, beginning 
10 November 20, 2020, were additionally required to close their dine-in facilities by 9:00 p.m. 
11 nightly to prevent spread of the virus; and
12Whereas, the combined effects of the public health emergency and subsequent public 
13 health measures have negatively impacted the ability of restaurants to satisfy certain criteria 
14 for maintenance of their licenses to sell liquor for on-premises consumption under current 
15 law; and
16Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
17 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
18 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
19 therefore,
20Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
21Sec. 1.  One-time waiver of requirements for food sales for license renewal.

24 Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations under the Maine Revised 
25 Statutes, Title 28-A is not required to demonstrate that it has satisfied any applicable 
26 requirement under Title 28-A, chapter 43 for income from the sale of food during the 
27 previous year if the license to be renewed expires on or before January 1, 2022.
28Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
29 takes effect when approved.
30SUMMARY
