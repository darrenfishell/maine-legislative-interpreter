Page 1 - 130LR0408(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  Police officer eligible to return to Participating Local District 
3Retirement Program.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 
4 18252-A, subsection 1 or any other provision of law to the contrary, a police officer who 
5 was a member of the Participating Local District Retirement Program and who, pursuant 
6 to section 18252-A, subsection 1, did not elect to remain a member of that program and is 
7 covered under a plan provided by the employer under Title 5, section 18252-B may elect 
8 to become a member of the Participating Local District Retirement Program under the 
9 following conditions:
10 1.  The police officer must elect to return to the Participating Local District Retirement 
11 Program before January 1, 2022;
12 2.  The police officer must, in accordance with Title 5, section 18358, purchase service 
13 credit for the period during which the police officer elected not to be a member of the 
14 Participating Local District Retirement Program or for the police officer's total years of 
15 service if the police officer so chooses at the time of the election; and
16 3.  The police officer must, in accordance with Title 5, section 18304, repay 
17 contributions withdrawn unless doing so would require the employer, without the 
18 employer's agreement, to make an employer contribution to both the Participating Local 
19 District Retirement Program and the plan provided by the employer under Title 5, section 
20 18252-B.
21 A police officer who becomes a member of the Participating Local District Retirement 
22 Program under this Act and who terminates service, except by death or by retirement, may, 
23 at that member's discretion, withdraw accumulated contributions in accordance with Title 
24 5, section 18306-A but may not thereafter become a member of that program while 
25 employed by the same employer.
26SUMMARY
27 Current law states that a member of the Participating Local District Retirement 
28 Program on the date on which an employer offers an alternative retirement program may 
29 make a one-time irrevocable election to remain under that program or to join the alternative 
30 retirement plan offered by the employer. This bill allows police officers to make a one-time 
31 election to rejoin the Participating Local District Retirement Program under certain 
32 conditions.27
