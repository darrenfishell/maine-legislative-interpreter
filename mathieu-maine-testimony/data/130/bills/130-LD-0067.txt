10SUMMARY
11 This bill eliminates restrictions for the total number of discharge licenses allowed to 
12 be issued for Class AA and Class A waters.  It retains the requirement in current law that 
13 those discharges assist in the restoration of Atlantic salmon and will return the waters to a 
14 state that is closer to historically natural chemical quality.
