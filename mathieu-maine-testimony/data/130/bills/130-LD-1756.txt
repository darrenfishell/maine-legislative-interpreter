3 substantially altered except on the vote of 2/3 of all members elected to each House.
4Whereas, certain real estate authorized for conveyance by this resolve is under the 
5 designations described in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 598-A; and

7 and Lands may sell, lease or exchange lands with the approval of the Legislature in 
8 accordance with Title 12, sections 1814, 1837 and 1851; and 
9Whereas, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Parks 
10 and Lands holds an approximately 23.83% common and undivided interest in an 
11 approximately 20,222.5-acre parcel of land in T. 12, R. 13 in Aroostook County, which 
12 constitutes approximately 4,819 acres of state ownership, a minority of the parcel; and

16 constitutes approximately 1,624 acres of state ownership, a majority of both sections; and
17Whereas, due to lack of management control in T. 12, R. 13 and lack of good public 
18 access in T. 4, R. 8, it will benefit the people of Maine to sell interest in the 2 parcels for 
19 cash to purchase alternative lands within Aroostook County and Penobscot County, 
20 respectively, which can be managed for public benefits such as recreational access, wildlife 
21 habitat and sustainable timber harvest; and
