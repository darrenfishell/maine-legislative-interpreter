5Whereas, in response to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has declared a 
6 pandemic, the President of the United States has declared a national emergency and the 
7 Governor of Maine has declared a civil state of emergency; and
8Whereas, in response to COVID-19, the Governor of Maine has also proclaimed an 
9 insurance emergency pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, section 471 and, 
10 pursuant to that proclamation, the Superintendent of Insurance has issued orders relating to 
11 health insurance coverage for COVID-19 testing and immunization during the civil state
