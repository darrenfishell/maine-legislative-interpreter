Page 18 - 130LR0494(01)1 Part C makes changes to the property tax law.  Part C:
2 1.  Lowers the declared ratio accuracy threshold from within 20% to within 10% of the 
3 state valuation ratio last determined to align with the accuracy requirement provided for 
4 state reimbursement for the homestead exemption; and
5 2.  Updates and aligns the audit authority for exemptions that are reimbursed by the 
6 State to municipalities, allowing for the audit of all reimbursable exemptions.
7 Part D makes the following updates to respond to certain COVID-19 impacts and is 
8 effective when approved.  Part D:
9 1.  Aligns the Title 36 definitions of "disaster period" with the Title 10, section 9902 
10 definition;
11 2.  Relaxes the "work in Maine" requirement of the educational opportunity tax credit 
12 by deeming a qualified individual who worked in this State immediately prior to, or at any 
13 point during, the state of emergency declared by the Governor due to the COVID-19 
14 pandemic to have worked in this State for the entire state of emergency;
15 3.  Relaxes the primary use requirement of the sales tax exemption for machinery and 
16 equipment by determining the equipment's primary use based only on the days in use; and
17 4.  Allows taxpayers to use the sourcing law of another jurisdiction when calculating 
18 the credit for income tax paid to other jurisdictions in certain COVID-19 pandemic-related 
19 teleworking circumstances.
20 Part E clarifies and simplifies the corporate income tax law by establishing clearly 
21 defined, objective nexus thresholds as a practical structure for the current general 
22 "economic nexus" standard.  These so-called factor presence thresholds clarify the 
23 minimum thresholds that, when exceeded by a corporation, subject that corporation to the 
24 Maine corporate income tax.  In addition, the new thresholds create a safe harbor for 
25 corporations with little activity within the State that nonetheless have nexus under current 
26 law due to a small, but greater than de minimis, physical presence in the State.  The new 
27 thresholds are $250,000 of property, $250,000 in payroll or $500,000 in sales in Maine, or 
28 25% of total property, payroll or sales in Maine, as determined under Title 36, chapter 821.  
29 The thresholds apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
30 Part F updates, clarifies and simplifies the service provider tax law regarding consumer 
31 purchases of digital media by equalizing the tax treatment between the various modes of 
32 purchase for sales occurring on or after October 1, 2021.
