5Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3209-C is enacted to read:
6§3209-C.  Net energy billing requirement prohibited
7 The commission may not by rule or order require a transmission and distribution utility 
8 to allow a customer to participate in net energy billing. For the purposes of this section, 
9 "net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which a customer of a 
10 transmission and distribution utility has the ability to receive a bill credit or other 
11 adjustment of the customer's transmission and distribution service bill by delivering 
12 electricity to the transmission and distribution utility from an electric generating facility 
13 owned or operated by that customer or in which that customer has a financial interest that 
14 is located in the service territory of the transmission and distribution utility in the State.
15SUMMARY
16 This bill repeals the laws that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules 
17 governing net energy billing and that directed the commission to establish a net energy 
18 billing program for commercial and institutional customers of investor-owned transmission 
19 and distribution utilities and prohibits the commission from adopting rules that require a 
20 transmission and distribution utility to allow a customer to participate in net energy billing.
