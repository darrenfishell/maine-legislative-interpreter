Page 1 - 130LR1402(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
4 period in order to assist persons affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in completing 
5 advance health care directives; and
6Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
8 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
9 therefore,
10Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11Sec. 1.  18-C MRSA ยง5-803, sub-ยง11 is enacted to read:
1211.  Execution.  A written individual instruction, advance health care directive or 
13 power of attorney for health care may be signed by the principal or in the principal's 
14 conscious presence by another individual directed by the principal to sign the principal's 
15 name on the individual instruction, advance health care directive or power of attorney for 
16 health care.  For purposes of this subsection an individual appearing via telecommunication 
17 who is able to verify or recognize the identity of the principal and assess the principal's 
18 capacity is considered to be in the principal's conscious presence.  If necessary due to 
19 infectious disease protocols or other health concerns, an individual outside a hospital room 
20 where the patient who is the principal is located or in a location near the principal is also 
21 considered to be in the principal's conscious presence, as long as the individual can verify 
22 or recognize the identity of the principal and assess the principal's capacity.  A witness may 
23 also appear via telecommunication if that witness is able to verify or recognize the identity 
24 of the principal and assess the principal's capacity.  If necessary due to infectious disease 
25 protocols or other health concerns, an individual outside a hospital room where the patient 
26 who is the principal is located or in a location near the principal may also act as a witness, 
27 as long as that witness is able to verify or recognize the principal's identity and assess the 
28 principal's capacity.  The signature of the principal and the witness must physically appear 
29 on the same document but do not need to be on the same page.  The signature pages do not 
30 need to be in the same location as each other when they are signed, as long as all parties 
31 involved are clearly intending to complete a unified document by signing and the pages are 
32 promptly assembled as a complete document.  The written instrument must be able to be 
33 tracked with a reasonable degree of certainty as it travels between the principal and the 
34 witness or any notary to ensure it is not altered from the condition it is in when the principal 
35 signs it.  Any ambiguity with regard to effective execution presented by this subsection 
36 must be resolved in favor of permitting reasonable means of execution that allow an 
37 individual to memorialize that individual's instructions with regard to that individual's 
38 health care.
39Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
40 takes effect when approved.
