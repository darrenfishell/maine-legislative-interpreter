Page 1 - 130LR0474(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §17851, sub-§3-B is enacted to read:
33-B.  School administrator or teacher with creditable service of 35 years or more 
4in service at retirement.  A school administrator or teacher in service who has completed 
5 35 or more years of creditable service qualifies for a service retirement benefit if the 
6 member retires at any time after completing 35 years of service.
7Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §17852, sub-§3-C is enacted to read:
83-C.  School administrator or teacher with creditable service of 35 years or more 
9in service at retirement.  The amount of the service retirement benefit for a school 
10 administrator or teacher qualified under section 17851, subsection 3-B is computed in 
11 accordance with subsection 1, except that the benefit may not be reduced due to a member's 
12 age.
13Sec. 3.  5 MRSA §17859, sub-§3-A, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 436, §1, is amended 
14 to read:
153-A.  Contributions to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.  For a 
16 reemployed retired state employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator, the 
17 portion of the employer contribution that goes to pay the retirement system for the unfunded 
18 liability must be continued at the same contribution rate of the employer as described in 
19 section 17253 as is required for the position as if the position were filled by an employee 
20 who is not a retired state employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator.  For a 
21 reemployed retired teacher or retired school administrator who retired under section 17851, 
22 subsection 3-B, the retired teacher or retired school administrator must pay the employee 
23 contribution at the rate described in section 17701.  A retired state employee, retired teacher 
24 or retired school administrator who returns to service under this section is not a member 
25 and therefore may not accrue additional creditable service during the reemployment period 
26 or change the retired state employee's, retired teacher's or retired school administrator's 
27 earnable compensation for benefit calculation purposes.
28SUMMARY
29 This bill allows teachers and school administrators in service after 35 years of 
30 creditable service to retire and collect retirement benefits without penalty.  It also requires 
31 that a reemployed retired teacher or retired school administrator pay the same employee 
32 contribution rate to the retirement system as is required for the position if the position were 
33 filled by an employee who is not retired.
