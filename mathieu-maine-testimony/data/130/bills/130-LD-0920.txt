35 record local broadcast channels.  In addition, a cable system operator video service provider 
36 shall identify public, educational and governmental access channels on the electronic 
37 program guide in the same manner as that in which local broadcast channels are identified.  
38 This subsection does not obligate a cable system operator video service provider to list 
39 public, educational and governmental access channel content on channel cards and channel 
40 listings.  If channels are selected by a viewer through a menu system, the cable system 
41 operator video service provider shall display the public, educational and governmental 
42 access channels' designations in a similar manner as that in which local broadcast channel 
43 designations are displayed.

39SUMMARY
40 This bill amends the State's laws governing municipal cable television systems 
41 ordinances as follows.40
41
Page 12 - 130LR0463(01)1 1.  It adds definitions for the terms "facility support equipment"; "public, educational 
2 and governmental facility equipment"; "public, educational and governmental 
3 programming"; "public, educational and governmental signal"; and "video service 
4 provider."
5 2.  It amends those laws to clarify the regulation under those laws of video service 
6 providers, which included cable system operators.
7 3.  It removes language authorizing municipalities to enter into exclusive franchise 
8 agreements or contracts with a video service provider.
9 4.  It prohibits video service providers from providing services within a municipality 
10 unless the provider has entered into a franchise agreement or contract with that 
11 municipality.
12 5.  It requires video service providers to pay on a quarterly basis to each municipality 
13 with which it has a franchise agreement or contract a fee equal to 5% of the provider's gross 
14 annual revenue from its operations within the municipality.
15 6.  It clarifies that all costs associated with public, educational and governmental 
16 facility equipment used for the management of public, educational and governmental 
17 access channels within a franchising municipality, including technology upgrade costs for 
18 signal quality improvement, are the responsibility of the video service provider the 
19 municipality has granted a franchise to.  The video service provider may not offset such 
20 costs through the payment of required franchise fees.
21 7.  It authorizes the Public Utilities Commission to oversee and enforce provisions 
22 relating to the municipal franchising of video service providers.  Costs associated with that 
23 oversight and enforcement will be offset through the collection by video service providers 
24 from their subscribers of a video service regulatory surcharge, the amount of which will be 
25 established by the Public Utilities Commission by rule but which may not exceed 25¢ per 
26 month per subscriber.
27 8.  It authorizes the Attorney General to bring an enforcement action against a 
28 noncompliant video service provider in accordance with its authority under the Maine 
29 Unfair Trade Practices Act.  It also authorizes a municipality to bring a similar enforcement 
30 action.  Both types of actions must be brought within 7 years of the date the cause of action 
31 arose.
32 9.  It clarifies that the consumer protection provisions in law currently available to 
33 consumers with respect to cable television service apply to the services provided by video 
34 service providers.
35 10.  It excludes from otherwise applicable permitting requirements under the laws 
36 regulating facilities in the public way the provision of services by a video service provider 
37 that are instead regulated under the laws governing municipal cable television systems 
38 ordinances, as amended by this legislation.
39 11.  It establishes a dispute resolution process, to be overseen by the Public Utilities 
40 Commission, for disputes that arise between a franchising municipality and a video service 
41 provider over their respective obligations under a franchise contract or agreement.
