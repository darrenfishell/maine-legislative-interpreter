19 accordance with this subsection.  The commission may issue a certificate only if the 
20 petitioner has demonstrated that the petitioner agrees to provide a minimum benefit to 
21 ratepayers in the State of equal value to the ratepayer-funded physical assets used to 
22 construct the nonessential transmission line.  The commission shall by order establish the 
23 value of ratepayer-funded physical assets used to construct the nonessential transmission

33 and cost-effective manner and with consideration given to ratepayer benefits and 
34 greenhouse gas reduction goals.  In conducting the inquiry, the commission shall convene

40 report.
Page 2 - 130LR0836(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill establishes requirements for the approval of construction of nonessential 
3 transmission lines when the party seeking approval from the Public Utilities Commission 
4 is a transmission and distribution utility.  The bill defines "nonessential transmission line" 
5 as a transmission line that is not being constructed primarily for reliability purposes or to 
6 serve retail customers in the State and provides that a generator interconnection 
7 transmission facility is not a nonessential transmission line.  In addition to meeting the 
8 existing requirements in law for approval of a transmission line, a transmission and 
9 distribution utility petitioning for commission approval for a nonessential transmission line 
10 is required to demonstrate that the petitioner agrees to provide a minimum benefit to 
11 ratepayers in the State of equal value to the ratepayer-funded physical assets used to 
12 construct the nonessential transmission line.  The bill requires the Public Utilities 
13 Commission to conduct an inquiry to determine statutory or rule changes needed to ensure 
14 that nonessential transmission lines are built in the most competitive and cost-effective 
15 manner and with consideration given to ratepayer benefits and greenhouse gas reduction 
16 goals and to report the results of the inquiry to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
17 Utilities and Technology.
