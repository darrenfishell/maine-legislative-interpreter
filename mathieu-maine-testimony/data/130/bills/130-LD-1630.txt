15PROPORTIONAL FINES
16§1781.  Proportional fines
17 There is established a system of proportional fines to be based on the offense units for 
18 all criminal convictions and adjudications of civil violations under this Title.  Beginning 
19 January 1, 2023, in sentencing a person convicted of a crime or adjudicated of a civil 
20 violation under this Title for which an offense unit has been established by the Legislature, 
21 the court shall determine the fine by application of the system of proportional fines 
22 provided in this subchapter.
23§1782.  Definitions
24 For the purposes of this subchapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
25 following terms have the following meanings.
261.  Commission.  "Commission" means the Proportional Fine Commission established 
27 in Title 5, section 12004-J, subsection 11-A and whose duties are described in section 1783.
282.  Debt payment.  "Debt payment" means any payment, including other criminal 
29 justice debt, made to service or pay down debt or otherwise required by a debt instrument, 
30 during the 12 months prior to the date on which the proportional fine is ordered by the 
31 court, but not including mortgage payments.  "Debt payment" includes a debt on which a 
32 defendant has not paid or accrued liability during the preceding 12 months but on which 
33 the defendant will be required to make payments during the 12 months after the 
34 proportional fine is ordered.
353.  Deductions.  "Deductions" means any of the following adjustments to Maine 
36 adjusted gross income as defined in Title 36, section 5102, subsection 1-C:
37 A.  Any debt payments listed in a sworn affidavit or other comparable proof of debt 
38 payments;4

Page 2 - 130LR0968(01)1 B.  Self-support in an amount of 15% of after-tax income;
2 C.  Needs of a dependent spouse in the amount of 15% of after-tax income;
3 D.  Needs of nonspouse additional dependents in the amounts of 15% for the first 
4 dependent and 10% each for the 2nd and 3rd dependents and 5% for each additional 
5 dependent; and
6 E.  After applying all of the deductions under paragraphs A to D, the applicable 
7 deduction of: 60% of income below the federal nonfarm income poverty level as 
8 defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and revised annually in 
9 accordance with the United States Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, 
10 Section 673(2); 40% of income between the federal nonfarm income poverty level and 
11 200% of the nonfarm income poverty level; or 20% of income between the federal 
12 nonfarm income poverty level and 400% of the nonfarm income poverty level.
134.  Net income.  "Net income" means the self-reported, after-tax income of a defendant 
14 from all sources, minus deductions, supported by sworn affidavit for the one-year period 
15 prior to the date of the offense under this Title.  The court in its discretion may adjust net 
16 income reported by the defendant up or down, based on clear and convincing evidence that 
17 the defendant earned income of a different amount and may adjust net income to reflect a 
18 change in circumstances and to better represent the defendant's average income.  For a 
19 person with little or no income and income in an unascertainable amount, the court in its 
20 discretion may establish net income based on the amount of the defendant's self-reported 
21 benefits received in the prior 12 months, minus deductions, and any adjustment to those 
22 figures to more accurately represent the defendant's income.
235.  Offense unit.  "Offense unit" means the numerical value, which must be an integer 
24 between one and 120, that is assigned to each crime or civil violation.
256.  Proportional fine.  "Proportional fine" means the product of the offense unit and 
26 the quotient of the net income of the defendant divided by 365.

18 civil violations and the fines assigned to each crime or civil violation in effect on the 
19 effective date of this subchapter.  The commission shall assign an offense unit to each crime 
20 and civil violation.  The commission shall compile, analyze, publish and distribute to the 
21 public information related to the compilation of criminal and civil violations, the

40§1784.  Proportional fine system
41 Beginning January 1, 2023, the provisions of chapter 61 and this subchapter govern the 
42 procedures of the court in ordering payment of a fine for conviction of a crime or 
43 adjudication of a civil violation under this Title for which an offense unit has been 
44 established by the Legislature.
Page 4 - 130LR0968(01)11.  Calculation of fine amount; payment.  In calculating the amount of a fine, the 
2 court, in addition to the procedures required in chapter 61 and any other law, shall 
3 determine the proportional fine as provided in this subsection.
4 A.  The court shall require a defendant to file a statement of net income and deductions 
5 as provided in rules adopted by the court.
6 B.  If a defendant does not file a statement of net income and deductions as required in 
7 paragraph A or if the defendant deliberately misleads the court as to income or 
8 deductions and the defendant fails to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence 
9 why the defendant is unable to comply with the requirement to file the statement of net 
10 income and deductions, the court may order a fine up to the maximum fine for the 
11 crime or civil violation.
12 C.  Except as provided in this paragraph, the court shall determine the amount of the 
13 fine for a crime or civil violation by calculating the product of the offense unit and the 
14 quotient of the net income of the defendant divided by 365.  The court may, in its 
15 discretion and upon a finding stated in the record and documentation of the reasons for 
16 the deviation, order a deviation from the proportional fine required by this paragraph 
17 by varying the offense unit by no more than 10% from the offense unit assigned to the 
18 crime or civil violation.
19 D.  A defendant may apply to the court at any time to convert all or part of a fine to 
20 programmatic participation or community service hours by applying a credit of $20 per 
21 hour for hours of participation or service.  Programmatic participation or community 
22 service may be ordered only if it does not interfere with employment, travel restrictions 
23 or family care responsibilities.  The court may specify the type of programmatic 
24 participation or community service, including, but not limited to, substance use 
25 disorder treatment, mental health treatment, educational programs, job training and job 
26 readiness programs and appointments or coaching for the purposes of learning about 
27 and applying for housing, employment, health care, food assistance, general assistance 
28 and other benefits.
29 E.  If the court finds, based on the totality of circumstances, that the amount of the 
30 proportional fine would grossly exceed a defendant's ability to pay, the court may order 
31 a fine that is less than the proportional fine.
32 F.  If the court finds, based on the totality of circumstances, that the amount of a 
33 proportional fine would be disproportionate to the severity of an offense, the court may 
34 order a fine that is more than the proportional fine, subject to a limit of 10% above the 
35 amount of the proportional fine.
36 G.  The court may order payment of a fine in installment payments.  Unless the court 
37 makes a finding on the record to justify a fine that will take a defendant more than 24 
38 months to pay from the date of imposition of the fine or the date of release from prison 
39 or jail, the court may not order a fine to be paid in installment payments that extend 
40 beyond 24 months.  A defendant who is unable to make installment payments as 
41 ordered by the court may apply to the court for modification of the court order and may 
42 not be required to be present in court for the judge to consider and rule on the 
43 application for modification.
Page 5 - 130LR0968(01)1 H.  A person subject to an order of payment of a fine may not be required to be present 
2 in court to pay the fine.
3 I.  The court must accept payment of fines by mail, in person and through an electronic 
4 payment system without additional charge to the defendant because of the manner in 
5 which the fine is paid.
6 J.  The court shall credit all fines imposed pursuant to this subchapter and chapter 61 
7 to the General Fund.
8§1785.  Collection of data; staffing
9 The commission shall determine the data on crimes and fines needed for the 
10 performance of its work and shall request assistance to enable it to perform its duties.  The 
11 Office of the Attorney General shall provide arrest and summons data from law 
12 enforcement agencies statewide and the judicial branch shall provide data on crimes and 
13 fines as determined to be needed by the commission.  Except during any regular or special 
14 session of the Legislature, the Legislative Council shall provide staff as needed by the 
15 commission to assist the commission in performing its duties under this subchapter, 
16 including but not limited to compiling the list of crimes and civil violations under this Title 
17 and a list of offense units applicable to each crime or civil violation, and compiling, 
18 analyzing, publishing and distributing to the public data related to the performance by the 
19 commission of its duties and the imposition of proportional fine sentences by the court in 
20 accordance with this subchapter.
21§1786.  Rulemaking
22 The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subchapter.  Rules adopted 
23 pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, 
24 subchapter 2-A.
25Sec. 4.  Proportional Fine Commission review of fines for crimes and civil 
26violations in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A and assignment of offense 
27units.  By January 1, 2022, the Proportional Fine Commission pursuant to the Maine 
28 Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 65, subchapter 3 shall complete its review of all 
29 criminal and civil violations under Title 17-A and the fines assigned to each crime or civil 
30 violation on the effective date of this section and shall assign to each crime and civil 
31 violation an offense unit, as defined in Title 17-A, section 1782, subsection 5, to be used 
32 in determining the amount of the proportional fine for a crime or civil violation, as provided 
33 in Title 17-A, section 1784, subsection 1, paragraph C.  By February 1, 2022, the 
34 Proportional Fine Commission shall report to the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal 
35 Justice and Public Safety on the result of its work under this section and shall include 
36 legislation to be considered by the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature to 
37 amend Title 17-A to repeal fines in existence on the effective date of this Act and enact 
38 offense units into Title 17-A, chapter 65, subchapter 3.
39SUMMARY
40 This bill establishes the Proportional Fine Commission to begin the process of change 
41 from fines that are currently set in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A for crimes and 
42 civil violations to proportional fines set by determination of an offense unit for each crime 
43 and civil violation and established by the Legislature.  The bill requires that, by January 1, 40

Page 6 - 130LR0968(01)44 2022, the Proportional Fine Commission complete its review of all criminal and civil 
45 violations under Title 17-A and the fine currently assigned to each offense.  The bill 
46 requires the Proportional Fine Commission to assign to each crime and civil violation an 
47 offense unit to be used in determining the amount of the proportional fine.  By February 1, 
48 2022, the Proportional Fine Commission is required to report to the Joint Standing 
49 Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety on the result of its work, including 
50 legislation to be considered by the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature to 
51 amend Title 17-A to repeal fines set in statute and to enact offense units into Title 17-A as 
52 the foundation for the system of proportional fines.  The bill requires that the system of 
53 proportional fines take effect January 1, 2023.  Beginning January 1, 2023, the court is 
54 required to determine the amount of a fine by calculating the product of the offense unit 
55 and the quotient of the net income of the defendant divided by 365.1
