Page 1 - 130LR1149(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3145 is enacted to read:
3§3145.  State energy storage policy goals
4 The state goal for energy storage system development is 100 megawatts of installed 
5 capacity located within the State by December 31, 2025.  For the purposes of this section, 
6 "energy storage system" has the same meaning as in section 3481, subsection 6.
7Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §10102, sub-§5-A is enacted to read:
85-A.  Energy storage system.  "Energy storage system" has the same meaning as in 
9 section 3481, subsection 6.
10Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §10109, sub-§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 69, §1, is 
11 further amended to read:
12 A.  Trust funds must be allocated for measures, investments, loans, technical assistance 
13 and arrangements that reduce electricity consumption, increase energy efficiency or 
14 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs at commercial or industrial 
15 facilities and for investment in measures that lower residential heating energy demand 
16 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The measures that lower residential heating 
17 demand must be fuel-neutral and may include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency 
18 improvements to residential buildings, energy storage systems and upgrades to 
19 efficient heating systems that will reduce residential energy costs and greenhouse gas 
20 emissions, as determined by the board.  The trust shall ensure that measures to reduce 
21 the cost of residential heating are available for low-income households as defined by 
22 the trust.  When promoting electricity cost and consumption reduction, the trust may 
23 consider measures at commercial and industrial facilities that also lower peak capacity 
24 demand, including energy storage systems.  Subject to the apportionment pursuant to 
25 this subsection, the trust shall fund conservation programs that give priority to 
26 measures with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, as long as cost-effective collateral 
27 efficiency opportunities are not lost, and that:
28 (1)  Reliably reduce greenhouse gas production and heating energy costs by fossil 
29 fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit 
30 of emissions; or
31 (2)  Reliably increase the efficiency with which energy in the State is consumed at 
32 the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit of energy saved.
33Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 365, §3, is 
34 further amended by amending subparagraph (4) to read:
35 (4)  Reduce the price of electricity over time for all consumers by achieving 
36 reductions in demand for electricity during peak use periods, including by the 
37 implementation of beneficial electrification and energy storage systems; and
38Sec. 5.  Efficiency Maine Trust; energy storage measures.  The Efficiency 
39 Maine Trust shall explore and evaluate options to expand existing opportunities and 
40 develop new opportunities to support energy storage measures that reduce peak demand, 
41 through its electric efficiency and conservation programs established pursuant to the Maine 
42 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 10110 and its programs funded by the Regional 
Page 2 - 130LR1149(01)43 Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund established in Title 35-A, section 10109. In 
44 evaluating the cost-effectiveness of energy storage measures, the trust shall explore various 
45 methods and tests to measure cost-effectiveness.  In fulfilling the duties of this section, the 
46 trust shall consider:
5 1.  Expanding energy storage pilot projects within the trust's innovation pilot program 
6 and implementing any cost-effective pilot projects as statewide programs;
7 2.  Bring-your-own-device programs in which customer-owned and customer-sited 
8 battery storage is aggregated and performance incentives are provided for reducing load at 
9 times of system peak;
10 3.  Rebate or funding programs for energy storage paired with renewable energy for 
11 residential, commercial and industrial electricity customers; and
12 4.  Customer education initiatives regarding demand management and energy storage, 
13 including education targeted to low-income and rural populations in the State.
14 The trust shall report on its activities under this section, including its efforts with 
15 respect to bring-your-own-device programs, in the trust's annual report due December 1, 
16 2021 pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 10104, subsection 5.
17Sec. 6.  Public Utilities Commission; rate design and energy storage.  The 
18 Public Utilities Commission shall investigate and, where appropriate, implement 
19 transmission and distribution utility rate designs that account for variation in the cost 
20 components of electricity as the load or demand on the electricity system fluctuates. The 
21 commission shall take the following specific steps to address rate design and energy 
22 storage:
23 1.  Open a docket to investigate opportunities to modernize transmission and 
24 distribution utility rate designs through time-of-use or other time-differentiated rates that 
25 send appropriate price signals and incentives to consumers to reduce demand during peak 
26 periods and develop and implement a pilot program to test and evaluate time-of-use rates 
27 in conjunction with energy storage; and
28 2.  Develop and implement a schedule for regular review and update of transmission 
29 and distribution utility rate designs, including consideration of fixed charges, and ensure 
30 that the review includes consideration of time-differentiated rates.
31SUMMARY
32 This bill:
33 1.  Establishes a state goal for energy storage system development of 100 megawatts 
34 of installed capacity located within the State by December 31, 2025;
35 2.  Amends the laws governing the Efficiency Maine Trust to ensure that the trust's 
36 authority explicitly and affirmatively includes energy storage by adding direct references 
37 to energy storage in relevant sections of statute; directs the trust to consider expanding 
38 opportunities to use energy storage to reduce peak electricity demand; and directs the trust 
39 to explore alternative methods to demonstrate cost-effectiveness for energy storage projects 
40 or programs; and
41 3.  Directs the Public Utilities Commission to investigate opportunities to modernize 
42 transmission and distribution utility rate designs through time-of-use or other time-1
