Page 1 - 130LR0283(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §1202-A, sub-§2, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 198, §17, is 
3 amended to read:
4 A.  A journeyman electrician may make electrical installations while employed by a

6 licensed under this subsection may supervise:
7 ( 1)  Two helper electricians who are enrolled in, or have completed, a program of 
8 study consisting of 576 hours of education as approved by the board or from an 
9 accredited institution;
10 (2)  Two apprentice electricians; or
11 (3)  One Three helper electrician  electricians.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill changes the number of helper electricians who may be supervised by a 
14 journeyman electrician.  Under current law, a journeyman electrician may supervise one 
15 helper electrician or 2 helper electricians if they are enrolled in or have completed a certain 
16 educational program.  This bill eliminates this distinction and allows a journeyman 
17 electrician to supervise 3 helper electricians.
