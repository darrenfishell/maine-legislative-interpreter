Page 1 - 130LR2057(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law requires that a municipality hold a referendum to authorize or 
4 the county commissioners of an unincorporated place approve the sale of liquor in that 
5 municipality or unincorporated place; and
6Whereas, based upon the affirmative referendum or county commissioner 
7 authorization, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
8 Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations is authorized to issue a liquor license to a 
9 qualified establishment in that municipality or unincorporated place; and
10Whereas, it recently became clear that a large number of municipalities would have 
11 to conduct new local option elections and county commissioners would have to reauthorize 
12 the sale of liquor due to changes in terminology that occurred in 1976 relating to types of 
13 establishments requiring liquor licenses; and
14Whereas, Public Law 2019, chapter 672, enacted by the Legislature and approved by 
15 the Governor on March 18, 2020, authorized the bureau to continue to issue, renew or 
16 transfer licenses to sell liquor in an authorized municipality or authorized unincorporated 
17 place until July 1, 2022, by which date municipalities and unincorporated places would be 
18 required to provide evidence of the results of a local option election or county 
19 commissioner action authorizing such sales; and
20Whereas, conducting local option elections to affirm that the pre-1976 local option 
21 vote should be extended to all establishment types constitutes a significant financial and 
22 administrative burden for many municipalities and unincorporated places statewide; and
23Whereas, it is imperative that this legislation take effect as soon as possible to avoid 
24 irreparable harm to businesses that have complied with all requirements but could lose their 
25 licenses to sell liquor for reasons beyond their control, while providing an alternative option 
26 to municipalities and unincorporated places to allow municipal officers or the county 
27 commissioners of an unincorporated place the option to affirm and extend the results of a 
28 past local option election or county commissioner authorization to new license 
29 classifications created by changes to laws in effect at the time of previous local option 
30 elections or county commissioner authorizations instead of requiring additional local 
31 option elections in potentially hundreds of municipalities or unincorporated places to 
32 address the ramifications of Public Law 2019, chapter 672; and
33Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
34 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
35 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
36 therefore,
37Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
38Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA §121, sub-§1-A, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 672, §2, is 
39 amended to read:
401-A.  Vote of municipal officers.  As an alternative to the petition process in 
41 subsection 1, the municipal officers may vote either to hold a local option election, which 
42 must be conducted pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph A, including one or more of the 
Page 2 - 130LR2057(01)43 questions specified in section 123, or to affirm the scope of a prior local option election 
44 under the procedure established in section 125, subsection 3, paragraph B.
3Sec. 2.  28-A MRSA §125, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 672, §4, is repealed 
4 and the following enacted in its place:
53.  Proof of municipal local option election or county commissioner authorization.  
6 If a municipality or unincorporated place disagrees with a preliminary determination made 
7 by the bureau under subsection 2, by July 1, 2022:
8 A.  The municipality may submit evidence of the results of an election on any local 
9 option question pursuant to section 123 or former Title 28, section 101 or the county 
10 commissioners of an unincorporated place may submit evidence of the result of an 
11 affirmative decision pursuant to section 122 or former Title 28, section 103 to refute 
12 the bureau's preliminary determination; or
13 B.  The municipal officers may vote to affirm that the results of a local option election 
14 of a question approved by voters that specified certain types of licensed establishments 
15 as required by former Title 28, section 101 are considered an approval for all types of 
16 establishments that may be licensed by the bureau.  The county commissioners of an 
17 unincorporated place may vote to affirm that a prior authorization for certain types of 
18 licensed establishments under former Title 28, section 103 is considered an approval 
19 for all types of establishments that may be licensed by the bureau.  The municipality 
20 or unincorporated place shall submit evidence of such municipal officers' or county 
21 commissioners' vote, which must be accepted by the bureau to refute the bureau's 
22 preliminary determination. 
23 Nothing in this subsection prohibits a municipality from conducting a local option election 
24 in accordance with this chapter at any time.
25Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
26 takes effect when approved.
27SUMMARY
28 Current law requires a municipality through a local option election to affirmatively 
29 authorize the licensing of businesses to sell liquor in that municipality.  In an 
30 unincorporated place, the county commissioners must decide whether to authorize or not 
31 authorize the licensing of businesses to sell liquor in that unincorporated place.  Based on 
32 the type of sales authorized in that municipality or unincorporated place, the Department 
33 of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
34 Operations issues licenses to the establishments or agency liquor stores in that municipality 
35 or unincorporated place.
36 Since a municipality or unincorporated place may not be able to provide proof that the 
37 sale of liquor was authorized in that municipality or unincorporated place, Public Law 
38 2019, chapter 672 was enacted to provide a window, until July 1, 2022, for a municipality 
39 or unincorporated place to either provide the bureau with proof of an affirmative vote or 
40 decision or to conduct a new local option election or affirmative decision by the county 
41 commissioners to authorize the sale of liquor.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, 
42 many municipalities were unable to conduct the new local option election required to affirm 
43 the authorization of the sale of liquor.1

Page 3 - 130LR2057(01)1 This bill allows a municipality to authorize the sale of liquor by allowing the municipal 
2 officers to vote to affirm the results of a prior local option election held for that purpose 
3 and it allows the county commissioners of an unincorporated place to reaffirm a prior 
4 authorization.  This bill specifies that such authorization constitutes proof for purposes of 
5 approving the sale of liquor by all types of establishments that may be licensed by the 
6 bureau in that municipality or unincorporated place.
