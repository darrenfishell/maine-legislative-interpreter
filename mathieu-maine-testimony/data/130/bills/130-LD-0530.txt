6 amount of any copayment, coinsurance or deductible due under the terms of a health plan 
7 owed by an enrollee, or the party responsible for making payments on an enrollee's behalf,

9 services provided to an enrollee for each episode of care.

11 guidelines and make information about the guidelines available to each enrollee, including

19 to a provider.
204.  No discontinuance of coverage.  A carrier may not discontinue coverage for an 
21 enrollee under a health plan based on an enrollee's failure to pay the amount of any 
22 copayment, coinsurance or deductible as required under the terms of a health plan.
235.  Reimbursement of provider.  A carrier that is obligated under the terms of a health 
24 plan to pay for health care services rendered to an enrollee shall reimburse the provider

26 including any copayment, coinsurance or deductible payable by an enrollee under the terms 
27 of the plan.
286.  No delay in payment.  A carrier may not withhold or otherwise delay payment to
