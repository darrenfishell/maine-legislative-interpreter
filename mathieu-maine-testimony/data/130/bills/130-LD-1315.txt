27SUMMARY
28 This bill declares that the transport, storage, sale and transfer of and other activities 
29 involving firearms, ammunition and components and accessories are considered essential 
30 businesses and services during a state of emergency declared by the Governor and prohibits 
31 the regulation, curtailment, seizure or other actions to restrict otherwise lawfully owned 
32 and possessed firearms, ammunition and related components and accessories and related 
33 activities during a state of emergency.  This bill exempts from the provisions a law 
34 enforcement officer's seizing a firearm, ammunition or accessories or components while 
35 detaining an individual for suspected criminal activity pursuant to a warrantless arrest.  This 
36 bill also suspends the expiration date for concealed handgun permits for a state of 
37 emergency.
