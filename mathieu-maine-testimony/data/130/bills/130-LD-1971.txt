3 amended to read:
4 A.  After notice and hearing the body has adopted a written policy governing the 
5 conditions upon which members of the body and the public may participate in a public 
6 proceeding of that body by remote methods; .
7 (1)  If a public body has not adopted a policy authorizing remote methods of

16 (2)  If the members vote in support of the chair's determination under subparagraph 
17 (1), after an opportunity for hearing, the members may vote on whether to adopt a

19 body under this section;
20SUMMARY
21 This bill implements the recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 
22 concerning remote participation by members of a public body subject to the Freedom of 
23 Access Act.
24 Current law does not authorize members of a public body to participate in a public 
25 proceeding when not physically present unless the public body has properly adopted a 
26 remote participation policy that meets the requirement of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
27 1, section 403-B.
28 This bill authorizes a public body to adopt the required remote participation policy 
29 through remote participation.  The bill provides a 2-step process.
30 1.  If the chair of the public body determines that an emergency or urgent issue exists 
31 that prevents the public body from meeting in person, the chair may call a meeting of the 
32 public body in which the members may participate by remote methods.  Public notice of 
33 the meeting must be provided and must include information about how the public can 
34 participate in the meeting.  Once the meeting is convened, the members must vote on 
35 whether to support the chair's determination that an emergency or urgent issue exists that 
36 prevents the public body from meeting in person.
37 2.  If the members vote in support of the chair's determination, after an opportunity for 
38 hearing, the members may vote on adopting a policy authorizing remote participation.21
