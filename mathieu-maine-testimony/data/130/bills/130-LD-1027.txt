Page 1 - 130LR0453(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §563, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2, is amended to 
3 read:
41.  Municipal-maintained structures.  For a structure for which a municipality has 
5 maintenance responsibility, the department shall advise the municipality of its inspection 
6 findings,  and noted deficiencies  and recommendations regarding posting or closure.  The 
7 municipality has sole responsibility and authority to determine whether a structure must be 
8 posted or closed, except that the department may close the structure in cases of emergency 
9 or when the department reasonably determines closure is necessary to protect the traveling 
10 public from imminent hazard.  If the department becomes aware of deficiencies in a 
11 structure that could impact posting or closure decisions, the department shall promptly 
12 notify the municipality.   The department shall notify the municipality when a structure 
13 requires a posting or closure, and the municipality shall post or close the structure.  The 
14 department may post or close a structure to protect the traveling public from an imminent 
15 hazard.  The municipality is responsible for all costs and expenses related to the posting 
16 and closure, including any needed notifications, procedures, signing and barricades.
17Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §566, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2, is amended to 
18 read:
191.  Changes to structures.  If a structure is improved in a manner that affects whether 
20 it is defined as  changes a culvert or a minor span or to a bridge, the responsibilities set forth 
21 in this subchapter regarding the structure do not change unless the department determines 
22 that there exists a reasonable engineering basis for the improvement and the department 
23 approves the design plans and specifications of the improvement prior to the construction.  
24 The department may approve improvements to a structure only if the improvements are 
25 made in accordance with department standards and sealed by a professional engineer 
26 licensed under Title 32, chapter 19.  After construction, the department shall inspect the 
27 structure and, if the structure is found to conform with the approved design, the department 
28 shall accept responsibility for the structure.  If the inspection reveals the structure was not 
29 improved in accordance with the department-approved design, the municipality shall make 
30 any necessary corrections to the structure required by the department before the department 
31 accepts responsibility for the structure.
32Sec. 3.  23 MRSA §566, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2, is amended to 
33 read:
342.  New structures.  If a municipality constructs a new bridge on a town way, the 
35 department shall assume the responsibilities set forth in the this subchapter only if the 
36 department determines that there is a reasonable engineering basis for the bridge, as 
37 opposed to a minor span, and if the department approves the design and construction of the 
38 bridge prior to the construction of the bridge.  The department may approve the design and 
39 construction of a bridge only if the bridge is designed in accordance with department 
40 standards and sealed by a professional engineer licensed under Title 32, chapter 19.  After 
41 construction, the department shall inspect the bridge. If the inspection reveals the bridge 
42 was not constructed in accordance with the department-approved design, the municipality 
43 shall make any necessary corrections to the bridge required by the department before the 
44 department accepts responsibility for the bridge.
Page 2 - 130LR0453(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill requires the Department of Transportation to notify a municipality when a 
3 bridge for which a municipality has maintenance responsibility requires a posting or 
4 closure and requires the municipality to carry out the posting or closure; current law 
5 provides a municipality sole responsibility to determine whether such a bridge must be 
6 posted or closed.  The bill provides that in order for the department to accept certain 
7 responsibilities for an improved bridge or for a new bridge, the department must approve 
8 the design of the improvements or construction before the improvements are made or the 
9 bridge is constructed.  The design of the improvements or construction must meet standards 
10 set by the department and be sealed by a professional engineer.  The department must 
11 inspect the bridge after it is improved or constructed.2
