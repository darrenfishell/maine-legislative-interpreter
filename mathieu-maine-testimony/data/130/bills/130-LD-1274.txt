Page 1 - 130LR0954(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus referred to as COVID-19 has created a 
4 public health emergency; and
5Whereas, in response to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has declared a 
6 pandemic, the President of the United States has declared a national emergency and the 
7 Governor of Maine has declared a civil state of emergency; and
8Whereas, state and federal authorities, including the federal Centers for Disease 
9 Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, Maine Center for 
10 Disease Control and Prevention and the Governor have recommended or placed limits on 
11 public gatherings; and
12Whereas, the most recommended ways of avoiding infection and furthering the 
13 spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 are for authorities to reduce the number of public 
14 gatherings and for people to avoid large crowds; and
15Whereas, municipal leaders seek to ensure public safety by acting in concert with 
16 public health guidelines to discourage large gatherings and also recognize the likelihood of 
17 low voter turnout at meetings or elections held, depriving voters of full participation in 
18 municipal decisions; and
19Whereas, there is no procedure in Maine law to postpone a municipal secret ballot 
20 election or nomination process already in progress, and delay of municipal budget meetings 
21 will deprive municipal authorities of legal authority to spend and continue operations; and
22Whereas, it is imperative that action be taken at the earliest possible moment to allow 
23 for continuity of services by municipalities despite the need to postpone meetings; and
24Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
25 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
26 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
27 therefore,
28Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
29Sec. 1.  Failure to pass municipal budget; deemed approved; tax 
30commitment.  Notwithstanding any law or municipal charter provision to the contrary, if 
31 an annual municipal budget meeting is delayed beyond the date the annual budget is 
32 customarily submitted to the legislative body of that municipality for approval due to public 
33 health concerns arising from coronavirus disease 2019, referred to in this Act as 
34 COVID-19, the prior year's approved or deemed approved municipal budget is deemed the 
35 budget for the ensuing year until a final budget is approved.  If a final budget is not 
36 approved in a timely manner and the municipal officers determine that property taxes must 
37 be committed in a timely manner to the tax collector pursuant to the Maine Revised 
38 Statutes, Title 36, section 709, the municipal assessor may commit property taxes on the 
39 basis of the municipal budget deemed approved under this section.
40Sec. 2.  Individual authorization of disbursements by municipal treasurer.  
41 Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 5603, subsection 2, 
42 paragraph A or any other law or municipal charter provision or ordinance to the contrary, 
Page 2 - 130LR0954(01)43 for the duration of a state of emergency declared by the Governor in accordance with Title 
44 37-B, section 742 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and for 30 days following the 
45 termination of that state of emergency, a municipal treasurer may disburse money on the 
46 authority of a warrant drawn for that purpose seen and signed individually by a majority of 
47 the municipal officers outside of a public meeting.
6Sec. 3.  Postponement of secret ballot election.  Notwithstanding any law or 
7 municipal charter provision or ordinance to the contrary, during calendar year 2021, the 
8 municipal officers may postpone the date of a scheduled municipal secret ballot election 
9 when nomination papers have already been issued or filed by posting notice in a 
10 conspicuous public location at least 2 days prior to the date of the election. The notice must 
11 be signed by a majority of the municipal officers and must either:
12 1.  State a specific date and time during which the polls will be open to complete the 
13 election; or
14 2.  State that the date of a rescheduled election will be determined by the municipal 
15 officers.
16 The rescheduled election must be noticed by a warrant calling the election that is 
17 approved and posted pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 2523 at 
18 least 7 days prior to the date of the rescheduled election.
19 If ballots have been printed for the postponed election, the municipality may use those 
20 ballots despite inclusion of the original election date. If absentee ballots have been issued 
21 and returned, the municipality shall use the ballots printed for the originally scheduled 
22 election. The municipal clerk shall safeguard and secure any absentee ballots already 
23 returned until the date of the rescheduled election and shall process them as required by the 
24 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A. During the interim period between the originally 
25 scheduled election and rescheduled election, the clerk may continue to issue and accept 
26 absentee ballots and applications and allow voting in the presence of the clerk pursuant to 
27 Title 21-A.
28 A municipal secret ballot referendum election is subject to the same rescheduling, 
29 ballot and absentee ballot provisions as set forth in this section.
30Sec. 4.  Referendum vote hearing requirement.  The hearing required by the 
31 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 2528, subsection 5 or municipal charter before 
32 a referendum vote may be conducted via remote means following the requirements 
33 established for remote board meetings in Public Law 2019, chapter 617, Part G.
34Sec. 5.  Secret ballot election.  Notwithstanding any law or municipal charter 
35 provision to the contrary, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 2528, subsection 
36 1 is suspended to allow the municipal officers of a municipality that has not voted to accept 
37 secret ballot voting to nevertheless do so during the state of emergency declared by the 
38 Governor in accordance with Title 37-B, section 742 due to the outbreak of COVID-19.  
39 Elected officials in those municipalities may remain in office until an election pursuant to 
40 Title 30-A, section 2525.
41Sec. 6.  Referendum wording deadline.  The requirement in the Maine Revised 
42 Statutes, Title 30-A, section 2528, subsections 4 and 5 that municipal officers file with the 
43 clerk an order establishing the wording of a referendum question by the 60th day before a 1

4 Statutes, Title 30-A, section 5721-A, subsection 7, paragraph A requires a written ballot to 
5 exceed or increase the property tax levy limit at an open town meeting held in compliance
