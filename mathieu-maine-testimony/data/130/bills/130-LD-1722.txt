Page 1 - 130LR1450(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the substance use crisis, driven significantly by opioids, has killed 
4 thousands of Maine residents, including 380 individuals who died of drug overdoses in 
5 2019 alone, and devastated families and communities across the State; and
6Whereas, the Maine Attorney General has filed lawsuits against companies involved 
7 in opioid drug production, including opioid manufacturers and distributors, designed to 
8 hold them responsible for lives lost and provide resources to remediate harm caused by 
9 their products; and
10Whereas, funds derived from settlement of or damages granted in these lawsuits are 
11 anticipated to begin being distributed within the biennium, and it is imperative for public 
12 health and safety that all money received by the State as a result of lawsuits related to opioid 
13 manufacturers and distributors immediately be used to help remediate and abate the opioid 
14 and substance use crisis, by supporting all paths to recovery through opioid use prevention, 
15 intervention, treatment and recovery services, including the use of all United States Food 
16 and Drug Administration approved opioid addiction medications and expanded access to 
17 detoxification, relapse prevention, patient assessment, individual treatment planning, 
18 counseling, services for co-occurring mental illness, provider education, recovery supports, 
19 diversion control, adequate reimbursement rates and other best practices; and
20Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
