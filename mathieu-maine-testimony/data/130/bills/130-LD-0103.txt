15SUMMARY
16 This bill amends the laws pertaining to agriculture and animals to allow the 
17 Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to employ any person considered 
18 necessary to assist in any response to a natural or man-made disaster affecting animals both 
19 in the State and outside the State and provides for such a person's compensation.  It also 
20 establishes reporting requirements regarding such a disaster response.  It allows the Animal 
21 Welfare Advisory Council to have as a member a person who is a pet food supplier and an 
22 attorney with experience in the state court system.  It changes the rabies vaccination 
23 requirement to provide that an owner or keeper of a dog over 3 months of age must have 
24 the dog vaccinated.  It adds dangerous dogs and nuisance dogs to those animals that are 
25 excluded from obtaining dog licenses through the Internet licensing project.  It provides for 
26 the revocation of animal control officer certification if the officer refuses or intentionally 
27 fails to perform the officer's statutory duties.  It amends animal welfare laws to define 
28 "animal care facility" and to provide that the definition of "boarding kennel" applies to all 
29 privately owned animals that are kept for a fee.
