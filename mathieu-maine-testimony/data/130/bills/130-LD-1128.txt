15SUMMARY
16 This bill does the following.
17 Part A authorizes transport officers to transport prisoners to and from court pursuant to 
18 a writ of habeas corpus and to provide safe and secure custody of prisoners during the 
19 proceedings, as directed by the court.  Part A allows a transport officer to use a reasonable 
20 degree of nondeadly force and deadly force, based on the provisions applicable to law 
21 enforcement officers.  Part A clarifies the power of corrections personnel to use force by 
22 eliminating the current law's cross-reference to law enforcement officers' use of force when
