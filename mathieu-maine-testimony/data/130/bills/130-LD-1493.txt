Page 1 - 130LR1893(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the State is currently in a prolonged state of emergency where a global 
4 pandemic has decimated certain industries such as the seasonal and tourism sectors; and
5Whereas, the health of these affected industries is crucial as they are major industries 
6 in the State, contributing substantially to the State's economy and representing tens of 
7 thousands of jobs; and
8Whereas, with the state of emergency having now surpassed one year, many of these 
9 industries were not able to operate profitably, if at all, in the year 2020 and are unable 
10 financially to wait until the economy recovers and may fail or go out of business in the near 
11 future, especially if the adverse effects of the pandemic last throughout the remainder of 
12 this year; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16 therefore, be it

18and administer a fund to provide seasonal and tourism industry recovery

9 year 2020 as compared with gross sales reported to Maine Revenue Services in calendar 
10 year 2019.  For a business not in operation in calendar year 2019, the amount of the grant 
11 must be determined based upon the average loss of revenue and profits for a business of 
12 similar activity, licensing and gross sales.  The amount calculated under this section must 
13 be reduced by the amount of any grant or forgiven government recovery or stimulus 
14 assistance loan received by the business subsequent to March 1, 2020.  Funds received 
15 under the program are reportable income for tax filing purposes and are subject to audit.  
16 The State shall issue a statement of miscellaneous income to a grant recipient to be included

22 takes effect when approved.
23SUMMARY
