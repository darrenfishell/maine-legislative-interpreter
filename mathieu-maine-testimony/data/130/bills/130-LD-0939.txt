9 This bill makes the following changes to the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act.
10 1. It allows caregivers to employ assistants who are 18 years of age or older and under

13 manufacturing facilities must otherwise be 21 years of age or older.
14 2. It allows registered caregivers and dispensaries to transfer to and accept from another 
15 registered caregiver or a dispensary an unlimited amount of their marijuana plants and 
16 harvested marijuana in a wholesale transaction.
17 3. It allows caregivers to accept a digital image of a written certification for the
