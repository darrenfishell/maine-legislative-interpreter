Page 1 - 130LR0398(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §2159-C, as amended by PL 2019, c. 208, §1, is repealed.
3Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2159-F is enacted to read:
4§2159-F.  Genetic information for insurance purposes
51.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
6 following terms have the following meanings.
7 A.  "Genetic information" means information derived from genetic testing of an 
8 individual's genetic material or genes to determine the presence or absence of variations 
9 or mutations, including carrier status, that are scientifically or medically determined to 
10 cause a disease, disorder or syndrome, or that are associated with a statistically 
11 increased risk of developing a disease, disorder or syndrome, that is asymptomatic at 
12 the time of testing. Such genetic testing does not include routine physical examinations 
13 or chemical, blood or urine analysis, unless conducted purposefully to obtain genetic 
14 information or answer questions regarding family history.
15 B.  "Health insurer" means an insurer, nonprofit hospital or medical service 
16 organization or health maintenance organization that issues individual or group 
17 hospital, health or dental insurance.
18 C.  "Life insurer" means an insurer that issues life, credit life, disability, accidental 
19 injury, specified disease, hospital indemnity or credit accident insurance or annuities.
20 D.  "Long-term care insurer" means an insurer that issues long-term care insurance.
212.  Use of genetic information.  This subsection governs the use of genetic 
22 information.
23 A.  In the absence of a medical diagnosis of a disease, disorder or syndrome related to 
24 genetic information, a health insurer, life insurer or long-term care insurer may not 
25 cancel, limit or deny coverage or establish differentials in premium rates based on such 
26 genetic information.
27 B.  A health insurer, life insurer or long-term care insurer may not request, require, 
28 purchase or otherwise solicit genetic information, use genetic test results or consider 
29 an individual's decisions or actions relating to genetic testing in any manner for any 
30 insurance purpose.
313.  Application; construction.  This section applies to policies executed, delivered, 
32 issued for delivery, continued or renewed on or after January 1, 2022.  This section may 
33 not be construed as preventing a life insurer or long-term care insurer from accessing an 
34 individual's medical record as part of an application examination. This section does not 
35 prohibit a life insurer or long-term care insurer from considering a medical diagnosis 
36 included in an individual's medical record, even if a diagnosis was made based on the 
37 results of a genetic test.
38Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §6981, sub-§9, ¶H, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 447, §11, is 
39 amended to read:
Page 2 - 130LR0398(01)1 H.  The provisions of sections section 2159-B and 2159-C relating to discrimination 
2 against victims of domestic abuse and discrimination on the basis of genetic 
3 information or testing  and section 2159-F relating to the use of genetic information.
4Sec. 4.  Effective date. This Act takes effect January 1, 2022.
5SUMMARY
6 This bill repeals current law prohibiting discrimination by insurers on the basis of 
7 genetic information or testing and enacts a provision prohibiting, after January 1, 2022, 
8 insurers that issue individual or group hospital, health or dental insurance or life, credit life, 
9 disability, long-term care, accidental injury, specified disease, hospital indemnity or credit 
10 accident insurance or annuities from canceling, limiting or denying coverage or 
11 establishing differentials in premium rates based on genetic information under certain 
12 circumstances and prohibiting such insurers from requesting, requiring, purchasing or 
13 otherwise soliciting genetic information, using genetic test results or considering a person's 
14 decisions or actions relating to genetic testing in any manner for any insurance purpose.6
