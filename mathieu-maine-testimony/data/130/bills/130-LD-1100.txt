5 1, paragraph E, using solar power to investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities, 
6 as defined in section 3201, subsection 11-A, in a manner that supports the goals in this 
7 section and ensures:
8 A.  The State's interconnection rules reflect nationally recognized best practices;
9 B.  Customers affected by deficiencies in the rules are able to access timely resolution 
10 processes that do not place an undue burden on the customer; and
11 C.  Investments in investor-owned transmission and distribution utility distribution 
12 upgrades related to load are coordinated with utility infrastructure upgrades required 
13 for the interconnection of renewable capacity resources using solar power.
14Sec. 2.  Solar energy resources interconnection evaluation.  The Public 
15 Utilities Commission shall contract with an expert to evaluate near-term reforms to the 
16 State's standards, practices and procedures related to the interconnection of renewable 
17 capacity resources as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-C, 
18 subsection 1, paragraph E using solar power to investor-owned transmission and 
19 distribution utilities to:
20 1.  Ensure that the costs and requirements for an interconnection study do not unduly 
21 limit the ability of residential and nonresidential customers to install on-site solar energy 
22 generation and battery storage systems; and
23 2.  Improve the transparency of interconnection screens and upgrades for customer-
24 sited generation.
25 Within 6 months of the effective date of this Act, the commission shall conduct a 
26 proceeding and issue an order relating to the near-term reforms identified in the evaluation 
27 conducted under this section.  Within one year of the effective date of this Act, the 
28 commission shall determine and adopt cost allocation methods for interconnection studies 
29 and upgrades that ensure on-site solar energy generators do not bear prohibitive costs for 
30 their projects to be studied by investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities and to 
31 be interconnected to the State's distribution system.
32SUMMARY
33 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules related to the 
34 interconnection of renewable capacity resources using solar power to investor-owned 
35 transmission and distribution utilities in a manner that supports the goals in the Maine 
36 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3474.  It also directs the commission to contract with
