3 amended to read:
4 B.  "Long-term energy contract" means a contract with an investor-owned transmission 
5 and distribution utility entered into under section 3210‑C, 3210-H or section 3604.
6Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3210-H is enacted to read:
7§3210-H.  Long-term contracts
8 The commission shall direct investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to 
9 enter into contracts for distributed resources pursuant to this section.  For purposes of this 
10 section, "distributed resource" means an electric generating facility that uses a renewable 
11 fuel or technology under section 3210, subsection 2, paragraph B-3, regardless of the 
12 facility's power production capacity, and is located in the service territory of a transmission 
13 and distribution utility in the State.
141.  Solicitations.  By January 1, 2025, the commission shall select at least 2 competitive 
15 solicitations timed to coordinate with other procurements undertaken by the commission. 
16 Following a review of the bids received, the commission may negotiate with one or more 
17 potential suppliers of distributed resources.  If only one bid is offered, the commission shall 
18 ensure that the negotiation with the bidder is based on a full project cost disclosure by the 
19 potential supplier.  The commissioner shall negotiate a contract of up to 100 megawatts in 
20 capacity that is commercially reasonable and commits all parties to commercially 
21 reasonable behavior.  The commission may direct an investor-owned transmission and 
22 distribution utility to enter into a contract of up to 375 megawatts if the aggregate of 
23 projected costs of all contracts entered into under this section does not exceed the 
24 commission's most recent best estimate of the aggregate of costs of long-term contracts 
25 under section 3210-G.  If the pricing of one or more competitive bids is equivalent, the 
26 commission shall give preference to a project that:
27 A.  Supports the rural economy of the State;
28 B.  Offers a solution to the needs of the electric grid; or
29 C.  Includes a program to assist low-income residents of the State to obtain the benefits 
30 of renewable energy.
312.  Disposition of resources.  As directed by the commission pursuant to this section, 
32 an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility shall sell distributed resource 
33 capacity or energy purchased or take other action relative to distributed resource capacity 
34 or energy.
353.  Cost and benefit recovery.  The commission shall ensure that all costs and direct 
36 financial benefits associated with a contract entered into under this section are allocated to 
37 ratepayers in accordance with section 3210-F.  An amount charged to a ratepayer must 
38 reflect any price differential that exists at any time during the term of the contract between 
39 the contract price and the prevailing market price at which the distributed resource is sold 
40 and any other differences from gains or losses derived from a contract.
41Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA c. 34-C, as amended, is repealed.
Page 2 - 130LR1649(01)1SUMMARY
