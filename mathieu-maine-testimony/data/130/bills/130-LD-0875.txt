20 provide equal opportunity for any person protected by the Maine Human Rights 
21 Act.
22 B. The Attorney General may bring a civil action for equitable relief in Superior Court

36 the services to be privatized.  For purposes of this paragraph, "adequate resources" 
37 means no less than the minimum level of assistance provided for in:
38 (1) The terms of the existing collective bargaining agreement covering the agency 
39 employees seeking to submit a bid;

97. Review of bids; designation of winning bidder.  After soliciting and receiving the 
10 submitted bids, an agency shall: 
11 A. Publicly designate the bidder to which the agency proposes to award a privatization 
12 contract;

14 commissioner and the Attorney General.  If the proposed bidder under paragraph A 
15 proposes to perform any or all of the contract outside the boundaries of the State, the 
16 contract cost must be increased by the amount of any lost income tax revenue to the 
17 State caused by the corresponding elimination of agency employees, as determined by 
18 the State Tax Assessor; and
19 C. Determine whether the contract cost under paragraph B is less than the agency cost 
20 estimate prepared pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph C.  If the contract cost is equal 
21 to or more than the agency cost estimate, the agency may not enter into a privatization 
22 contract.
23 If a bid is received from an employee organization, the commissioner, or the 
24 commissioner's designee, may include staff from the Department of Administrative and 
25 Financial Services, Bureau of Human Resources in the bid review process authorized by 
26 section 1825-D.
278. Negotiation of privatization contract.  If the contract cost calculated pursuant to 
28 subsection 7, paragraph B is less than the agency cost estimate, the agency may begin 
29 negotiating the terms of the privatization contract except that, if an employee organization 
30 bid is awarded the privatization contract pursuant to subsection 7, the Department of 
31 Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Human Resources shall negotiate the 
32 terms of the privatization contract with the employee organization. If the contract cost is 
33 equal to or more than the agency cost estimate, the agency may not enter into a privatization 
34 contract.  The privatization contract must be filed with the commissioner and the Attorney 
35 General prior to execution.
369.  Attorney General authority.  The authority of the Attorney General over the 
37 privatization of services is governed by this subsection.
38 A. At any time during the process of privatizing any services pursuant to this section, 
39 the Attorney General may:
40 (1)  Intervene in the process;
41 (2)  Require by summons the attendance and testimony under oath of state 
42 employees and the production of documents for the purpose of investigating 
43 whether the provisions set forth in this chapter and chapter 156 are met.  All 
Page 6 - 130LR0601(01)44 documents produced and testimony given to the Attorney General pursuant to this 
45 subparagraph are confidential. The Attorney General may seek an order from the 
46 Superior Court compelling compliance with a summons issued under this 
47 subparagraph; and
5 (3)  Bring an action in Superior Court in the name of the State against an agency 
6 when the Attorney General has reason to believe that a requirement of this section 
7 has not been met, the agency has acted unlawfully or beyond the scope of its 
8 authority, the actions or inactions of the agency are not supported by the record 
9 required by this section or the privatization of services is not in the public interest.
10 B.  After the filing of a court action under this subsection, further action by an agency 
11 under this section must be stayed unless the court orders otherwise.  During the period 
12 of the stay, any time period specified for agency action under this chapter or chapter 
13 156 is tolled until the court action is dismissed by the Attorney General or the Superior 
14 Court orders an agency to take further action.  Relief from the stay may be granted only 
15 upon a showing of compelling justification.
16 C.  Except as provided in this paragraph, at least 10 business days prior to 
17 commencement of an action under this subsection, the Attorney General shall notify 
18 the agency and the commissioner of the proposed action and shall provide the 
19 commissioner and the agency an opportunity to confer with the Attorney General in 
20 person or by counsel or other representative as to the proposed action.  The Attorney 
21 General may proceed without notice upon a showing by affidavit of immediate 
22 irreparable harm to the citizens of the State.
23 D.  An action by the Attorney General under this subsection may seek to, among other 
24 things, restrain by temporary or permanent injunction the privatization of services 
25 under this section, and the court may make such other orders or judgments as may be 
26 necessary to prevent the privatization of services.
2710.  Rules; forms.  The Department of Administrative and Financial Services may 
28 prescribe forms and adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section and to ensure that

Page 8 - 130LR0601(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill sets out requirements for certain state agencies seeking to enter into a contract 
3 to privatize services.  Prior to issuing a request for proposals, an agency must determine 
4 the minimum wage rate it pays the employees providing the services, the percentage of 
5 health insurance plan coverage provided by the State for those employees and their 
6 dependents and the cost to the agency to provide the services.  All bids and subsequent 
7 privatization contracts must pay the established minimum wage rate, provide comparable 
8 health insurance coverage and pay at least the same percentage for health insurance plan 
9 coverage as paid by the agency to employees providing the services and their dependents 
10 prior to the privatization.  The bid and successful contractor must offer employment to any 
11 agency employee displaced or terminated because of the privatization of services who 
12 meets the contractor's nondiscriminatory hiring criteria.  The bill allows agency employees, 
13 through an employee organization, to submit a bid to provide the services.  The bill allows 
14 an employee organization representing employees who will be displaced or terminated if 
15 the services are privatized to offer an amendment to the collective bargaining agreement 
16 that will lower the agency's cost to provide the services.  A privatization contract may not 
17 be executed if the total cost of the contract, including transition costs to move services from 
18 the agency to the contractor, is more than the agency's estimation of its cost to provide the 
19 services.  The bill requires all calculations, documents and other relevant materials to be 
20 submitted to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General may choose to review the 
21 materials and may request additional information during the review.  The bill grants 
22 authority to the Attorney General to intervene at any stage of the privatization process.  The 
23 bill also gives an employee organization the authority to request a review of the written 
24 statement prepared by the agency seeking to privatize services.  The Commissioner of 
25 Administrative and Financial Services is required to provide a response to such a request 
26 within 15 business days, and the decision is considered final agency action for purposes of 
27 judicial review. The Attorney General has the authority to bring an action to prevent or 
28 enjoin privatization in appropriate cases. 
29 The bill also establishes the State Procurement Review Committee to oversee requests 
30 for proposals and contracts and grants and renewals, extensions, amendments and other 
31 alterations to existing contracts and grants valued over $1,000,000.  The Office of the 
32 Attorney General must be consulted when the value equals or exceeds $3,000,000.
