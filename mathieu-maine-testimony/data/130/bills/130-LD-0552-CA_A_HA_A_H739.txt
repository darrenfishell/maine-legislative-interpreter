The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (I) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bit! does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities, 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires rule chapter 101 to be amended to provide that education technicians and other educators with direct 
regular contact may not be unreasonably denied participation at individualized education program (IEP) team 
meetings if requested by the parent or guardian, This amendment clarifies that it is not unreasonable to deny such 
participation if it requires expenditure of school funds.

This amendment also adds ongoing General Fund appropriations of $2,397 per year beginning in fiscal year 2021-22 
to a newly created Parental Consent -Mandate program within the Department of Education to reimburse local school 
administrative units for 90% of the costs of obtaining parental consent. This estimate assumes the methods of 
acquiring parental consent in the rule will include telephone calls, written conespondence sent through first class :1 
and, if no response is received, through certified mail with a return receipt requested. This estimate also assumes ., 
cost for a home and/or workplace visit by a principal in an attempt to obtain parental consent. This estimate may need 
to be revised depending on the methods of acquiring parental consent that are included in the final amended rule.
