Page 1 - 130LR2114(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §5219-YY, sub-§1, ¶I, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 482, §3 and 
3 affected by §5, is amended to read:
4 I.  "Qualified investment" means expenditures of at least $15,000,000 to design, permit, 
5 build, rebuild, modify, replace, repair or acquire machinery or equipment, including 
6 supporting equipment, to modernize or improve a paper manufacturing facility.  The 
7 expenditures of a qualified applicant and other entities, whether or not incorporated, 
8 that are part of a single business enterprise must be aggregated to determine whether a 
9 qualified investment has been made.  A qualified investment includes any amount 
10 spent, prior to the issuance of a certificate of approval, on machinery, equipment, repair 
11 parts, replacement parts or replacement equipment, including additions and accessions 
12 to other machinery and equipment, as long as the machinery, equipment, parts, 
13 additions or accessions are placed in service after the issuance of a certificate of 
14 approval.  A qualified investment does not include an investment made prior to January 
15 1, 2021 2019 or after December 31,  2025  2023.  "Qualified investment" does not 
16 include any amount expended to qualify for Pine Tree Development Zone program 
17 benefits under Title 30-A, chapter 206, subchapter 4.
18Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §5219-YY, sub-§3, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2021, c. 482, §3 and 
19 affected by §5, is amended to read:
20 A.  Subject to the limitations under paragraph B, beginning with the tax year during 
21 which a certificate of completion is issued under subsection 2, paragraph E or the tax 
22 year beginning in 2023  2024, whichever is later, and for each of the following 9 tax 
23 years, a certified applicant is allowed a credit against the tax due under this Part for the 
24 taxable year in an amount equal to 4% of the certified applicant's qualified investment.
25 The credit allowed under this subsection is refundable.
26Sec. 3.  PL 2021, c. 482, §5 is repealed.
27SUMMARY
28 This bill amends the law governing the refundable income tax credit for paper 
29 manufacturers by changing the definition of "qualified investment" to exclude investments 
30 made prior to January 1, 2019 or after December 31, 2023.  Public Law 2021, chapter 482 
31 excludes investments made prior to January 1, 2021 or after December 31, 2025.  The bill 
32 also amends Public Law 2021, chapter 482 to repeal the effective date of January 1, 2024.28
