4 The State Auditor is the head of the Office of the State Auditor.  The State Auditor 
5 must be a certified public accountant or a college graduate with not less than 6 years of 
6 experience as a professional accountant or auditor, including not less than 5 years of

11 elected every 4 years in the same manner as is the Governor.  If a vacancy occurs, the 
12 Governor shall appoint a successor who is subject to confirmation in the same manner as 
13 Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court.  The State Auditor shall exercise such the powers 
14 and perform such the duties as are set forth in this chapter.  In case the office of State 
15 Auditor becomes vacant during a period when the Legislature is not in session, the 
16 appointment of a person to fill such vacancy must be made immediately by the President 
17 of the Senate or if that office is vacant, by the Speaker of the House, and the person 
18 appointed holds that office until such time as the Legislature meets in regular or special 
19 session, and either confirm the appointment of the person or chooses another person to fill 
20 the office during the unexpired term.
