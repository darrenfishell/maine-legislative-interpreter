Revenue impact already reflected in current forecast 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill corrects a drafting error in Public Law 2021, chapter 398, which inadvertently limited a credit of 20% of the 
federal earned income tax credit for nonresidents and part-year residents to those who do not have a qualifying chi] , 
instead of making the credit available to all residents, nonresidents and part-year residents regardless of whether or ... ~-. 
the resident has a qualifying child. The fiscal note associated with Public Law 2021, chapter 398, already assumed the 
credit applied to this expanded group and the resulting loss in revenue is already reflected in the current revenue 
forecast.
