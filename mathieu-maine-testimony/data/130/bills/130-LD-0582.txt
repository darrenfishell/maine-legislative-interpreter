Page 1 - 130LR1291(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
4 period because MaineCare reimbursement rates for providing individualized intensive 
5 integrated mental health services, known as "assertive community treatment," have not 
6 been adjusted in many years and are insufficient to enable some providers to continue to 
7 provide services; and
8Whereas, the parameters and requirements for individualized intensive integrated 
9 mental health services must be reformed immediately in order to sustain the availability 
10 and effectiveness of these services by providing resources and criteria that support the 
11 fidelity of the assertive community treatment model; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15 therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17Sec. 1.  34-B MRSA §3801, sub-§4-C is enacted to read:
184-C.  Medical assistant.  "Medical assistant" means a person to whom certain activities 
19 relating to medical care and treatment have been delegated by a licensed physician or 
20 surgeon in compliance with Title 32, section 2594-A or 3270-A.
21Sec. 2.  34-B MRSA §3801, sub-§7-C is enacted to read:
227-C.  Psychiatric provider.  "Psychiatric provider" means a licensed health care 
23 provider with psychiatric training or experience, including without limitation a psychiatrist, 
24 psychiatric nurse practitioner or physician assistant.
25Sec. 3.  34-B MRSA §3801, sub-§11, as amended by PL 2017, c. 407, Pt. A, §159, 
26 is further amended to read:
2711.  Assertive community treatment.  "Assertive community treatment" or "ACT" 
28 means a self-contained, evidence-based service with a fixed point of responsibility for 
29 providing treatment, rehabilitation and support services to persons with mental illness for 
30 whom other community-based treatment approaches have been unsuccessful.  Assertive 
31 community treatment uses clinical and rehabilitative staff to address symptom stability; 
32 relapse prevention; maintenance of safe, affordable housing in normative settings that 
33 promote well-being; establishment of natural support networks to combat isolation and 
34 withdrawal; the minimizing of involvement with the criminal justice system; individual 
35 recovery education; and services to enable the person to function at a work site. Assertive 
36 community treatment is provided by multidisciplinary teams who are on duty 24 hours per 
37 day, 7 days per week; teams must include a psychiatrist psychiatric provider, registered 
38 nurse, certified rehabilitation counselor or certified employment specialist, a peer recovery 
39 specialist and a substance use disorder counselor and may include an occupational 
40 therapist, community-based mental health rehabilitation technician, psychologist, licensed 
41 clinical social worker or , licensed clinical professional counselor , medical assistant or 
42 person with training demonstrated by a 4-year postsecondary or graduate degree in a mental 
43 health related field.  An ACT team member who is a state employee is, while in good faith 
Page 2 - 130LR1291(01)44 performing a function as a member of an ACT team, performing a discretionary function 
45 within the meaning of Title 14, section 8104‑B, subsection 3.
3Sec. 4.  Reimbursement rate increase.  The Department of Health and Human 
4 Services shall increase reimbursement rates under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits 
5 Manual, Chapters II and III, Section 17 for assertive community treatment by 25% 
6 beginning on the effective date of this Act.
7Sec. 5.  Rulemaking.  The Department of Health and Human Services shall amend 
8 its rules governing the assertive community treatment, or ACT, program within 6 months 
9 after the effective date of this Act, with appropriate stakeholder involvement, to make the 
10 following changes to the program:
11 1.  Provide for a per member, per month reimbursement model that ensures adequate 
12 resources to provide services achieving fidelity to the evidence-based model for ACT 
13 services, using a per member, per month payment model;
14 2.  Ensure that limits are not placed on the duration of ACT services to any recipient 
15 and that ACT services remain the point of contact for all clients meeting the eligibility 
16 requirements for ACT for as long as necessary;
17 3.  Provide an initial authorization period of one year for clients meeting eligibility 
18 requirements for ACT and require reauthorization no more often than annually thereafter;
19 4.  Allow billing for services under the program for coordination of care during an 
20 initial engagement period of 90 days, when the recipient of those services is temporarily 
21 admitted to a hospital or resident in a jail or prison in this State and when the recipient is 
22 making a transition to a lower level of care, recognizing that the fidelity of the program to 
23 the ACT model requires continuity of treatment;
24 5.  Clarify that the minimum contact requirement is 3 contacts weekly on average over 
25 each year of authorized service and that a contact may be face to face, through a closed 
26 door or an outreach attempt at the home or in the community, including without limitation 
27 street outreach; and
28 6.  Ensure that medical eligibility to receive services under the program reflects an 
29 evidence-based understanding of the diagnoses and circumstances in which ACT is 
30 effective.
31 Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined in the 
32 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
33Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
34 takes effect when approved.
35SUMMARY
