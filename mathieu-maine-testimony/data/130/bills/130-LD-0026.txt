Page 1 - 130LR0118(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the sole purpose of the Board of Dental Practice is to protect the public 
4 health and welfare by ensuring that the public is served by competent and honest 
5 practitioners and by establishing minimum standards of proficiency; and
6Whereas, former board rule Chapter 9: Complaints/Investigations/Unprofessional 
7 Conduct, Section II, paragraph U, which was repealed effective April 5, 2020, contained 
8 language restricting a dentist's scope of practice to administer botulinum toxins and dermal 
9 fillers to dental procedures; and
10Whereas, substantive policy decisions such as expanding or restricting scopes of 
11 practice are appropriate for the legislative process, not an administrative rule-making 
12 process; and
13Whereas, immediate enactment of this legislation is necessary to continue protecting 
14 the public by ensuring that authorization for a dentist to administer botulinum toxin and 
15 dermal fillers to a patient as part of a dental treatment plan is continued as part of a dentist's 
16 scope of practice; and
17Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
19 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
20 therefore,
21Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
22Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §18325, sub-§1, ¶O, as amended by PL 2015, c. 488, §33, is 
23 further amended to read:
24 O.  A violation of this chapter or a rule adopted by the board; and
25Sec. 2.  32 MRSA §18325, sub-§1, ¶P, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 488, §34, is 
26 amended to read:
27 P.  Failure to comply with the requirements of Title 22, section 7253. ; and
28Sec. 3.  32 MRSA §18325, sub-§1, ¶Q is enacted to read:
29 Q.  Administering botulinum toxins or dermal fillers to a patient when that 
30 administration is not supported by a diagnosed dental condition or is not part of a 
31 patient's dental treatment plan.
32Sec. 4.  32 MRSA §18371, sub-§1, ¶M, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 429, §21, is 
33 amended to read:

36 board, administer sedation and general anesthesia necessary for proper dental 
37 treatment; and
38Sec. 5.  32 MRSA §18371, sub-§1, ¶N, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 429, §21, is 
39 amended to read:
Page 2 - 130LR0118(01)1 N.  Take case histories and perform physical examinations to the extent the activities 
2 are necessary in the exercise of due care in conjunction with the provision of dental 
3 treatment or the administration of anesthesia.  A dentist is not permitted to perform 
4 physical examinations within a hospital licensed by the Department of Health and 
5 Human Services unless this activity is permitted by the hospital. ; and
6Sec. 6.  32 MRSA §18371, sub-§1, ¶O is enacted to read:

8 condition or when that administration is identified as part of a patient's dental treatment 
9 plan.
10Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
11 takes effect when approved.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill authorizes within a dentist's scope of practice the use of botulinum toxins or 
14 dermal fillers when supported by a patient's diagnosed dental condition or as a part of a 
15 patient's dental treatment plan. It also adds additional grounds the Board of Dental Practice 
16 may consider when taking disciplinary action against a dentist to include administering 
17 botulinum toxins or dermal fillers to a patient for a nondental condition or treatment.
18 The bill places into statute the limitations on a dentist's administering botulinum toxins 
19 or dermal fillers that were in former Board of Dental Practice rule Chapter 9: 
20 Complaints/Investigations/Unprofessional Conduct, which was repealed and replaced on 
21 April 5, 2020.
