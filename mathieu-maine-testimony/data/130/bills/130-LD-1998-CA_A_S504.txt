Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, establishes the Farmers 
Drought Relief Grant Program to assist farmers in the State to overcome the adverse effects 
of drought conditions by providing grants, rather than a disaster relief grant program for 
potato farmers as in the bill. The amendment specifies that a farmer may apply for a grant 
if the farmer needs to establish a source for irrigation water to alleviate the risk of crop 
losses due to drought. 
The amendment also directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 
Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources to work with the Department of 
Environmental Protection and the Maine Land Use Planning Commission and other 
appropriate agencies to examine the permitting process for farmers seeking to secure 
permits for new sources of water for irrigation and to develop recommendations, including 
suggested legislation, to streamline the permitting process. The department is required to 
submit a report with findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation and forestry matters no later 
than January 1, 2023. The joint standing committee is authorized to submit a bill to the 
First Regular Session of the 131st Legislature relating to the subject matter of the report.

This bill creates the Farmers Drought Relief Grant Program and the Farmers Drought Relief Grant Program Fund 
(FDRGP) within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to provide grants to farmers impacted by 
the adverse effects of drought conditions. The bill also directs ACF to coordinate with the Land Use Planning 
Commission and the Department of Environmental Protection on strategies to streamline the irrigation permitting 
process and report these findings by January 1, 2023. The bill includes ongoing allocations of $500 to establish the 
FDRGP fund and allow for the acceptance of other funding from public and private sources. ACF has indicated that 
the scope and time line of the reporting requirements regarding the irrigation permitting process will require additional 
contracted resources to complete. The bill includes a one-time appropriation of $75,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 for 
contracted services.
