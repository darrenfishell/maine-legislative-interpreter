41.  Appointment.  The Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Advisory Council, established by 
5 Title 5, section 12004‑G, subsection 20 and referred to in this Part as the "advisory council," 
6 consists of 11 members, with 10 members representing the 16 counties of the State in the 
7 following manner: one member representing Androscoggin County, Kennebec County and 
8 Sagadahoc County; one member representing Aroostook County; one member representing

12 representing Piscataquis County and Somerset County; one member representing 
13 Washington County; and one member representing York County.  The 11th member must 
14 be a member of the Wabanaki Tribes.  Members of the advisory council are appointed by 
15 the Governor, subject to review by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
16 jurisdiction over fisheries and wildlife matters and to confirmation by the Legislature.  The 
17 Governor shall appoint the member who is a member of the Wabanaki Tribes based on the 
18 recommendation of the tribal governments of the Wabanaki Tribes, including the 
19 Aroostook Band of Micmacs, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy 
20 Tribe at Motahmikuk, the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik and the Penobscot Nation.  In 
21 recommending the appointment of the member who is a member of the Wabanaki Tribes, 
22 the tribal governments of the Wabanaki Tribes shall establish a process that provides for 
23 the membership to rotate among the tribal governments.  The commissioner or the 
24 commissioner's designee is a nonvoting, ex officio member of the advisory council, but 
25 may vote to break a tie.
26 An employee of the department may not serve as a member of the advisory council prior 
27 to the expiration of one year from that employee's last day of employment with the 
28 department.  A Legislator may not serve as a member of the advisory council.  A former 
29 Legislator who was a member of the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
30 jurisdiction over fisheries and wildlife matters may not serve as a member of the advisory 
31 council prior to the expiration of one year from that former Legislator's last day of 
32 membership on that committee.
33SUMMARY
34 This bill increases the membership of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Advisory 
35 Council by adding a member who represents the Wabanaki Tribes.
