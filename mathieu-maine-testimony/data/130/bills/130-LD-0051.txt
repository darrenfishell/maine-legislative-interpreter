6 This chapter may be known and cited as "the Maine Insurance Data Security Act."
7ยง2262.  Construction
8 This chapter establishes standards for data security and exclusive standards for the 
9 investigation of and notification to the superintendent regarding a cybersecurity event 
10 applicable to licensees. This chapter may not be construed to create or imply a private cause 
11 of action for violation of its provisions or to curtail a private cause of action that would 
12 otherwise exist in the absence of this chapter.
13ยง2263.  Definitions
14 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
15 have the following meanings.
161.  Authorized individual.  "Authorized individual" means an individual whose access 
17 to the nonpublic information held by a licensee and its information systems is authorized 
18 and determined by the licensee to be necessary and appropriate.

20 applicant for insurance, policyholder, insured, beneficiary, claimant or certificate holder, 
21 who is a resident of this State and whose nonpublic information is in a licensee's possession,

30 determined that the nonpublic information accessed by an unauthorized person has not been 
31 used or released and has been returned or destroyed.
324.  Encrypted.  "Encrypted," with respect to data, means that the data has been 
33 transformed into a form that results in a low probability of assigning meaning without the

12 such as mergers and acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures, outsourcing arrangements 
13 and changes to information systems.
148.  Incident response plan.  As part of its information security program, a licensee 
15 shall establish a written incident response plan designed to promptly respond to and recover 
16 from any cybersecurity event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability 
17 of nonpublic information in its possession; the licensee's information systems; or the

36 extent that an insurance carrier has identified areas, systems or processes that require 
37 material improvement, updating or redesign, the insurance carrier shall document the 
38 identification and the remedial efforts planned and underway to address such areas, systems 
39 or processes. The documentation required pursuant to this subsection must be available for 
40 inspection by the superintendent.

2
Page 7 - 130LR0114(01)11.  Investigation.  If a licensee learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have 
2 occurred, the licensee or an outside vendor or service provider designated to act on behalf 
3 of the licensee shall conduct a prompt investigation. During the investigation, the licensee

38 provider of which the licensee has become aware:
39 A.  The licensee shall respond to the cybersecurity event as described under subsection 
40 1; and
Page 9 - 130LR0114(01)1 B.  The computation of the licensee's deadlines for notification under this section
