Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill will adopt a Maine Mille Commission rule that creates a 4-tiered system and updates target prices for each 
tier based upon the breakeven cost of production used to make payouts through the Dairy Stabilization Program. It 
will decrease General Fund revenue by $8,751,652 in fiscal year 2022-23 and increase Other Special Revenue Funds 
revenue to the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry by the same amounts. The bill includes a corresponding increase in the Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocation to allow increased payouts through the program.
