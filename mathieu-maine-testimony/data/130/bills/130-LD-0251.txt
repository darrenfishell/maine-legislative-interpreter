Page 1 - 130LR0040(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §116, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 600, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Entities subject to assessments.  Every transmission and distribution, gas, 
5 telephone and water utility and ferry subject to regulation by the commission and every 
6 qualified telecommunications provider is subject to an assessment on its intrastate gross 
7 operating revenues to produce sufficient revenue for expenditures allocated by the 
8 Legislature for the Public Utilities Commission Regulatory Fund established pursuant to 
9 this section.  The budget for the Public Utilities Commission Regulatory Fund is subject to 
10 legislative review and approval in accordance with subsection 2.  The portion of the total 
11 assessment applicable to each category of public utility or qualified telecommunications 
12 provider is based on an accounting by the commission of the portion of the commission's 
13 resources devoted to matters related to each category.  The commission shall develop a 
14 reasonable and practicable method of accounting for resources devoted by the commission 
15 to matters related to each category of public utility or qualified telecommunications 
16 provider.  Assessments on each public utility or qualified telecommunications provider 
17 within each category must be based on the utility's or qualified telecommunications 
18 provider's gross intrastate operating revenues.  Within each category of public utility, the 
19 assessment must be apportioned and applied separately to investor-owned utilities and 
20 consumer-owned utilities.  The portion of the assessment applicable to investor-owned 
21 utilities and consumer-owned utilities within each category must be determined based on 
22 an accounting by the commission of the portion of the commission's resources devoted to 
23 matters related to investor-owned utilities and the portion devoted to matters related to 
24 consumer-owned utilities.  The commission shall determine the assessments annually prior 
25 to May 1st and assess each utility or qualified telecommunications provider for its pro rata 
26 share for expenditure during the fiscal year beginning July 1st.  Each utility or qualified 
27 telecommunications provider shall pay the assessment charged to the utility or qualified 
28 telecommunications provider on or before July 1st of each year.  Any increase in the 
29 assessment that becomes effective subsequent to May 1st may be billed on the effective 
30 date of the act authorizing the increase.
31 A.  The assessments charged to utilities and qualified telecommunications providers 
32 under this section are just and reasonable operating costs for rate-making purposes.
33 B.  For the purposes of this section, "intrastate gross operating revenues" means:
34 (1)  In the case of all utilities except telephone utilities, revenues derived from filed 
35 rates except revenues derived from sales for resale;
36 (2)  In the case of a telephone utility, all intrastate revenues, except revenues 
37 derived from sales for resale, whether or not the rates from which those revenues 
38 are derived are required to be filed pursuant to this Title; and
39 (3)  In the case of a qualified telecommunications provider, all intrastate revenues 
40 except revenues derived from sales for resale.
41 C.  Gas utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission solely with respect to 
42 safety are not subject to any assessment.
Page 2 - 130LR0040(01)1 D.  The commission may correct any errors in the assessments by means of a credit or 
2 debit to the following year's assessment rather than reassessing all utilities or qualified 
3 telecommunications providers in the current year.
4 E.  The commission may exempt utilities or qualified telecommunications providers 
5 with annual intrastate gross operating revenues under $50,000 from assessments under 
6 this section.
7 For purposes of this section, "qualified telecommunications provider" means a provider of 
8 interconnected voice over Internet protocol service that paid any assessment under this 
9 subsection, whether voluntarily, by agreement with the commission or otherwise, prior to 
10 March 1, 2012.

12 amended to read:
138.  Public Advocate assessment.  Every utility or qualified telecommunications 
14 provider subject to assessment under this section is subject to an additional annual 
15 assessment on its intrastate gross operating revenues to produce sufficient revenue for 
16 expenditures allocated by the Legislature for operating the Office of the Public Advocate.  
17 The portion of this assessment applicable to each category of public utility or qualified 
18 telecommunications provider is based on an accounting by the Public Advocate of 
19 resources devoted to matters related to each category.  The Public Advocate shall develop 
20 a reasonable and practicable method of accounting for resources devoted by the Public 
21 Advocate to matters related to each category of public utility or qualified 
22 telecommunications provider.  Assessments on each public utility or qualified 
23 telecommunications provider within each category must be based on the utility's or 
24 qualified telecommunications provider's gross intrastate operating revenues.  Within each 
25 category of public utility, the assessment must be apportioned and applied separately to 
26 investor-owned utilities and consumer-owned utilities. The portion of the assessment 
27 applicable to investor-owned utilities and to consumer-owned utilities within each category 
28 must be determined based on an accounting by the Public Advocate of the portion of the 
29 resources of the Office of the Public Advocate devoted to matters related to investor-owned 
30 utilities and the portion devoted to matters related to consumer-owned utilities.  The 
31 revenues produced from this assessment are transferred to the Public Advocate Regulatory 
32 Fund and may only be used only to fulfill the duties specified in chapter 17.  The 
33 assessments charged to utilities and qualified telecommunications providers under this 
34 subsection are considered just and reasonable operating costs for rate-making purposes.  
35 The Public Advocate shall develop a method of accounting for staff time within the Office 
36 of the Public Advocate.  All professional and support staff shall account for their time in 
37 such a way as to identify the percentage of time devoted to public utility and qualified 
38 telecommunications provider regulation and the percentage of time devoted to other duties 
39 that may be required by law.
40 A.  The Public Advocate shall submit its budget recommendations, using a zero-based 
41 budgeting process or other process or method directed by the State Budget Officer, as 
42 part of the unified current services budget legislation in accordance with Title 5, 
43 sections 1663 to 1666.  The assessments and expenditures provided in this section are 
44 subject to legislative approval.  The Public Advocate shall make an annual report of its 
Page 3 - 130LR0040(01)45 planned expenditures for the year and on its use of funds in the previous year.  The 
46 Public Advocate may also receive other funds as appropriated by the Legislature.
3 B.  The Public Advocate may use the revenues provided in accordance with this section 
4 to fund the Public Advocate and 10 employees and to defray the costs incurred by the 
5 Public Advocate pursuant to this Title, including administrative expenses, general 
6 expenses, consulting fees and all other reasonable costs incurred to administer this 
7 Title.
8 C-1.  Funds that are not expended at the end of a fiscal year do not lapse but must be 
9 carried forward to be expended for the purposes specified in this section in succeeding 
10 fiscal years.
