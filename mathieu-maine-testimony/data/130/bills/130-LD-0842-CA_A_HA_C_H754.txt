Legislative Cost/Study 
This amendment changes the report date for this study from December 1, 2021 to December 1, 2022 and adjusts the 
timing of appointments of commission members. The general operating expenses of $2,750 for this nonemergency 
resolve are moved from fiscal year 2021-22 to fiscal year 2022-23. The Legislature's budget for the 2022-2023 
biennium includes an estimated $8,401 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $10,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 for the costs of 
legislative studies, as well as $31,260 of balances carried over from prior years for this purpose. Whether these 
amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council 
and the Legislature. The additional costs of providing staffing assistance to the study during the interim can be 
absorbed utilizing existing budgeted staff resources. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the Department of Corrections or to the Office of the Attorney General to serve on the 
commission are still assumed to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
