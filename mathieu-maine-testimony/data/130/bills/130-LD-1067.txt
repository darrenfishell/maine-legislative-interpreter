2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA c. 914-E is enacted to read:
3CHAPTER 914-E
42021 TAX AMNESTY PROGRAM
5§6621.  2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program established
6 There is established the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program, referred to in this chapter 
7 as "the tax amnesty program."  The tax amnesty program is intended to encourage 
8 delinquent taxpayers to comply with the State's tax law and to enable the assessor to 
9 identify and collect previously unreported taxes and to accelerate collection of certain 
10 delinquent tax liabilities.  The long-term goal of the tax amnesty program is to improve 
11 taxpayer compliance with the State's tax law.
12§6622.  Administration
13 The assessor shall administer the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program.  The tax amnesty 
14 program applies to tax liabilities delinquent as of September 30, 2021, including tax due 
15 for which a return has not been filed.  A taxpayer may participate in the tax amnesty 
16 program whether or not the taxpayer is under audit and without regard to whether the 
17 amount due is subject to a pending administrative or judicial proceeding, except that this 
18 does not include pending criminal action or debts for which the State has secured a warrant 
19 or civil judgment in its favor in Superior Court.  A taxpayer may participate in the tax 
20 amnesty program to the extent of the uncontested portion of an assessed liability.  
21 Participation in the program is conditioned upon the taxpayer's agreement to forgo the right 
22 to protest or pursue an administrative or judicial proceeding with regard to returns filed 
23 under the tax amnesty program or to claim any refund of money paid under the tax amnesty 
24 program.  A taxpayer with a tax liability within the limitations of this chapter is absolved 
25 from criminal or civil prosecution or civil penalties plus 1/2 of the interest associated with 
26 any such liability except as otherwise provided in this chapter if the taxpayer:
271.  Return filed.  Properly completes and files a 2021 amnesty tax return as described 
28 in section 6625 and as required by the assessor;
292.  Tax and interest paid.  Pays all tax and interest as determined on the 2021 amnesty 
30 tax return, described in section 6625, before the end of the amnesty period;
313.  No criminal action pending.  Is not currently charged with, and has not been 
32 accepted by the Attorney General for criminal prosecution arising from, a violation of the 
33 state tax law as provided in this Title or Title 17-A, or is not applying for relief on a debt 
34 that is the result of a criminal conviction; and
354.  No collection by warrant or civil action.  Is not applying for relief with respect to 
36 a tax liability for which the State has secured a warrant or civil judgment in its favor in 
37 Superior Court.
38§6623.  Undisclosed liabilities
39 Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prohibit the assessor from instituting civil 
40 or criminal proceedings against any taxpayer with respect to any amount of tax that is not 
Page 2 - 130LR0679(01)41 disclosed either on the 2021 amnesty tax return, described in section 6625, or on any other 
42 return filed with the assessor.
3§6624.  Amnesty period
4 The time period during which a 2021 amnesty tax return, described in section 6625, 
5 may be filed is October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
6§6625.  Amnesty tax return
7 The assessor shall prepare and make available the 2021 amnesty tax return, referred to 
8 in this chapter as "the amnesty tax return."  The return and associated guidelines prepared 
9 by the assessor that govern participation in the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program are 
10 exempt from the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  The application requires the 
11 approval of the assessor.  The assessor may deny any application not consistent with the 
12 tax amnesty program.
13§6626.  Preamnesty settlements
14 Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the assessor shall, during 
15 the period beginning on the effective date of this chapter to October 1, 2021, make a 
16 settlement offer that requires full payment of tax and 1/2 of the accrued interest to any 
17 taxpayer that has a recorded and recognized delinquent state tax liability as of the effective 
18 date of this chapter.  The settlement offer authorized under this section does not apply to a 
19 taxpayer whose liability is the result of a criminal conviction or is currently charged with a 
20 criminal offense arising from a violation of the state tax law as provided in this Title or 
21 Title 17-A or has been referred to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution.
22Sec. 2.  Preamnesty collections; legislative intent.  The Legislature finds that it 
23 is in the best interest of the State and public welfare of the people of Maine to ensure that 
24 there is no delay in the payment of delinquent state tax liabilities as a result of the 2021 
25 Maine Tax Amnesty Program established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, chapter 
26 914-E.  The Legislature further finds that many taxpayers are likely to defer payment of 
27 delinquent tax liabilities in order to take advantage of lower interest and penalty amounts 
28 available under the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program.  Therefore, to ensure the timely 
29 collection of state tax revenue prior to the effective date of the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty 
30 Program, the Legislature encourages the State Tax Assessor to use the full extent of the 
31 State Tax Assessor's authority under Title 36, including the abatement of interest and 
32 penalty consistent with the provisions of the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program.
33SUMMARY
34 This bill, for the purposes of encouraging delinquent taxpayers to comply with the law, 
35 collecting unreported taxes and accelerating the collection of certain delinquent state tax 
36 liabilities, enacts the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program.  Under the program, a person 
37 with a tax delinquency as of September 30, 2021 may pay the taxes owed, plus half the 
38 accrued interest, without incurring any other criminal or civil liability.  The period during 
39 which a delinquency may be paid under the 2021 Maine Tax Amnesty Program is from 
40 October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.  The program is not available for debts for which 
41 the State has secured a warrant or civil judgment in the State's favor.
42 From the effective date of this legislation until September 30, 2021, the State Tax 
43 Assessor is required to offer a delinquent taxpayer the same benefits of the 2021 Maine 1
