Page 1 - 130LR0072(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3763, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 588, Pt. D, §4, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Family contract.  During the TANF orientation process, a representative of the 
5 department and the TANF recipient shall enter into a family contract.  The family contract 
6 must state the responsibilities of the parties to the agreement including, but not limited to, 
7 cooperation in child support enforcement and determination of paternity, the requirements 
8 of the ASPIRE-TANF program and referral to parenting activities and health care services.  
9 Except as provided in section 3762, subsection 4, refusal to sign the family contract or to 
10 abide by the provisions of the contract, except for referral to parenting activities and health 
11 care services, will result in termination of benefits under subsection 1-A.  Failure to comply 
12 with referrals to parenting activities or health care services without good cause will result 
13 in a review and evaluation of the reason for noncompliance by the representative of the 
14 department and may result in sanctions.  Written copies of the family contract and a notice 
15 of the right to a fair hearing must be given to the individual. The family contract must be 
16 amended in accordance with section 3788 when a participant enters the ASPIRE-TANF 
17 program and when participation review occurs.
18 Benefits that have been terminated under subsection 1‑A must be restored once the 
19 noncomplying adult recipient signs a new family contract and complies with its provisions.
20Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3763, sub-§1-A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 380, Pt. PP, §4, is 
21 amended to read:
221-A.  Partial and full termination of benefits.  Benefits under this chapter must be 
23 terminated by the department under the provisions of subsection 1 and sections 3785 and 
24 3785-A as follows:  in accordance with this subsection.  If an adult recipient fails to meet 
25 the conditions of a family contract, the department shall reduce the family's amount of 
26 assistance by terminating benefits that apply to that noncomplying adult.
27 A.  For a first failure to meet the conditions of a family contract, termination of benefits 
28 applies to the adult recipient;
29 B.  For a first failure to meet the conditions of a family contract for which termination 
30 of benefits under paragraph A lasts for longer than 90 days and for a 2nd and 
31 subsequent violation, termination of benefits applies to the adult recipient and the full 
32 family unit; and
33 C.  Prior to the implementation of a full family unit sanction, the department shall offer 
34 the adult recipient an opportunity to claim good cause for noncompliance as described 
35 in section 3785.
36 Benefits that have been terminated under this subsection must be restored once the 
37 noncomplying adult recipient signs a new contract under subsection 1 and complies with 
38 the provisions of the family contract.
39SUMMARY
40 Under current law, the Department of Health and Human Services terminates 
41 assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to the entire 
42 family, including children, if the children's parent fails to comply with requirements of the 
Page 2 - 130LR0072(01)43 family contract for a period of 90 days or for any subsequent failure.  This bill amends that 
44 provision to terminate benefits for the noncomplying parent but continues to provide 
45 assistance to the children and complying parents.1
