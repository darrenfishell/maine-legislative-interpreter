26§752-B.  Exterior absentee ballot drop boxes or drop slots
27 A municipality may obtain and deploy an absentee ballot drop box or drop slot for use 
28 by voters of that municipality to return their voted ballots without requiring contact with 
29 an election official.  A municipality may obtain and deploy additional absentee ballot drop 
30 boxes at other locations within the municipality, subject to the approval of the Secretary of 
31 State.  The clerk must submit a certification to the Secretary of State at least 90 days before 
32 the election that the additional absentee ballot drop boxes will meet the requirements of 
33 this section, other than the requirements for location outside the municipal office building. 
34 Delivery to an absentee ballot drop box or drop slot pursuant to this section constitutes 
35 delivery to the clerk as provided in section 754-A.  An absentee ballot drop box or drop 
36 slot must comply with guidelines issued by the Secretary of State to ensure accessibility to 
37 individuals with disabilities and must meet the following requirements.
381.  Security; location.  An absentee ballot drop box or drop slot must be located outside 
39 the municipal office building or the building where in-person absentee voting is taking 
40 place before an election, if separate from the municipal office building.  The absentee ballot 
41 drop box or drop slot must be secured so that it cannot be moved or removed by any 
42 unauthorized person.  If the absentee ballot drop box or drop slot is positioned against an 
43 outside wall of the building, it must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the building 
44 wall or to the deck or landing.  If the absentee ballot drop box is located away from the 
Page 5 - 130LR0439(01)45 municipal building, it must be set onto a post that is sunk into the ground or set into a 
46 concrete pad or bolted or otherwise securely affixed to a platform or other structure. When 
47 in use for an election, the absentee ballot drop box or drop slot must be monitored 
48 periodically by law enforcement personnel, municipal staff or a surveillance camera.  A 
49 drop slot must be attached to a secure collection box.
62.  Secure method for ballot deposit.  An absentee ballot drop box must provide a 
7 slot or chute that the voter can use to deposit an absentee ballot envelope into a collection 
8 box.  This slot or chute must be designed so that it prevents anyone from reaching in and 
9 accessing absentee ballot envelopes deposited into the box and so that the deposited ballots 
10 are protected from the elements.  The slot or chute also must have a mechanism to close 
11 and lock the absentee ballot drop box so that no ballots can be deposited once it is closed 
12 and locked.  The absentee ballot drop box may not consist simply of a slot in an outside 
13 doorway to the municipal building or allow the envelopes to fall to the floor and remain 
14 unsecured.  A slot or drop slot must feed directly into a secure, locked collection box, so 
15 that the deposited absentee ballot envelopes remain secured until the municipal clerk or 
16 designee removes the envelopes and secures them in the clerk’s office.
173.  Clear label.  An absentee ballot drop box or drop slot must be labeled, or a sign 
18 must be posted on or near the absentee ballot drop box or drop slot, to indicate that it is an 
19 official absentee ballot drop box or drop slot.  Unless an absentee ballot drop box is affixed 
20 to the outside wall of the municipal office building, it must display the name of the 
21 municipality.  An absentee ballot drop box may have an additional sign instructing voters 
22 about absentee voting requirements, including warnings against use by voters of other 
23 municipalities.
244.  Use and access during absentee voting period.  During the period when absentee 
25 voting is taking place before an election, the absentee ballot drop box or drop slot must be 
26 used only for collection of absentee ballot envelopes and not for other municipal office 
27 filings or payments.  The contents of an absentee ballot drop box or drop slot collection 
28 box must be accessible only to the municipal clerk or designees.  No other municipal staff 
29 may have keys or access to the drop box or drop slot collection box contents during the 
30 absentee voting period.  If items other than absentee ballot envelopes are deposited into an 
31 absentee ballot drop box, the municipal clerk or designee is responsible for delivering those 
32 items to the appropriate municipal official.
335.  Periodic retrieval of ballots.  An absentee ballot drop box must have a locking 
34 access door or cover that allows the municipal clerk or designee to open and retrieve the 
35 absentee ballot envelopes.  During the absentee voting period, the municipal clerk or a team 
36 of 2 people designated by the clerk must periodically remove absentee ballot envelopes 
37 from an absentee ballot drop box and deliver the envelopes to the municipal clerk's office 
38 to be secured until they can be processed.  At a minimum, absentee ballot envelopes must 
39 be retrieved on each day that the municipal clerk's staff is working in the office.  Absentee 
40 ballot envelopes may be retrieved on other days as necessary based on the level of absentee 
41 voting to ensure that the absentee ballot drop box does not get so full that no other absentee 
42 ballot envelopes can be deposited and so that deposited absentee ballot envelopes do not 
43 become accessible to unauthorized persons.  The municipality must keep a log noting each 
44 time an absentee ballot drop box is emptied and have each person emptying the absentee 
45 ballot drop box initial or sign the log.  The log form must be designed by the Secretary of 
46 State.  On election night, the clerk or team of designees shall arrive at the absentee ballot 1
