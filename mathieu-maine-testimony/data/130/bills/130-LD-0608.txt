26 commissioners for that county.  If the Governor is temporarily absent from the State or 
27 is otherwise unavailable, the next person in the State who would act as Governor if the 
28 office of the Governor were vacant may, by oral proclamation, declare the fact that a 
29 civil emergency exists or appears sufficiently imminent to activate emergency plans in 
30 any or all areas of the State in accordance with this paragraph.  A written copy of the

10 takes effect when approved.
11SUMMARY
12 This bill requires the Governor to convene the Legislature if a declared state of 
13 emergency is to be in effect for longer than 30 days.  If the Legislature does not, by a 2/3 
14 vote in each House, vote to extend the state of emergency, the Governor may not declare a 
15 similar, subsequent state of emergency.
16 The bill also requires the Governor to convene the Legislature if, after a state of 
17 emergency is declared, an order or rule issued by the Governor is to be in effect for longer 
18 than 30 days.  The Legislature must, by a 2/3 vote in each House, vote to extend the 
19 Governor's authority to extend that order or rule.
20 The bill also limits the Governor's authority to declare a state of emergency in a county 
21 unless the county's board of commissioners has declared that a disaster or civil emergency 
22 exists.1
