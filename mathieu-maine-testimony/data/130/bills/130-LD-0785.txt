3 amended to read:
4 D.  For the purposes of section 3873‑A, in  In view of the person's treatment history, 
5 current behavior and inability to make an informed decision, a reasonable likelihood 
6 that the person's mental health will deteriorate and that the person will in the 
7 foreseeable future pose a likelihood of serious harm as defined in paragraphs paragraph 
8 A, B or C.
9SUMMARY
10 This bill allows a medical practitioner to consider a person's treatment history, current 
11 behavior and inability to make an informed decision in determining whether there is a 
12 likelihood of serious harm when examining a patient for the purposes of recommending 
13 hospitalization.  Current law allows this consideration only for progressive treatment 
14 programs.
