17 that is disposed of or otherwise placed in a solid waste landfill in that calendar year exceeds 
18 the total weight of the solid waste initially generated within the State that was incinerated 
19 or processed by that facility in that calendar year, any such excess residue generated by that

31 SUMMARY 
32 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
33 makes the following changes to the solid waste management laws. 
34 I. It amends the defmition of "waste generated within the State" to provide that if the 
35 total weight of the residue generated in a calendar year by an incineration facility, recycling 
36 facility or solid waste processing facility that is disposed of or otherwise placed in a solid 
3 7 waste landfill in that calendar year exceeds the total weight of the solid waste initially 
3 8 generated within the State that was incinerated or processed by that facility in that calendar 
39 year, any such excess residue generated by that facility is not considered waste generated 
40 within the State. 
41 2. It provides that certain solid waste processing facilities that were in operation during 
42 calendar year 2018 and accept exclusively construction and demolition debris must reuse

or recycle at least 30% of such debris through methods other than placement in a solid 
waste landfill by January 1, 2024, at least 40% of such debris through methods other than 
placement in a solid waste landfill by January 1, 2025 and at least 50% of such debris 
through methods other than placement in a solid waste landfill by January 1, 2026. Like 
the bill, the amendment also eliminates the provision of law that authorizes such facilities 
to request a waiver from the Department of Environmental Protection from otherwise 
applicable reuse and recycling requirements. 
3. Like the bill, it adds environmental justice to the public benefit determination 
standards for solid waste disposal facilities but it additionally provides a definition for 
"environmental justice." 
The amendment directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of General Services to evaluate options for the renegotiation of the operating 
services agreement of February 5, 2004, as amended, governing the operation of the state­
owned solid waste landfill in Old Town for the purpose of ensuring that existing capacity 
at that landfill is prioritized for management of waste initially generated within the State 
within the meaning of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 1303-C, subsection 
40-A, paragraph A. By January 15, 2023, the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services, Bureau of General Services is directed to report to the joint standing committee 
of the Legislature having jurisdiction over environment and natural resources matters the 
results of that evaluation and to provide any recommendations for legislative action 
necessary to ensure that existing capacity at the state-owned solid waste landfill in Old 
Town is prioritized for management of waste initially generated within the State. After 
receiving the report, the joint standing committee may report out legislation to implement 
any such recommendations. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.

Currently, construction and demolition debris originating out-of-state is subject to a $2 per ton fee and the proceeds 
are used to reimburse municipalities for the costs of landfill closure and remediation. This bill increases the 
percentage of construction and demolition debris that must be reused or recycled, reducing the amount of material 
subject to the fee. The Department of Environmental Protection estimates that this will reduce Other Special Revenue 
Funds revenue by $375,000 annually beginning in fiscal year 2022-23. The bill includes a deallocation of the same 
amount in the funding used to reimburse municipalities beginning in fiscal year 2022-23. 
Additional costs to the Bureau of General Services in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
