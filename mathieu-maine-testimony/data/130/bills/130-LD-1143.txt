Page 1 - 130LR1904(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §6002, first ¶, as amended by PL 2015, c. 293, §6, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 Tenancies at will must be terminated by either party by a minimum of 30 days' notice, 
5 except as provided in subsections 2 and 4  as set forth in subsections 1 and 2, in writing for 
6 that purpose given to the other party, but if the landlord or the landlord's agent has made at 
7 least 3 good faith efforts to serve the tenant, that service may be accomplished by both 
8 mailing the notice by first class mail to the tenant's last known address and by leaving the 
9 notice at the tenant's last and usual place of abode.  In cases when the tenant has paid rent 
10 through the date when a 30-day notice would expire, the notice must expire on or after the 
11 date through which the rent has been paid.  Either party may waive in writing the 30 days' 
12 notice at the time the notice is given, and at no other time prior to the giving of the notice.  
13 A termination based on a 30-day notice is not affected by the receipt of money, whether 
14 previously owed or for current use and occupation, until the date a writ of possession is 
15 issued against the tenant during the period of actual occupancy after receipt of the notice.  
16 When the tenancy is terminated, the tenant is liable to the process of forcible entry and 
17 detainer without further notice and without proof of any relation of landlord and tenant 
18 unless the tenant has paid, after service of the notice, rent that accrued after the termination 
19 of the tenancy.  These provisions apply to tenancies of buildings erected on land of another 
20 party.  Termination of the tenancy is deemed to occur at the expiration of the time fixed in 
21 the notice. A 30-day notice under this paragraph and a 7-day notice under subsection 2 may 
22 be combined in one notice to the tenant.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill provides that a landlord may not terminate a tenancy at will without cause.24
