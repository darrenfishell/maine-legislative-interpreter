21SUMMARY
22 This bill changes the headnote of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17, section 2003-A 
23 to clarify that this section of law prohibits public drinking.
24 The bill also makes a number of changes to Title 28-A, the State's liquor laws, to 
25 standardize the language used in those laws, to correct errors, conflicts, ambiguities, 
26 omissions and inconsistencies in those laws and to revise those laws, including by making 
27 the following changes.
28 1.  It makes a number of changes to address ambiguities, inconsistencies and conflicts 
29 in the laws governing certificates of approval, including the following.
30 A.  It resolves a conflict in the law by removing in-state manufacturers, that receive 
31 licenses, from a provision requiring persons engaged in certain activities to obtain 
32 certificates of approval.
33 B.  It changes from a certificate of approval to a license the type of authority that a 
34 person that operates a special warehouse storage facility must obtain because the laws 
35 specific to certificate of approval holders generally do not apply to special warehouse 
36 storage facilities.  It further clarifies which laws are applicable to licensed special 
37 warehouse storage facilities.
38 C.  It removes ambiguities by clarifying which of the general qualification and 
39 application requirements for liquor licenses apply to applicants for a certificate of 
40 approval and by specifying that persons that have been issued certificates of approval 1
2
22
23
Page 94 - 130LR0452(01)41 are subject to administrative discipline for violating liquor laws and rules under Title 
42 28-A, chapter 33 to the same extent as persons that have been issued licenses.
3 D.  It removes a conflict in the law by repealing a provision requiring the Department 
4 of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
5 Operations to deposit the yearly fees paid by certificate of approval holders into the 
6 General Fund because, under Title 28-A, section 83-B, the bureau is directed to deposit 
7 its net revenues in the General Fund.
8 2.  It removes ambiguous language from the Title 28-A definitions section stating that 
9 only "responsible persons" or "persons of good reputation" may obtain certain types of 
10 liquor licenses but retains the general character requirements for licensure set forth in 
11 section 654.
12 3.  It clarifies that agency liquor stores sell not only spirits but also malt liquor and 
13 wine.  It moves the definitions of "pool hall" and "minibar" into and the definitions of "club 
14 member," "hotel guest," "dining car," "passenger car" and "vessel" out of the subsection of 
15 law that provides definitions for the types of establishments eligible to obtain retail liquor 
16 licenses.  It also ensures consistent use of these defined terms throughout the Title.
17 4.  It replaces the word "club" with the word "center" in the statutes describing the 
18 requirements for licensure of indoor racquet centers, ice skating centers and curling centers 
19 to dispel confusion regarding whether the licensure requirements applicable to clubs apply 
20 to these centers.  It also corrects several errors in the law that, in combination, suggest 
21 curling centers may be licensed to sell only wine and not spirits or malt liquor.
22 5.  It makes a number of changes to the laws requiring that certain on-premises retail 
23 licensees either offer food to the public or sell a specific amount of food to the public to 
24 maintain their eligibility for a liquor license, including:
25 A.  Replacing several duplicative definitions of "full course meal" with the 
26 substantively identical definition of "full meal" that also appears in current law and 
27 ensuring consistent use of this defined term throughout the Title;
28 B. Removing language regarding the service of meals from the definition of "hotel," 
29 because hotels are not required to sell meals to the public under existing law;
30 C.  Removing a conflict in current law by specifying that a hotel with a Class I-A 
31 license is not required to have 10% of its gross annual income from the sale of food;
32 D.  Clarifying that, to calculate whether a hotel that does not have a Class I-A license 
33 has satisfied the requirement that at least 10% of its gross annual income be from the 
34 sale of food, the hotel's income from the rental of rooms or from the sale of liquor in 
35 separately licensed minibars is not included.  This new provision matches current 
36 practice and mirrors an existing provision of law that excludes income from the 
37 bowling business in calculating whether the bowling center has satisfied the 
38 requirement that at least 10% of its gross annual income be from the sale of food;
39 E.  Clarifying that qualified catering services may be located in unincorporated places 
40 and filling an omission in current law by specifying that a licensed part-time qualified 
41 catering service that operates for no more than 3 months in a year in a municipality 
42 having a population of 20,001 to 30,000 persons must have a minimum annual gross 
43 income of $10,000 from the sale of food to the public;1
2
Page 95 - 130LR0452(01)1 F.  Standardizing language regarding the Department of Administrative and Financial 
2 Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations' assessment of 
3 whether an applicant for an initial on-premises retail license is likely to meet or an 
4 applicant for renewal of an on-premises retail license has met any applicable food-sales 
5 requirements; and
6 G.  Establishing a new one-year grace period for an on-premises retail establishment 
7 that applies for license renewal but did not meet an applicable food-sales requirement 
8 during the previous year.
9 6.  It corrects an error in current law indicating that licensed Class A restaurants and 
10 Class A restaurants/lounges must purchase spirits that they will offer to customers as 
11 complimentary samples from the bureau and instead provides that those spirits must be 
12 purchased from reselling agents.
13 7.  It defines "spirits supplier," a previously undefined term, and standardizes the 
14 statutory language used to describe spirits suppliers throughout the State's liquor laws, 
15 including by removing references to spirits brokers that are now included in the "spirits 
16 supplier" definition and removing statutory language made redundant by the new terms.  It 
17 also newly authorizes spirits suppliers to offer sweepstakes, games and contests inside 
18 packages of spirits under the same conditions that licensed Maine manufacturers, wholesale 
19 licensees and retail licensees may offer sweepstakes, games and contests inside packages 
20 of liquor.
21 8.  It replaces the term "liquor," which is defined for purposes of the State's liquor laws 
22 to mean malt liquor, wine and spirits, with more specific terms in several statutes when all 
23 3 types of alcohol are not intended to be included.
24 9.  It removes unnecessary statutory references to fortified wine in statutes that govern 
25 wine generally, because "wine" is defined for purposes of the State's liquor laws to include 
26 fortified wine.
27 10.  It resolves an inconsistency by providing that public service corporation licenses 
28 are issued to airline corporations, railroad corporations and vessel corporations and not the 
29 individual aircraft, dining cars, passenger cars and vessels that those corporations operate 
30 in the State.  It also removes a duplicative statute governing public service corporations 
31 and standardizes the language used throughout the Title regarding public service 
32 corporations.
33 11.  It clarifies an ambiguity in the law by specifying that the term "wholesale licensee" 
34 as used in the State's liquor laws means only a licensed in-state wholesaler of malt liquor 
35 or wine and not an out-of-state wholesaler of malt liquor or wine that has been issued a 
36 certificate of approval.  It also extends the prohibition against a wholesale licensee selling 
37 to another wholesale licensee any malt liquor or wine that has not been purchased from a 
38 certificate of approval holder or a licensed special warehouse storage facility to a 
39 prohibition against a wholesale licensee selling such products to any purchaser, including 
40 a retail licensee.
41 12.  It replaces the phrase "wholesale liquor provider" with the phrase "wholesale 
42 spirits provider" throughout the State's liquor laws to more accurately describe the scope 
43 of that entity's authority in the State.  It also removes an inconsistency in the law by 
44 specifying that the wholesale spirits provider and the principal officers of the wholesale 
Page 96 - 130LR0452(01)45 spirits provider may not hold or have a direct financial interest in an agency liquor store 
46 license or a license to manufacture any type of liquor in this State or another state.
3 13.  It makes several changes to the laws governing hard cider to address ambiguities 
4 and omissions in those laws in a manner that matches current practice, including by making 
5 the following changes.
6 A.  Although hard cider technically meets the definition of "wine" under existing law, 
7 it adds clarifying language expressly stating that hard cider is considered "wine" for 
8 purposes of the Title.
9 B.  It clarifies that hard cider may be sold by retailers licensed to sell either malt liquor 
10 or wine for on-premises or off-premises consumption.
11 C.  It provides that hard cider may be sold and distributed within the State by wholesale 
12 licensees authorized to sell and distribute either malt liquor or wine within the State.
13 D.  It clarifies that hard cider is not subject to the general 60¢ per gallon excise tax on 
14 wine set forth in Title 28-A, section 1652, subsection 2.  Hard cider products are instead 
15 subject only to the 35¢ per gallon excise tax on hard cider set forth in the same 
16 subsection.
17 14.  It makes several changes to the laws governing low-alcohol spirits products to 
18 address ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions in those laws, including by making the 
19 following changes.
20 A.  It clarifies that products containing less than 1/2 of 1% of alcohol by volume are 
21 not considered low-alcohol spirits products, just as all products containing less than 1/2 
22 of 1% of alcohol by volume are not considered liquor and thus not subject to regulation 
23 under the Title.
24 B.  It newly specifies that licensed Maine distilleries, small distilleries, tenant breweries 
25 and rectifiers are authorized to produce low-alcohol spirits products and that licensed 
26 Maine breweries, small breweries and tenant breweries are authorized to produce low-
27 alcohol spirits products containing malt liquor.  Current law already authorizes licensed 
28 Maine wineries and tenant wineries to produce low-alcohol spirits products that contain 
29 wine, because these products are included in the definition of "fortified wine."
30 C.  It specifies that, as is current practice, low-alcohol spirits products may be sold and 
31 distributed within the State by wholesale licensees authorized to sell and distribute 
32 wine within the State.
33 D.  It clarifies that, as is current practice, low-alcohol spirits products that qualify as 
34 fortified wine are not subject to the general 60¢ per gallon excise tax on wine under 
35 Title 28-A, section 1652, subsection 2.  All low-alcohol spirits products are instead 
36 subject to a $1.24 per gallon excise tax under section 1652, subsection 1-A and a 30¢ 
37 per gallon low-alcohol spirits product tax under section 1365.
38 15.  It replaces the phrase "alcoholic beverages," which is not defined for the purposes 
39 of the State's liquor laws, with the appropriate defined terms throughout the liquor laws.
40 16.  It combines in a single section of statute the licensing fees for agency liquor stores 
41 that are currently listed in separate provisions.  It also removes an ambiguity in the law by 
42 clarifying that, as is the current practice, agency liquor store licenses grant authority to sell 
43 not only spirits but also malt liquor and wine for off-premises consumption.1
2
Page 97 - 130LR0452(01)1 17.  It clarifies that an applicant for a liquor license must possess all licenses, permits 
2 or approvals required under Title 22 for the applicant's underlying business before applying 
3 for the liquor license.
4 18.  It removes inconsistencies in several provisions of the liquor laws regarding the 
5 types of establishments eligible to obtain auxiliary licenses, off-premises catering licenses 
6 and mobile service bar licenses.  It also specifies that, as is current practice, when an on-
7 premises retail licensee obtains an off-premises catering license, that license authorizes the 
8 licensee to conduct off-premises catering of only the same type or types of liquor that the 
9 licensee may sell pursuant to the licensee's underlying on-premises retail license.
10 19.  It makes a number of changes to the laws governing liquor taste-testing events and 
11 product sampling activities to address ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions in those 
12 laws, including the following.
13 A.  It clarifies that the prohibitions against serving liquor to minors or to visibly 
14 intoxicated persons apply to all authorized liquor taste-testing and product sampling 
15 events.
16 B.  It removes a requirement that retailers that seek written permission from the bureau 
17 to conduct spirits, wine or malt liquor taste-testing events provide the names of any 
18 licensed sales representatives who will be pouring samples at those events.
19 C.  It newly specifies who, other than a licensed sales representative, may pour samples 
20 at taste-testing and product sampling events.  Under the bill, samples may also be 
21 poured by an employee of the off-premises or on-premises retailer where the taste-
22 testing or product sampling event takes place or, where applicable, by the owner or 
23 employee of the licensed Maine manufacturer that produced the product being tasted 
24 or sampled.
25 D.  It clarifies an ambiguity by specifying that, other than during an authorized taste-
26 testing or product sampling event, an off-premises retail licensee has a duty to prevent 
27 the consumption of liquor on that retail licensee's premises.
28 E.  It resolves a conflict in current law by providing that, when an authorized taste-
29 testing event is held on a portion of the premises of an on-premises retail licensee, the 
30 bureau must temporarily suspend the authority of the on-premises retail licensee to sell 
31 liquor for on-premises consumption in the area designated for the taste-testing event.  
32 The on-premises retail licensee may nevertheless continue to sell liquor for on-
33 premises consumption on the portion of its premises that falls outside the area 
34 designated for the taste-testing event.
35 F.  It fills an omission in the law by specifying that an out-of-state manufacturer that is 
36 sponsored by a certificate of approval holder, wholesale licensee or spirits supplier to 
37 participate in a taste-testing event may provide for taste testing any spirits, wine or malt 
38 liquor produced by the sponsored manufacturer, even though those products are not 
39 currently listed for sale in the State.
40 G.  It moves the statutory language granting licensed Maine liquor manufacturers the 
41 authority to sell their products at certain taste-testing events from the manufacturer 
42 licensing statute to the relevant taste-testing event statute for clarity and grants small 
43 distilleries new authority to self-distribute their spirits products for sale at these taste-
44 testing events.
Page 98 - 130LR0452(01)1 H.  It restricts the types of individuals who may receive partial-bottle samples of spirits 
2 or wine under statutes authorizing sampling by retail licensees to the owner and 
3 supervisory or managerial employees of the retail licensee.  This restriction exists in 
4 current law only for the receipt of partial-bottle samples of spirits by employees of 
5 agency liquor stores.
6 20.  It corrects an error in current law that suggests on-premises retail licenses are 
7 issued to international air terminals and instead specifies that on-premises retail licenses 
8 may be issued to qualified establishments located within international air terminals.
9 21.  It streamlines the process for disposal of spirits subject to a court's forfeiture order 
10 by newly authorizing the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
11 Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations or a wholesale spirits provider to choose, 
12 without obtaining an additional court order, to destroy the forfeited spirits rather than to 
13 restock and resell the forfeited spirits in agency liquor stores.
14 22.  It makes a number of changes to the State's laws governing the administration and 
15 sale of spirits in the State to address errors and inconsistencies in those laws, including the 
16 following.
17 A.  It amends conflicting provisions of law regarding the pricing of spirits to clarify 
18 that, as is current practice, the State Liquor and Lottery Commission establishes the 
19 retail price of spirits and the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
20 Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations establishes the wholesale price 
21 of spirits, which is the price that agency liquor stores pay to purchase spirits from the 
22 bureau.  It makes it clear that the bureau makes recommendations to the commission 
23 regarding the retail price of spirits sold in the State before the bureau establishes the 
24 wholesale price.
25 B.  It resolves a conflict in the laws governing the purchase of spirits by removing 
26 statutory language suggesting that agency liquor stores may purchase spirits from a 
27 wholesale spirits provider and retaining provisions of law correctly stating that agency 
28 liquor stores purchase spirits only from the bureau.
29 C.  It amends statutory provisions incorrectly suggesting that any agency liquor store 
30 may sell or deliver spirits to on-premises retailers and clarifies that only agency liquor 
31 stores that are licensed as reselling agents may make these sales and deliveries.
32 23.  It makes a number of additional changes to Title 28-A, section 1355-A, the statute 
33 governing the licensure of Maine liquor manufacturers, including the following.
34 A.  It restores the statutory authority of Maine bottlers and rectifiers to obtain licenses, 
35 which authority was unintentionally repealed through Public Law 2019, chapter 529.  
36 It also newly specifies the types of sampling activities that may occur on the premises 
37 of a licensed Maine bottler or rectifier under current practice.
38 B.  It combines in one location several scattered provisions describing the authority of 
39 licensed Maine breweries, small breweries, wineries, small wineries, distilleries and 
40 small distilleries, at the manufacturing facility where their products are produced, to 
41 sell samples of those products to the public or offer samples of those products to the 
42 public at no cost.  It newly clarifies that samples may not be served to minors or visibly 
43 intoxicated persons and that the area of the manufacturing facility where these samples 
Page 99 - 130LR0452(01)44 are sold or offered need not be separate from and may be accessed by the same entrance 
45 as the area of the manufacturing facility that is licensed for on-premises retail sales.
3 C.  It combines in one location several scattered provisions describing the authority of 
4 licensed Maine breweries, small breweries, wineries, small wineries, distilleries and 
5 small distilleries, at the manufacturing facility where their products are produced, to 
6 sell their products for off-premises consumption.
7 D.  It moves the provision authorizing Maine breweries and small breweries to sell malt 
8 liquor for off-premises consumption in kegs from a generally applicable subsection of 
9 the statute to the subsection of the statute specifically applicable to breweries and small 
10 breweries.
11 E.  It moves the provision requiring Maine small breweries and small wineries to keep 
12 and maintain records of their sales to retail licensees from a generally applicable 
13 subsection of the statute to the 2 subsections of the statute specifically applicable to 
14 small breweries and to small wineries.
15 F.  It clarifies that, as is current practice, when calculating whether a licensed Maine 
16 manufacturing facility's one statutorily authorized establishment for on-premises sales 
17 has satisfied any applicable statutory requirement that 10% of its gross annual income 
18 be from the sale of food, income from the Maine manufacturer's sale of liquor samples 
19 or sale of liquor for off-premises consumption is not included.
20 G.  It clarifies the language of the provision authorizing each licensed Maine brewery, 
21 small brewery, winery, small winery, distillery and small distillery to obtain one license 
22 to conduct on-premises retail sales per licensed manufacturing facility.  It also relaxes 
23 the requirements applicable when a distillery or small distillery obtains this type of on-
24 premises retail license by eliminating the requirements that the on-premises retail 
25 establishment be a Class A restaurant or Class A restaurant/lounge owned by the same 
26 person who owns the distillery or small distillery.  Instead, under the bill a distillery or 
27 small distillery may obtain any type of on-premises retail license as long as the same 
28 person or persons holds a majority ownership interest in the on-premises retail license 
29 and the distillery or small distillery.  These relaxed requirements match the 
30 requirements applicable under current law when a licensed brewery, small brewery, 
31 winery or small winery obtains this type of on-premises retail license.
32 H.  It newly authorizes a licensed Maine manufacturer that has its one statutorily 
33 authorized licensed establishment for on-premises sales at a location separate from its 
34 manufacturing facility to conduct sales of its products for off-premises consumption at 
35 that separate licensed location.  Under current law, a Maine manufacturer may conduct 
36 sales of its products for off-premises consumption at its one licensed establishment for 
37 on-premises sales only if the on-premises establishment is located at the manufacturing 
38 facility.  Similarly, the bill newly specifies that the products that may be sold for off-
39 premises consumption at the separate licensed location include, when the licensed 
40 Maine manufacturer is a brewery or a small brewery, malt liquor packaged in refillable 
41 containers, commonly referred to as growlers.  Under current law, a brewery or small 
42 brewery may sell growlers at its one licensed establishment for on-premises sales only 
43 if that on-premises establishment is located at the brewery or small brewery.
44 I.  It resolves a conflict in current law and conforms the law to current practice by 
45 specifying that, when a small distillery serves samples of its products at its 1
2
Page 100 - 130LR0452(01)46 manufacturing facility, it need not first send those products through the State's spirits 
47 warehouse and distribution system.
3 J.  It clarifies an ambiguity in the law by explicitly stating that a licensed Maine small 
4 winery, which may under current law obtain licenses to conduct off-premises retail 
5 sales at up to 2 additional locations other than the manufacturing facility, must pay a 
6 $50 license fee for each of those additional locations.  It similarly clarifies that a 
7 licensed small distillery, which may under current law also obtain licenses to conduct 
8 off-premises retail sales at up to 2 additional locations other than the manufacturing 
9 facility, must pay a $100 license fee for each of those additional locations.
10 K.  It corrects an omission in the law and matches current practice by specifying that a 
11 tenant brewery or tenant winery seeking licensure may pay the reduced license fee for 
12 a small brewery or small winery if it qualifies as a small brewery or small winery.  
13 Otherwise, the tenant brewery or tenant winery must pay the higher brewery or winery 
14 license fee.
15 24.  It reorganizes, clarifies and removes inconsistencies in the laws governing the 
16 importation of liquor into and the transportation of liquor within the State.  It clarifies that 
17 wineries, small wineries and tenant wineries may import spirits or purchase spirits 
18 manufactured in the State for the purpose of producing fortified wine and that breweries, 
19 small breweries and tenant breweries may import spirits or purchase spirits manufactured 
20 in the State for the purpose of producing low-alcohol spirits products containing malt 
21 liquor.  It also changes the units of measurement applicable to spirits and wine in these 
22 provisions from quarts and gallons to liters, which is the unit of measurement typically 
23 used when referring to spirits and wine products, and it changes the unit of measurement 
24 applicable to malt liquor from gallons to fluid ounces, which is the unit of measurement 
25 typically used when referring to malt liquor products.
26 25.  It corrects scattered typographical, cross-reference and drafting errors in the Title, 
27 including by removing all gendered pronouns as required by Public Law 2019, chapter 475, 
28 section 52.1
