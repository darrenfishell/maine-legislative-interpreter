Page 1 - 130LR0185(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §651, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2019, c. 82, §1 and c. 340, 
3 §5, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
42.  Application.  The parties wishing to record notice of their intentions of marriage 
5 shall submit an application for recording notice of their intentions of marriage.  The 
6 application may be issued to any 2 persons otherwise qualified under this chapter regardless 
7 of the sex of each person if the clerk or State Registrar of Vital Statistics is satisfied as to 
8 the identity of the applicants.  The application must include a signed certification that the 
9 information recorded on the application is correct and that the applicant is free to marry 
10 according to the laws of this State.  If either party intends to change that party's name upon 
11 marriage, the application must include the proposed new name of that party.  The 
12 applicant's signature must be acknowledged before an official authorized to take oaths.  An 
13 application recording notice of intention to marry is not open for public inspection for 50 
14 years from the date of the application except that:
15 A.  The names of the parties for whom intentions to marry are filed and the intended 
16 date of marriage are public records and open for public inspection; and
17 B.  A person with a researcher identification card under Title 22, section 2706, 
18 subsection 8 is permitted to inspect records and may be issued a noncertified copy of 
19 an application.
20Sec. 2.  19-A MRSA §656, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and 
21 affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:
222.  Completed license; ceremony performed.  Each marriage license issued must be 
23 completed and the certification statement signed by both parties to the intended marriage.  
24 The parties' signatures may be obtained at issuance or at the time the marriage is 
25 solemnized.  The completed license or licenses must be delivered by the parties to the 
26 person solemnizing the marriage.  Upon completion of the solemnization, which must be 
27 performed in the presence of at least 2 witnesses other than the person officiating, the 
28 person officiating and the 2 witnesses shall sign the license or licenses, which are then 
29 known as the marriage certificate or certificates.
30Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §2703, as amended by PL 2011, c. 511, §3, is further amended to 
31 read:
32§2703.  Birth, marriage or death in unincorporated place
33 When a birth, marriage or death occurs in an unincorporated place, it must be reported 
34 to a municipal clerk as specified by the state registrar and must be recorded, or registered 
35 in the electronic birth registration system, by the municipal clerk to whom the report is 
36 made.  All such reports and records must be forwarded to the state registrar.
37Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §2705, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2017, c. 5, §1, is further 
38 amended to read:
396.  Amendment of birth certificate of adult.  Amendment of a birth certificate of a 
40 person 18 years of age or older born in this State for the purpose of identifying or replacing 
41 a biological parent who was not known or listed at the time of birth is governed by section 
42 2767‑A.
Page 2 - 130LR0185(01)1Sec. 5.  22 MRSA §2767-A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 5, §3, is amended to read:
2§2767-A.  Amendment of birth certificate of adult
31.  Amendment of birth certificate.  The State Registrar of Vital Statistics shall amend 
4 the birth certificate of a person 18 years of age or older born in this State for the purpose 
5 of identifying or replacing a genetic parent who was not known or listed at the time of birth 
6 when the state registrar has received the following:
7 A.  A signed, notarized request from the subject of the birth certificate that the birth 
8 certificate be amended;
9 B.  Either the written, notarized consent of the genetic parent to be named on the 
10 amended birth certificate or a certified copy of the death certificate of the genetic parent 
11 to be named on the amended birth certificate; and
12 C.  Evidence of genetic parentage based on testing of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, that 
13 includes:
14 (1)  A notarized report of the results of the DNA testing; and
15 (2)  Notarized documentation of the chain of custody of the blood and tissue 
16 samples examined in the testing.
17 The testing must be of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation 
18 bodies designated by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it must 
19 be performed by a laboratory approved by an accreditation body designated by the 
20 federal Secretary of Health and Human Services.
212.  Effect.  If the request submitted pursuant to subsection 1 does not contain the 
22 written, notarized consent of the genetic parent to be named on the amended birth 
23 certificate, amendment of the birth certificate pursuant to this section does not affect the 
24 rights of inheritance and descent.  A birth certificate amended without the written, notarized 
25 consent of the genetic parent to be named on the amended birth certificate must contain the 
26 following words in a conspicuous place: "This birth certificate has been amended to 
27 identify or replace a genetic parent not known or listed at the time of birth.  This amendment 
28 does not affect the rights of inheritance or descent of the subject of the birth certificate."
29SUMMARY
30 This bill amends the laws regulating certificates of birth, marriage and death.  It 
31 clarifies that the signatures on a marriage license of the parties to the intended marriage 
32 may be obtained at the issuance of the license or at the time the marriage is solemnized.  It 
33 requires that when a death or marriage occurs in an unincorporated place, it must be 
34 recorded or registered in the electronic registration system.  It also clarifies that a birth 
35 certificate may be amended by the replacement of a genetic parent. 
36 The bill also corrects a conflict created by Public Law 2019, chapters 82 and 340, which 
37 affected the same provision of law, by incorporating the changes made by both laws.
