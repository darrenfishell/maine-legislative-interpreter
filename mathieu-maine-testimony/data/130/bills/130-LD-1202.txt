20CHAPTER 36-A
21WOOD-FIRED COMBINED HEAT AND POWER ACT
22§3621.  Short title
23 This chapter may be known and cited as "the Wood-fired Combined Heat and Power 
24 Act."
25§3622.  Definitions
26 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
27 have the following meanings.
281.  Combined heat and power project.  "Combined heat and power project" means a 
29 facility that uses wood fuel to generate electric heat and power that is used for industrial or 
30 space heating purposes.
312.  Net generating capacity.  "Net generating capacity" means the electric output of 
32 an electricity generating facility delivered to the transmission and distribution utility 
33 system.  "Net generating capacity" does not include any energy consumed by the generator 
34 to operate the electricity generating facility or any energy consumed for facility lighting, 
35 power and auxiliary facilities.
363.  Program participant.  "Program participant" means a combined heat and power 
37 project that is participating in the combined heat and power program established in section 
38 3623.
Page 2 - 130LR1542(01)14.  Wood fuel.  "Wood fuel" means wood residue from wood product manufacturing 
2 or other biomass derived from trees and other woody plants that were grown or processed 
3 domestically.
4§3623.  Combined heat and power program
51.  Program established.  The combined heat and power program, referred to in this 
6 chapter as "the program," is established to encourage the development in the State of 
7 combined heat and power projects.  The program is administered by the commission.
82.  Program scope; limits on net generating capacity.  The commission shall limit 
9 participation in the program in accordance with this subsection.
10 A.  The net generating capacity of a program participant may not be less than 3 
11 megawatts or more than 10 megawatts.
12 B.  The total net generating capacity of all program participants combined may not 
13 exceed 50 megawatts.
14 The commission may modify the amount of total net generating capacity stipulated 
15 under this paragraph based on program experience.
163.  Program eligibility criteria.  To be eligible to participate in the program, a 
17 combined heat and power project must:
18 A.  Be connected to the electric grid of this State;

31 participants located within the service territory of the utility for energy, capacity resources 
32 or renewable energy credits.  The commission may direct investor-owned transmission and 
33 distribution utilities to enter into contracts under this subsection only as agents for their 
34 customers and only in accordance with this section.  An investor-owned transmission and 
35 distribution utility shall sell energy, capacity resources or renewable energy credits

37 action relative to such energy, capacity resources or renewable energy credits as directed 
38 by the commission.
392.  Consumer-owned transmission and distribution utilities; voluntary 
40participation.  A consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility may, at the option 
41 of the utility, enter into long-term contracts with one or more program participants located 
42 within the service territory of the utility for energy, capacity resources or renewable energy 
Page 3 - 130LR1542(01)43 credits.  Consumer-owned transmission and distribution utilities may enter into contracts 
44 under this subsection only as agents for their customers and only in accordance with this

7 supply bids under section 3212 or solicitations for green power offer bids under section 
8 3212-A.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures for long-
9 term contracts for transmission and distribution utilities under this section having the same 
10 legal and financial effect as the procedures used for standard-offer service pursuant to 
11 section 3212 for transmission and distribution utilities.
124.  Contract term.  A contract entered into pursuant to this section may not be for 
13 more than 20 years.
145.  Contract pricing; cost containment.  The commission shall establish a contract

18 section 3209-B, in the year the contract price is established plus annual cost escalators 
19 adopted by the commission.
206.  Cost and benefit allocation.  The commission shall ensure that all costs and

37 2022, and biennially thereafter, shall report to the joint standing committee of the 
38 Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters on the program and the 
39 development of combined heat and power projects.  The report must include, but is not

16 or to lease publicly owned land, water or facilities to other qualifying owners for the 
17 development and operation of a combined heat and power project.
18SUMMARY
19 This bill establishes the combined heat and power program, administered by the Public 
20 Utilities Commission, to encourage the sustainable development of combined heat and 
21 power projects that use wood fuel in the State.  Participation in the program is limited to 
22 50 megawatts of net generating capacity across all projects, and each individual project 
23 may not be less than 3 megawatts or more than 10 megawatts of net generating capacity.
24 The bill authorizes the commission to direct investor-owned transmission and 
25 distribution utilities to enter into long-term contracts with program participants located 
26 within the service territory of each utility for energy, capacity resources or renewable 
27 energy credits.  A long-term contract entered into under the combined heat and power 
28 program cannot be for a contract term greater than 20 years, and the contract price may not 
29 exceed the tariff rate established by the commission for commercial and institutional net 
30 energy billing projects in the year the contract price is established, plus annual cost 
31 escalators adopted by the commission.  It allows consumer-owned transmission and 
32 distribution utilities, at their own option, to enter into such contracts.  It also requires the 
33 commission to ensure that mechanisms are established to protect electricity ratepayers over 
34 the contract term.
35 It requires the commission to report biennially to the joint standing committee of the 
36 Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters regarding the 
37 implementation and effectiveness of the combined heat and power program and the overall 
38 development of combined heat and power program projects in the State.
39 Lastly, it authorizes, but does not require, the State to give preference to electricity 
40 generated by combined heat and power projects when purchasing electricity for the State 
41 and authorizes, but does not require, the commission to incorporate energy generated by 
42 combined heat and power projects into the supply of standard-offer service.1
