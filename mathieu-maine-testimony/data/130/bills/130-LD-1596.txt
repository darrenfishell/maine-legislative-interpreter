19 3209-A, subsection 4 and is subject to a contract entered into prior to January 1, 2021 may 
20 continue to qualify for net energy billing if the Public Utilities Commission determines 
21 there is sufficient viability of the project based upon developer investment and the 
22 achievement of project development milestones under Title 35-A, section 3484, subsection 
23 7.
24SUMMARY
25 This bill reduces the nameplate capacity of a distributed generation resource project 
26 that qualifies for net energy billing from less than 5 megawatts to less than one megawatt, 
27 and allows a project subject to a contract entered into prior to January 1, 2021 that 
28 previously qualified for net energy billing and no longer qualifies upon the enactment of 
29 this provision to continue to qualify for net energy billing as determined by the Public 
30 Utilities Commission based upon the project's viability as indicated by developer 
31 investment and achievement of project milestones.  This bill decreases tariff rates for 
32 customers participating in the net energy billing program for commercial and institutional 
33 customers of investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities from the standard offer 
34 service rate plus 75% of the transmission and distribution rate for the class of the smallest 
35 customers of the utility in annual incremental reductions until arriving at the standard offer 
36 service rate after 5 years.  It also reduces the time in which a customer participating in the 
37 program may receive the bill credit from 20 years to 10 years.  This bill also directs the 
38 Public Utilities Commission to offer buyouts to commercial or institutional customers of 
39 transmission and distribution utilities who have a shared financial interest in a distributed 
40 generation resource project who have not yet started commercial operations on the effective 
41 date of this bill.25
