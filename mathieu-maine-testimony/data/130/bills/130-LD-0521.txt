14 and procedures for jails.  The standards, policies and procedures must be established by

16 best practices for the administration and operation of jails.  The rules must include policies 
17 and procedures for assisting jails to achieve compliance and for imposing penalties for 
18 noncompliance.
19 A.  The standards, policies and procedures must address record keeping and reporting

25 B.  In administering and distributing funding to the jails pursuant to section 1210‑D, 
26 subsection 4, the commissioner shall:
27 (1)  Require reporting of data that indicates average daily population of prisoners, 
28 that excludes federal prisoners, that indicates sending and receiving jails for 
29 transferred prisoners and that is useful in calculating the distributions to the 
30 counties pursuant to section 1210‑D, subsection 4; and
31 (2)  Consider the performance of each jail in meeting the standards established 
32 pursuant to this section.  The commissioner shall work with the jails to assist them 
33 in achieving compliance with the standards.  The commissioner shall enforce the 
34 standards by imposition of monetary penalties upon a county for noncompliance 
35 by the county jail or regional jail.  A monetary penalty imposed under this

37 distribution payable to a county for a fiscal year pursuant to section 1210-D, 
38 subsection 4.
392.  Rulemaking.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as
