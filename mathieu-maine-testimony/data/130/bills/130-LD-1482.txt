11 homestead of a permanent resident of this State who has owned a homestead in this State 
12 for the preceding 12 months is exempt from taxation.  Beginning with property tax years 
13 beginning on or after April 1, 2022, except for assessments for special benefits, the just 
14 value of $10,000 of the homestead of a permanent resident of this State is exempt from

18 deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be determined ineligible 
19 for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of the homestead by the

21 multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current just value upon which the 
22 assessment is based as furnished in the assessor's annual return pursuant to section 383.  If 
23 the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in common with others, the 
24 exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the homestead, but may be 
25 apportioned among the owners who reside on the property to the extent of their respective 
26 interests.  A municipality responsible for administering the homestead exemption has no 
27 obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest in a homestead owned jointly 
28 or in common.

2 This bill removes the requirement that a person own a homestead in this State for 12 
3 months before being eligible for the homestead property tax exemption. This bill also 
4 requires the State to provide reimbursement of 100% of the revenue lost by a municipality 
5 due to removing that 12-month requirement, but only for the first year of eligibility.  If a 
6 resident is eligible for the homestead exemption but does not take it until after the first year 
7 of eligibility, that exemption is eligible only for 70% reimbursement by the State.  After 
8 the first year of eligibility, the state reimbursement rate drops to the current rate of 70%.2
