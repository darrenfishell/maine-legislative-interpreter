Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill adds to existing greenhouse gas emissions goals to also require that, beginning January 1, 2045, net annual 
greenhouse gas emissions in the State may not exceed zero metric tons. While this new goal does not require 
additional funding at this time, future legislation taking specific actions to meet this and other goals may require 
additional funding.
