25SUMMARY
26  This bill amends the Maine Uniform Accounting and Auditing Practices Act for 
27 Community Agencies.  It replaces an outdated reference to federal Office of Management 
28 and Budget Circular A-133 by referring to uniform guidance under 2 Code of Federal 
29 Regulations, Part 200.  It updates the dollar thresholds for reporting to conform with that 
30 guidance.  It also repeals provisions establishing the Advisory Committee to the 
31 Commissioner and requiring reporting to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
32 having jurisdiction over state and local government matters on the implementation of the 
33 law.
