Page 1 - 130LR1891(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §685-B, sub-§1-A, ¶B-2, as reallocated by RR 2011, c. 2, §8 
3 and affected by §10, is repealed.
4Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2866, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §6 and affected 
5 by §33, is repealed.
6Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §351, 2nd ¶, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 653, §9 and affected by 
7 §33, is repealed.
8Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §352, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §10 and affected 
9 by §33 and amended by c. 657, Pt. W, §5, is further amended to read:
103.  Maximum fee.  The commissioner shall set the actual fees and shall publish a 
11 schedule of all fees by November 1st of each year.  If the commissioner determines that a 
12 particular application, by virtue of its size, uniqueness, complexity or other relevant factors, 
13 is likely to require significantly more costs than those listed on Table I, the commissioner 
14 may designate that application as subject to special fees.  Such a designation must be made 
15 at, or prior to, the time the application is accepted as complete and may not be based solely 
16 on the likelihood of extensive public controversy.  The maximum fee for processing an 
17 application may not exceed $250,000, except that the maximum fee for processing an 
18 application under chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 9 is as provided for in subsection 4‑A.  
19 All staff of the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the 
20 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Marine 
21 Resources who have worked on the review of the application, including, but not limited to, 
22 preapplication consultations, shall submit quarterly reports to the commissioner detailing 
23 the time spent on the application and all expenses attributable to the application, including 
24 the costs of any appeals filed by the applicant and, after taking into consideration the 
25 interest of fairness and equity, any other appeals if the commissioner finds it in the public 
26 interest to do so.  Any appeal filed by the applicant of an application fee must be to the 
27 agency of jurisdiction of the application.  The costs associated with assistance to the board 
28 on an appeal before the board may be separately charged.  The processing fee for that 
29 application must be the actual cost to the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries 
30 and Wildlife, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the 
31 Department of Marine Resources.  The processing fee must be distributed to each 
32 department that incurs a cost to be deposited in the account in which the expenses were 
33 incurred in that department to reimburse the actual cost to that department.  The applicant 
34 must be billed quarterly and all fees paid prior to receipt of the permit.  At the time of the 
35 quarterly billing by the department, the commissioner shall review the ongoing work of the 
36 department to identify, prevent and mitigate undue delays or vague requirements of the 
37 application processing.  Nothing in this section limits the commissioner's authority to enter 
38 into an agreement with an applicant for payment of costs in excess of the maximum fee 
39 established in this subsection.
40Sec. 5.  38 MRSA §352, sub-§4-A, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 653, 
41 §11 and affected by §33, is repealed.
42Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §353, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §13 and affected 
43 by §33, is further amended to read:
Page 2 - 130LR1891(01)12.  Processing fee.  Except for annual air emission fees pursuant to section 353‑A and 
2 annual waste discharge fees pursuant to section 353‑B, a processing fee must be paid at the 
3 time of filing the application.  Failure to pay the processing fee at the time of filing the 
4 application results in the application being returned to the applicant. One-half the 
5 processing fee assessed in section 352, subsection 5‑A for licenses issued for a 10-year 
6 term must be paid at the time of filing the application.  The remaining 1/2 of the processing 
7 fee for licenses issued for a 10-year term must be paid 5 years after issuance of the license.  
8 The commissioner may not refund the processing fee if the application is denied by the 
9 board or the commissioner. Except as provided in section 352, subsection 4‑A, if If the 
10 application is withdrawn by the applicant within 30 days of the start of processing, the 
11 portion of the processing fee that was expended or committed by the department or the 
12 department's agents or contractors for the cost of processing the application prior to the 
13 withdrawal of the application must be calculated, and the remainder of the processing fee 
14 not expended or committed must be refunded.
15Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §420-D, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §14 and 
16 affected by §33, is further amended to read:
175.  Relationship to other laws.  A storm water permit pursuant to this section is not 
18 required for a project requiring review by the department pursuant to any of the following 
19 provisions but the project may be required to meet standards for management of storm 
20 water adopted pursuant to this section:  article 6, site location of development; article 7, 
21 performance standards for excavations for borrow, clay, topsoil or silt; article 8-A, 
22 performance standards for quarries; article 9, the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act; 
23 sections 631 to 636, permits for hydropower projects; and section 1310-N, 1319-R or 
24 1319-X, waste facility licenses.  When a project requires a storm water permit and requires 
25 review pursuant to article 5-A, the department shall issue a joint order unless the permit 
26 required pursuant to article 5-A is a permit-by-rule or general permit, or separate orders are 
27 requested by the applicant and approved by the department.
28 A storm water permit pursuant to this section is not required for a project receiving review 
29 by a registered municipality pursuant to section 489‑A if the storm water ordinances under 
30 which the project is reviewed are at least as stringent as the storm water standards adopted 
31 pursuant to section 484 or if the municipality meets the requirements of section 489‑A, 
32 subsection 2‑A, paragraph B.
33Sec. 8.  38 MRSA §480-D, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §15 and 
34 affected by §33, is further amended to read:
353.  Harm to habitats; fisheries.  The activity will not unreasonably harm any 
36 significant wildlife habitat, freshwater wetland plant habitat, threatened or endangered 
37 plant habitat, aquatic or adjacent upland habitat, travel corridor, freshwater, estuarine or 
38 marine fisheries or other aquatic life.
39 In determining whether mining, as defined in section 490‑MM, subsection 11, will comply 
40 with this subsection, the department shall review an analysis of alternatives submitted by 
41 the applicant.  For purposes of this subsection, a practicable alternative to mining, as 
42 defined in section 490‑MM, subsection 11, that is less damaging to the environment is not 
43 considered to exist.  The department may consider alternatives associated with the activity, 
44 including alternative design and operational measures, in its evaluation of whether the 
45 activity avoided and minimized impacts to the maximum extent practicable.
Page 3 - 130LR1891(01)1 In determining whether there is unreasonable harm to significant wildlife habitat, the 
2 department may consider proposed mitigation if that mitigation does not diminish in the 
3 vicinity of the proposed activity the overall value of significant wildlife habitat and species 
4 utilization of the habitat and if there is no specific biological or physical feature unique to 
5 the habitat that would be adversely affected by the proposed activity.  For purposes of this 
6 subsection, "mitigation" means any action taken or not taken to avoid, minimize, rectify, 
7 reduce, eliminate or compensate for any actual or potential adverse impact on the 
8 significant wildlife habitat, including the following:
9 A.  Avoiding an impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
10 B.  Minimizing an impact by limiting the magnitude, duration or location of an activity 
11 or by controlling the timing of an activity;
12 C.  Rectifying an impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected 
13 environment;
14 D.  Reducing or eliminating an impact over time through preservation and maintenance 
15 operations during the life of the project; or
16 E.  Compensating for an impact by replacing the affected significant wildlife habitat.
17Sec. 9.  38 MRSA c. 3, sub-c. 1, art. 9, as amended, is repealed.
18Sec. 10.  38 MRSA c. 3, sub-c. 1, art. 10 is enacted to read:
