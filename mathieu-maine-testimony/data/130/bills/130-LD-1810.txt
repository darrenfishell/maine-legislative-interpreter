20 The passing grade on any examination is established by the national council.  An 
21 applicant who fails to complete the application process within 5 years must reapply to the 
22 board, meet qualification requirements that are in effect at the time of the new application 
23 and present 3 new references and updated documentation of engineering work experience.
24SUMMARY
25 This bill moves from the section of law related to examinations to the section related 
26 to applications the requirement that an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer or 
27 certification as an engineer-intern reapply if the application process is not completed within 
28 5 years and updates language to clarify the requirement. It also removes the requirement 
29 that the application form must be furnished by the State Board of Licensure for Professional 
30 Engineers. The bill also eliminates the requirement that an applicant complete a period of 
31 mandated engineering work experience before the applicant is allowed to sit for the 
32 principles and practices of engineering examinations. 25
