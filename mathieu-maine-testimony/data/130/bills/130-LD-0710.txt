24 suspension with a period of probation not to exceed the maximum period authorized for 
25 the crime, to commence on the date the individual goes into actual execution of the 
26 sentence. That day is counted as the first full day of the period of probation.

31 filing of the written notice with the court that the person cannot be located or the arrest of 
32 the person.  If the court finds a violation of probation, the day upon which the tolling occurs 
33 does not count toward the period of probation.  If the motion is dismissed or withdrawn, or 
34 if the court finds no violation of probation, the running of the period of probation is deemed 
35 not to have been tolled.  The conditions of probation continue in effect during the tolling 
36 of the running of the period of probation, and any violation of a condition subjects the 
37 person to a revocation of probation pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.

22SUMMARY
23 This bill contains the following provisions.
24 1.  In Part A it amends the crime of endangering the welfare of a child by enacting in 
25 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph D a new Class 
26 C crime for the reckless violation of a duty of care or protection that results in death or 
27 serious bodily injury to the child.  It amends the crime of endangering the welfare of a child 
28 under Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph C to cover recklessly violating a 
29 duty of care or protection.
30 2.  In Part B it amends the crime of gross sexual assault against a person under 12 years 
31 of age or a person under 14 years of age, both of which are Class A crimes, by requiring 
32 that the actor be at least 3 years older than the other person.
33 3.  In Part C it amends Title 15, section 393 to recognize that convictions in the tribal 
34 courts of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation are disqualifying domestic 
35 violence convictions for the purposes of the prohibition against firearms created by Title 
36 15, section 393, subsection 1-B.  It makes Title 15, section 393 more consistent with the 
37 Maine Criminal Code by using the phrase "another jurisdiction" to reference the courts 
38 defined by that term.
39 4.  In Part D, in response to State v. LeBlanc-Simpson, 2018 ME 109, it clarifies that a 
40 judicial officer in issuing a written release order under Title 15, section 1026, subsection 
41 2-A or 3 must inform a defendant of the conditions of release, that the conditions take effect 23
Page 7 - 130LR0390(01)42 and are fully enforceable immediately and that failure to appear or comply with conditions 
43 may result in revocation of bail and additional criminal penalties.  The bill provides that a 
44 condition of release takes effect and is fully enforceable immediately as of the time the 
45 judicial officer sets the condition, unless the release order expressly excludes a condition 
46 of release from immediate applicability, if the defendant is advised of the conditions and 
47 that failure to appear or comply with the conditions may subject the defendant to revocation 
48 of bail and additional criminal penalties.  This bill provides that the notice required in order 
49 for a condition of release to take effect immediately may be provided by a judicial officer, 
50 a law enforcement officer or an employee of a county or regional jail or a correctional 
51 facility having custody of the defendant.
11 5.  In Part E it amends the laws governing probation to reflect the current practice of 
12 the Department of Corrections with respect to calculating the period of probation.  A 
13 probationer receives credit for a full day of probation on the day probation commences, 
14 regardless of the time of day, and receives no credit for a day on which probation is tolled.  
15 The period of probation ends when the final day of the probation period ends.
16 6.  In Part F it amends the law to respond to the issue identified by the Law Court in 
17 State v. Asaad, (2020 ME 11), specifically the absence of a mens rea requirement in the 
18 Class C crime of gross sexual assault under Title 17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph 
19 M.  The bill requires the State to prove, as an element of that crime of gross sexual assault, 
20 that the defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct knowing that the other person had not 
21 expressly or impliedly acquiesced.  The same "knowing" culpable mental state element is 
22 proposed for one of the Class C crimes of unlawful sexual contact, one of the Class D 
23 crimes of unlawful sexual contact and one of the Class D crimes of unlawful sexual 
24 touching.1
