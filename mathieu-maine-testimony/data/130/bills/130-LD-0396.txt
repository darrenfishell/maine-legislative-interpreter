32-A.  No removal for economic deprivation.  Ensure that children will not be 
4 removed from the custody of their parents by the department if the jeopardy to health or 
5 welfare is evidenced only by deprivation of adequate food, clothing, shelter or necessary

14SUMMARY
15 This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide assistance 
16 with applying for basic necessities if a child is at risk of being removed from the home 
17 solely due to the parents having insufficient income and resources to provide those 
18 necessities and stipulates in law that the Legislature intends that children may not be 
19 removed from the custody of the parents solely due to economic deprivation.
