Page 1 - 130LR1688(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1555-B, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 308, §6, is further 
3 amended to read:
42.  Sales to persons who have not attained 21 years of age prohibited.  A person 
5 may not sell, furnish, give away or offer to sell, furnish or give away a tobacco product to 
6 any person who has not attained 21 years of age, unless the person has attained 18 years of 
7 age as of July 1, 2018.  Tobacco products may not be sold at retail to any person who has 
8 not attained 30 years of age unless the seller first verifies that person's age by means of 
9 reliable photographic identification containing the person's date of birth  examining and 
10 scanning a government-issued photographic identification using a scanning technology or 
11 other automated, software-based system.  That a person appeared to be 30 years of age or 
12 older does not constitute a defense to a violation of this section.
13Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §1560-B, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 288, §1, is repealed 
14 and the following enacted in its place:
152.  Prohibition.  The following acts are prohibited.
16 A.  Beginning January 1, 2016, a person may not sell, furnish, give away or offer to 
17 sell, furnish or give away a nicotine liquid container unless the container is child-
18 resistant packaging.
19 B.  Beginning January 1, 2022, a person who sells electronic nicotine delivery devices 
20 or nicotine liquid containers at retail may not sell in a single transaction more than:
21 (1)  One electronic nicotine delivery device and 4 nicotine liquid containers;
22 (2)  One electronic nicotine delivery device and 4 cartridges or other containers 
23 that are sold separately from the device, contain a liquid or other substance 
24 containing nicotine and are prefilled and sealed by the manufacturer and not 
25 intended to be opened by the consumer; or
26 (3)  Four single-use electronic nicotine delivery devices that are prefilled and 
27 contain a liquid or other substance containing nicotine.
28SUMMARY
29 This bill amends the law governing the age verification requirement for sales of tobacco 
30 products.  It also establishes limits on the number of electronic nicotine delivery devices 
31 and nicotine liquid containers that may be sold in a single transaction.29
