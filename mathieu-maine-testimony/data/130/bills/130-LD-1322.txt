Page 1 - 130LR1540(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the State is currently in a prolonged state of emergency in which a global 
4 pandemic has caused widespread unemployment; and
5Whereas, thousands of renters statewide who have become unemployed through no 
6 fault of their own have been unable to meet their rental commitments to their landlords; 
7 and
8Whereas, many landlords in the State have not received rent from their unemployed 
9 tenants, causing hardship and the inability to pay utilities, bills and mortgage payments; 
10 and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14 therefore, be it
15Sec. 1.  Maine State Housing Authority to allow rental housing owners to 
16apply for emergency rental relief assistance. Resolved:  That the Maine State 
17 Housing Authority shall allow rental housing owners to apply for emergency rental relief 
18 assistance from the emergency rental assistance program funded by the United States 
19 Department of the Treasury in response to the coronavirus disease 2019, also known as 
20 COVID-19, and the related pandemic.  A rental housing owner who has experienced lost 
21 rental income due to the COVID-19 pandemic may apply for emergency rental relief 
22 assistance on behalf of a tenant of the rental housing owner who is not current on the 
23 tenant's rent and is unwilling or unable to apply for assistance under the program.  For 
24 purposes of this section, "lost rental income" does not include rent lawfully withheld or not 
25 paid by the tenant under the provisions of Title 14, chapter 710.  Intentionally falsifying 
26 lost rental income is a violation of the crime of theft by deception under the Maine Revised 
27 Statutes, Title 17-A, section 354.
28Sec. 2.  Retroactivity. Resolved:  That a housing rental owner may apply for 
29 emergency rental relief assistance under section 1 for lost rental income incurred on or after 
30 March 15, 2020.
31Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
32 takes effect when approved.
33SUMMARY
34 This resolve directs the Maine State Housing Authority to allow rental housing owners 
35 to apply for COVID-19 emergency rental relief assistance for lost rental revenue due to 
36 tenants who are not current on their rent and are unable or unwilling to apply for assistance 
37 on their own.34
