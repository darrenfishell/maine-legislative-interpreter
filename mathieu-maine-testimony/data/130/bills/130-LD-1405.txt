6SUMMARY
7 Part A of this bill authorizes the Department of Public Safety, Gambling Control Unit 
8 to regulate sports wagering in the State.
9 Licensed commercial tracks, licensed off-track betting facilities, including off-track 
10 betting facilities licensed under Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16, licensed slot 
11 machine facilities and casinos and federally recognized Indian tribes are eligible to apply 
12 for facility sports wagering licenses to conduct in-person sports wagering in the State. 
13 These entities are also eligible to apply for mobile sports wagering licenses to conduct 
14 sports wagering through mobile applications or digital platforms. Facility sports wagering 
15 licensees and mobile sports wagering licensees, referred to in the bill as operators, may 
16 purchase or lease equipment, systems or services for sports wagering from entities with a 
17 supplier license, whose equipment, systems or services must meet standards established by 
18 rule. Operators may also enter into written contracts, approved by the director of the 
19 Gambling Control Unit, with management services licensees that have sufficient 
20 knowledge and experience in the business of operating sports wagering to effectively 
21 conduct sports wagering on behalf of operators. A person employed by a facility sports 
22 wagering licensee to be engaged directly in sports wagering-related activities must be 
23 licensed by the Gambling Control Unit.
24 Operators may accept wagers on professional, collegiate and amateur sports events, 
25 including international events, as well as on the individual performances of athletes, on 
26 motor vehicle races and on electronic sports. Sports wagers are prohibited on high school 
27 events, other events where a majority of participants are under 18 years of age and events 
28 involving Maine-based colleges and universities. Operators may not accept sports wagers 
29 from individuals under 21 years of age; participants in the sports event, including athletes 
30 and officials; persons with an interest in the outcome of the sports event identified by the 
31 director by rule; the operator's own directors or employees or persons living in their 
32 households; persons voluntarily or involuntarily placed on a list maintained by the 
33 Gambling Control Unit of persons not authorized to make sports wagers; persons making 
34 wagers on behalf of another person; and Gambling Control Unit employees. Mobile sports 
35 wagering licensees are also prohibited from accepting sports wagers from persons who are 
36 not physically located within the State.
37 A facility sports wagering licensee must remit 10% of the licensee's adjusted gross 
38 sports wagering receipts to the State, and a mobile sports wagering licensee must remit 
39 16% of the licensee's adjusted gross sports wagering receipts to the State. One quarter of 
40 1% of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the General Fund 
41 for the administrative expenses of the Gambling Control Unit; 0.25% of the adjusted gross 
42 sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the Gambling Addiction Prevention and 
43 Treatment Fund; 0.55% of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be distributed 
44 by the State Harness Racing Commission to entities that conduct live harness racing in the 
45 State; 0.55% of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the Sire 1

Page 26 - 130LR0710(01)46 Stakes Fund; and 0.4% of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in 
47 the Agricultural Fair Promotion Fund established in the bill. The remaining adjusted gross 
48 sports wagering receipts remitted to the State must be deposited in the General Fund.
4 Part A of the bill also allows a licensed fantasy contest operator to offer a fantasy 
5 contest based on the performances of participants in collegiate athletic events.
6 Part B of the bill clarifies that although the process for issuance of off-track betting 
7 facility licenses under Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16 differed from the process 
8 for issuance of other off-track betting facility licenses in the State, the off-track betting 
9 facilities licensed under Public Law 2019, chapter 626, section 16 are subject to the same 
10 facility and operating requirements and restrictions, license renewal terms and fees and 
11 administrative oversight as other licensed off-track betting facilities. 
12 Part B of the bill also reduces by half the percentage of the commissions earned by off-
13 track betting facilities licensed before January 1, 2021 that are ineligible to receive 
14 distributions from the Fund to Stabilize Off-track Betting Facilities when they accept 
15 wagers on simulcasting of out-of-state races with commingled pools that are collected by 
16 the State to be distributed to various harness racing funds and entities but does not reduce 
17 the percentage of these commissions that are remitted to the General Fund.
