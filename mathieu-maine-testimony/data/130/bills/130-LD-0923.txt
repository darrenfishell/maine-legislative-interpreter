Page 1 - 130LR0823(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution asserts that the 
4 government "shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press"; and
5Whereas, freedom of the press in the United States is not absolute and is subject to 
6 certain restrictions; and
7Whereas, the State has a compelling interest to require the press to promote objective 
8 truth for the sake of the viability of democracy and to promote the safety, health and welfare 
9 of our communities; and
10Whereas, there has been a growing trend for individuals to use the courts to file 
11 spurious claims, which are selectively reported on by the media, to the detriment of the 
12 accused party; and
13Whereas, the pattern of media outlets failing to report on the ultimate outcome of 
14 cases has eroded the community's trust in the integrity of government institutions; and
15Whereas, the State has a compelling interest to promote the truth because without 
16 truth, there is no freedom; and
17Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
19 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
20 therefore,
21Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
22Sec. 1.  10 MRSA c. 232 is enacted to read:
23CHAPTER 232
24STOP GUILT BY ACCUSATION ACT
25§1500-M.  Short title
26 This chapter may be known and cited as "the Stop Guilt by Accusation Act."
27§1500-N.  Purpose
281.  Purpose.  The purpose of this Act is to:
29 A.  Prevent media outlets from engaging in defamation in kind and degrading the 
30 integrity of the State's institutions through selective reporting on cases or controversies, 
31 thereby cultivating false narratives that injure the accused by causing them to be subject 
32 to suspicion of wrongdoing by the general public;
33 B.  Protect the integrity of the press and encourage good character of the press;
34 C.  Deter malicious prosecution, abuse of process, overcharging by prosecutors and 
35 lawsuits seeking excessive relief; and
36 D.  Avoid condemnation of the accused by the general public.

2 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
3 have the following meanings.
41.  Abuse of process.  "Abuse of process" means the act of bringing a civil or criminal

6 purportedly intended, including proceedings brought for reasons other than those sought 
7 on the surface of the complaint.
82.  Accused.  "Accused" means a person, including a suspect, respondent or defendant,

16 statement of fact that is harmful to an individual's reputation and that is published 
17 negligently or with malice, arising from the failure of a media outlet to report on the 
18 outcome of a case or controversy after the media outlet reported on the initial filings in a 
19 case or controversy in which the petitioner received less relief than originally sought or 
20 could have obtained and that could reasonably place the accused in a false light that causes

31 view, taken of a suspect after the suspect is arrested for an alleged criminal violation with 
32 the purpose of creating a photographic record of the arrested individual and for 
33 identification of the suspect by victims and investigators.
349.  Petitioner.  "Petitioner" means a person or government entity, acting as a plaintiff, 
35 claimant or complainant, that presents a petition to a government authority with respect to

3 could have been obtained by the petitioner; and
4 B.  The accused or an authorized agent of the accused sends written notice to an

5SUMMARY
6 This bill creates the Stop Guilt by Accusation Act.  It requires media outlets, upon 
7 receiving a demand from an individual who is the defendant in a criminal or civil case, and 
8 about whom the media has previously reported, to publish, within 10 days of receipt of a 
9 demand, a follow-up to the original reporting in the event the final verdict or decision 
10 reached provided less relief to the petitioner in the case than sought by or that would have 
11 been obtained by the petitioner.  It provides a private right of action with a one-year statute 
12 of limitations for the accused in the event of noncompliance by the media outlet. It exempts 
13 from the Act satirical or humorous publications, documentary works and investigative 
14 reports and provides that an accused who is convicted of a felony charge as part of the case 
15 or controversy does not have standing under the Act.1
