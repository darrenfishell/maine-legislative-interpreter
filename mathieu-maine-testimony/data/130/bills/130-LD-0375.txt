5§441.  Removal of sheriff
61.  Complaint by county commissioners.  Whenever the county commissioners find 
7 that the sheriff is not faithfully or efficiently performing any duty imposed by this chapter 
8 or that the sheriff is improperly exercising or acting outside the sheriff's authority, such as 
9 gross deviation in ethical behavior or engaging in criminal conduct, the commissioners may 
10 file a complaint with the Governor describing in detail the facts of those actions or 
11 omissions and requesting that the Governor remove the sheriff from office and appoint 
12 another sheriff in that office for the remainder of the term.
132.  Requirements of complaint; filing.  The complaint filed under subsection 1 must 
14 name the accused sheriff, state the charges against the sheriff and be signed by a majority 
15 of the county commissioners.  The complaint must be filed with the Superior Court of the 
16 county in which the sheriff serves, and notice must be given to the sheriff.
173.  Court procedures.  Upon receipt of the complaint, the Superior Court shall 
18 schedule a hearing in which the county commissioners shall present their case to the court 
19 supported by one or more affidavits and any other evidence.  The sheriff may rebut the 
20 allegations and provide one or more affidavits and other evidence in defense against the 
21 complaint.  If the court finds sufficient cause, the court shall forward the matter to the 
22 Governor for review and may place the sheriff on administrative leave with pay.  If the 
23 court determines the matter requires more investigation, the court may refer the matter to 
24 the Attorney General with instructions to report back to the court or to forward the results 
25 of the investigation to the Governor.
26SUMMARY
27 This bill creates procedures for a majority of the county commissioners of a county to 
28 file a complaint with the Superior Court in the county to remove the sheriff for improper, 
29 unethical or criminal behavior.  After a hearing in which evidence may be presented by 
30 both sides, if the court finds cause, the court is required to forward the matter to the 
31 Governor for consideration of removal of the sheriff from office and may place the sheriff 
32 on administrative leave with pay.  If the court determines the matter requires more 
33 investigation, the court may refer the matter to the Attorney General with instructions to 
34 report back to the court or to forward the results of the investigation to the Governor.
