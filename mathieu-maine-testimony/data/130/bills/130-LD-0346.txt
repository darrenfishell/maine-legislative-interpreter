Page 1 - 130LR0594(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  25 MRSA ยง2469 is enacted to read:
3ยง2469.  Fuel gas detectors
41.  Fuel gas detector.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, 
5 "fuel gas detector" means a device:
6 A.  With an assembly that incorporates a sensor control component and an alarm 
7 notification that detects elevations in propane, natural gas or any liquified petroleum 
8 gas;
9 B.  That sounds a warning alarm; and
10 C.  That is approved or listed for the purpose specified in paragraph B by a nationally 
11 recognized independent testing laboratory.
12 A fuel gas detector may be battery-operated, plugged into an electrical outlet or hardwired.
132.  Fuel gas detector required.  The building owner shall install, or cause to be 
14 installed, in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements at least one approved fuel 
15 gas detector in every room containing an appliance fueled by propane, natural gas or any 
16 liquified petroleum gas in:
17 A.  Each unit in any building of multifamily occupancy;
18 B.  A fraternity house, sorority house or dormitory that is affiliated with an educational 
19 facility;
20 C.  A children's home, emergency children's shelter, children's residential care facility, 
21 shelter for homeless children or specialized children's home as defined in Title 22, 
22 section 8101, subsections 1, 2, 4, 4-A and 5, respectively; or 
23 D.  A hotel, motel or inn.
243.  Residential rental units.  In a residential rental unit occupied under the terms of a 
25 rental agreement or under a month-to-month tenancy:
26 A.  At the time of each occupancy, the landlord shall provide fuel gas detectors in 
27 accordance with subsection 2 if fuel gas detectors are not already present.  Each fuel 
28 gas detector must be in working condition.  After notification, in writing, by the tenant 
29 of any deficiencies in a fuel gas detector, the landlord shall repair or replace the fuel 
30 gas detector.  If the landlord did not know and had not been notified of the need to 
31 repair or replace a fuel gas detector, the landlord's failure to repair or replace the fuel 
32 gas detector may not be considered evidence of negligence in a subsequent civil action 
33 arising from death, property loss or personal injury; and
34 B.  The tenant shall keep the fuel gas detectors in working condition by keeping the 
35 fuel gas detectors connected to the electrical service in the building or keeping charged 
36 batteries in battery operated fuel gas detectors, by testing the fuel gas detectors 
37 periodically and by refraining from disabling the fuel gas detectors.
384.  Transfer of building.  A person who, after January 1, 2022, acquires by sale or 
39 exchange a building listed in subsection 2, paragraph A shall install fuel gas detectors in 
40 accordance with subsection 2 in the acquired building within 30 days of acquisition or 
41 occupancy of the building, whichever is later, if fuel gas detectors in accordance with 
Page 2 - 130LR0594(01)42 subsection 2 are not already present, and shall certify at the closing of the transaction that 
43 fuel gas detectors will be installed.  This certification must be signed and dated by the 
44 person acquiring the building.  A fuel gas detector must be installed in accordance with the 
45 manufacturer's requirements at the time of installation in each area containing an appliance 
46 fueled by propane, natural gas or liquified petroleum gas.  A person may not have a claim 
47 for relief against a property owner, a property purchaser, an authorized agent of a property 
48 owner or purchaser, a person in possession of real property, a closing agent or a lender for 
49 any damages resulting from the operation, maintenance or effectiveness of a fuel gas 
50 detector.  Violation of this subsection does not create a defect in title.
105.  Penalties.  A person who violates this section commits a civil violation for which a 
11 fine of not more than $500 for each violation may be adjudged.  The court may waive any 
12 penalty or cost against a violator upon satisfactory proof that the violation was corrected 
13 within 10 days of the issuance of a complaint.
146.  Liability.  Nothing in this section gives rise to any action against an owner required 
15 to comply with subsection 2 or 3 if the owner has conducted an inspection of the required 
16 fuel gas detectors immediately after installation and has reinspected the fuel gas detectors 
17 prior to occupancy by each new tenant, unless the owner has been given at least 24 hours' 
18 actual notice of a defect or failure of the fuel gas detector to operate properly and has failed 
19 to take action to correct the defect or failure.
207.  Noninterference.  A person may not knowingly interfere with or make inoperative 
21 any fuel gas detector required by this section, except that the owner or the agent of an owner 
22 of a building may temporarily disconnect a fuel gas detector in a dwelling unit or common 
23 area only for construction or rehabilitation activities when such activities are likely to 
24 activate the fuel gas detector or make it inactive.  The fuel gas detector must be immediately 
25 reconnected at the cessation of construction or rehabilitation activities each day, regardless 
26 of the intent to return to construction or rehabilitation activities on succeeding days.
27Sec. 2.  Effective date.  This Act takes effect January 1, 2022.
28SUMMARY
29 This bill requires the installation of fuel gas detectors to detect propane, natural gas and 
30 liquified petroleum gas.  The requirement applies to owners of: multifamily occupancy 
31 buildings; fraternity houses, sorority houses and dormitories that are affiliated with 
32 educational facilities; children's homes, emergency children's shelters, children's 
33 residential care facilities, shelters for homeless children and specialized children's homes; 
34 and hotels, motels and inns.  The bill is modeled on the laws applicable to those same 
35 buildings or facilities with regard to smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors.  The
