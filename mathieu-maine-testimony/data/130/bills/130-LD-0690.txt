Page 1 - 130LR0005(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §753, as amended by PL 1985, c. 804, §§1 and 22, is further 
3 amended to read:
4§753.  Two years
5 Actions for assault and battery, and for false imprisonment, slander and libel shall must 
6 be commenced within 2 years after the cause of action accrues.
7SUMMARY
8 The statute of limitations under current tort law for most civil suits is 6 years from 
9 when the cause of action accrues except that for assault and battery and false imprisonment 
10 it is 2 years, effectively depriving victims of domestic violence, among others, the same 
11 opportunity that most other victims of torts have to seek redress for their damages.  This 
12 bill removes the actions of assault and battery and false imprisonment from provisions 
13 setting a 2-year limitation period, making the actions subject to the general 6-year limitation 
14 period that applies to most other torts.8
