17SUMMARY
18 This bill makes the following changes to the provisions governing the Maine 
19 Commission on Indigent Legal Services.
20 1.  It changes the salary range of the executive director of the commission from 52 to 
21 37, resulting in a higher top salary.
22 2.  It authorizes the commission to directly employ attorneys to provide legal services 
23 to indigent clients.  It also requires the commission to establish an audit system and allow 
24 the recoupment of payments when appropriate.  The commission is given subpoena power, 
25 enforceable in the Superior Court, to conduct the audits.  It directs the executive director to 
26 carry out the audits and seek recoupment.  It authorizes the executive director to exercise 
27 the subpoena power on behalf of the commission.
28 3.  Current law provides that rules governing standards and training for attorneys are 
29 major substantive rules.  This bill changes those rules to be routine technical and also 
30 corrects a cross-reference in the commission's rule-making authority.
31 4.  It provides that any remaining balance in the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal 
32 Services program, General Fund in fiscal year 2020-21 be carried into 2021-22 and fiscal 
33 year 2021-22 be carried into 2022-23.
34 5.  It provides funding to the commission to fully staff the commission; to increase the 
35 salary of the executive director; to increase the hourly rate from $60 per hour to $80 per 
36 hour for attorneys providing legal services; to establish an appellate public defender, which 
37 includes one attorney and one paralegal in fiscal year 2021-22 and 2 additional attorneys 
38 in fiscal year 2022-23; and provides further funding.1
