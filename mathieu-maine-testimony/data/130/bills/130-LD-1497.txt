5 section 12004-J, subsection 19 and referred to in this section as "the commission," is made 
6 up entirely by young people to provide the representation of youth voices in all aspects of 
7 state policy making to ensure that young people throughout the State have a prosperous, 
8 sustainable and secure future in the State.  The commission shall promote, coordinate and 
9 implement programs designed to improve opportunities for young people in the State.  The 
10 mission of the commission is to make sure that critical data is collected and used to directly 
11 inform policy makers about the issues affecting young people in the State and to ensure 
12 that youth advocates and organizations have a direct and coordinated access point to policy 
13 makers and government.  For purposes of this section, "young people" means persons 15 
14 years of age or older and under 31 years of age.
152.  Membership.  The commission consists of 15 members appointed as follows:
16 A.  One member of the Senate, appointed by the President of the Senate;

23 Members of the commission must be residents of the State and members of the public must 
24 be young people chosen to be geographically, politically, racially and economically 
25 diverse.  Preference must be given to members of the public who have knowledge of 
26 problems facing young people of various racial and ethnic backgrounds in the State and 
27 who have experience in advocacy relating to the issues experienced by young people in the 
28 State.  All members of the commission may provide policy suggestions, guidance and 
29 supervision for issues and programs that improve opportunities for young people.
303.  Terms; quorum; meetings; termination.  Members serve for a term of 2 years.  
31 The members shall select a chair from among the members of the commission.  At the end 
32 of a term an outgoing member serves until a successor has been appointed.  A member may

40 cause, the reason for which must be communicated to the member whose membership was
