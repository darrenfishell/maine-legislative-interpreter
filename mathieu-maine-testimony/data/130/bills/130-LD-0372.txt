30 available to the State for the State Children's Health Insurance Program through the federal 
31 Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Public Law 105-33, 111 Stat. 251, referred to in this section

34 to children under 19 years of age whose family income is above the eligibility level for 
35 Medicaid under section 3174-G and below the maximum eligibility level established under

42 required under this paragraph, the commissioner shall adjust the maximum eligibility 
43 level in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
Page 2 - 130LR0876(01)1 (1)  The adjustment must accomplish the purposes of the Cub Care program set 
2 forth in subsection 1.
3  ( 2)  If Cub Care program expenditures are reasonably anticipated to exceed the 
4 program budget, the commissioner shall lower the maximum eligibility level set in 
5 paragraph A to the extent necessary to bring the program within the program 
6 budget.
7 (3)  If Cub Care program expenditures are reasonably anticipated to fall below the 
8 program budget, the commissioner shall raise the maximum eligibility level set in 
9 paragraph A to the extent necessary to provide coverage to as many children as 
10 possible within the fiscal constraints of the program budget.  If Cub Care program 
11 expenditures are reasonably anticipated to exceed the program budget after raising 
12 the maximum eligibility level pursuant to this subparagraph, the commissioner 
13 may lower the maximum eligibility level to the level established in paragraph A.
14 (4)  The commissioner shall give at least 30 days' notice of the proposed change in 
15 maximum eligibility level to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
16 jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs and the joint standing 
17 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services 
18 matters.

28 health plan for which the employer paid 50% or more of the cost for the child's

30 ( a)  The cost to the employee of coverage for the family exceeds 10% of the 
31 family's income;

36 apply to a person under 21 years of age who is not a citizen of the United States.
373.  Program administration; benefit design.  With the exception of premium 
38 payments under subsection 5 and any other requirements imposed under this section, the

40 in one administrative structure within the department, with the same enrollment and

44 promote a simplified eligibility form and eligibility process.
Page 4 - 130LR0876(01)14.  Benefit delivery.  The Cub Care program must use, but is not limited to, the same

20 B.  When a premium is not paid at the beginning of a month, the department shall give 
21 notice of nonpayment at that time and again at the beginning of the 6th month of the 6-
22 month enrollment period if the premium is still unpaid, and the department shall 
23 provide an opportunity for a hearing and a grace period in which the premium may be 
24 paid and no penalty will apply for the late payment.  If a premium is not paid by the

36 of months of coverage under the Cub Care program without premium payment, not to 
37 exceed 3 months.
38 D.  The department shall adopt rules allowing waiver of premiums for good cause.
396.  Incentives.  In the contracting process for the Cub Care program and the Medicaid 
40 program, the department shall create incentives to reward health plans that contract with 
41 school-based clinics, community health centers and other community-based programs.
Page 5 - 130LR0876(01)17.  Administrative costs.  The department shall budget 2% of the costs of the Cub Care 
2 program for outreach activities.  After the first 6 months of the program and to the extent
