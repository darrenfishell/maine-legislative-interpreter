Page 1 - 130LR0284(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §4311, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. SSSS, §1, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Departmental reimbursement.  When a municipality incurs net general assistance 
5 costs in any fiscal year prior to July 1, 2015 in excess of .0003 of that municipality's most 
6 recent state valuation relative to the state fiscal year for which reimbursement is being 
7 issued, as determined by the State Tax Assessor in the statement filed as provided in Title 
8 36, section 381, the Department of Health and Human Services shall reimburse the 
9 municipality for 90% of the amount in excess of these expenditures when the department 
10 finds that the municipality has been in compliance with all requirements of this chapter.  If 
11 a municipality elects to determine need without consideration of funds distributed from any 
12 municipally-controlled trust fund that must otherwise be considered for purposes of this 
13 chapter, the department shall reimburse the municipality for 66 2/3% of the amount in 
14 excess of such expenditures when the department finds that the municipality has otherwise 
15 been in compliance with all requirements of this chapter.
16 The department shall reimburse each municipality and each Indian tribe 70% of the direct 
17 costs incurred by that municipality or tribe on or after July 1, 2015 and prior to July 1, 2022 
18 for the general assistance program granted by that municipality or tribe.  For the purposes 
19 of this subsection, "Indian tribe" has the same meaning as in section 411, subsection 8-A.
20Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §4311, sub-§1-D is enacted to read:
211-D.  Departmental reimbursement beginning 2022.  Beginning July 1, 2022, the 
22 department shall reimburse each municipality for the direct costs incurred by that 
23 municipality for the general assistance program granted by that municipality if the 
24 department finds that the municipality was in compliance with all requirements of this 
25 chapter during the fiscal year for which reimbursement is sought.  The department shall 
26 reimburse to each municipality an amount equal to 70% of all direct general assistance 
27 granted by the municipality equal to or below .0003 and 90% of all direct general assistance 
28 granted by the municipality in excess of .0003 of that municipality's most recent state 
29 valuation relative to the state fiscal year for which reimbursement is being issued, as 
30 determined by the State Tax Assessor in the statement filed as provided in Title 36, section 
31 381.
32Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §4311, sub-§1-E is enacted to read:
331-E.  Indian tribe reimbursement beginning 2022.  Beginning July 1, 2022, the 
34 department shall reimburse each Indian tribe for 100% of all direct costs for general 
35 assistance granted by the Indian tribe if the department finds that the Indian tribe was in 
36 compliance with all requirements of this chapter during the fiscal year for which 
37 reimbursement is sought.  For the purposes of this subsection, "Indian tribe" has the same 
38 meaning as in section 411, subsection 8-A.
39SUMMARY
40 This bill requires the State to provide 100% reimbursement for general assistance costs 
41 to Indian tribes.  It provides that a municipality's most recent state valuation rather than the 
42 all state valuation is used for calculating when the municipality begins to be reimbursed 
43 90% for general assistance costs and that the reimbursement is for gross costs rather than 
Page 2 - 130LR0284(01)44 net costs.  It establishes that the new departmental reimbursement to municipalities begins 
45 July 1, 2022.1
