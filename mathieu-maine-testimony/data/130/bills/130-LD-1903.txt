37SUMMARY
38 This bill does the following.
39 1.  In Part A, in response to State v. Weddle, 2020 ME 12, the bill repeals the Maine 
40 Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 2522, which was found to be unconstitutional in that 38
Page 7 - 130LR2555(01)41 it required the driver's blood to be taken without consent and without probable cause to 
42 believe that the driver was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time the driver's blood was 
43 taken.  The bill also moves the statutory allocation of the one-year period of suspension for 
44 refusal to take a chemical test when there is probable cause to believe that death occurred 
45 or will occur as a result of an accident to the law on implied consent to a chemical test and 
46 makes the language consistent with existing law.
7 2.  In Part B, the bill amends Title 15, section 393 to recognize that convictions in the 
8 tribal courts of federally recognized Indian tribes are disqualifying convictions for the 
9 purposes of the prohibition against firearms created by Title 15, section 393.  It makes Title 
10 15, section 393 more consistent with the Maine Criminal Code by using the phrase "another 
11 jurisdiction" to reference the courts identified by that term.
12 3.  In Part C, in response to State v. LeBlanc-Simpson, 2018 ME 109, the bill clarifies 
13 that a judicial officer in issuing a written release order under Title 15, section 1026, 
14 subsection 2-A or 3 must inform a defendant of the conditions of release, that the conditions 
15 take effect and are fully enforceable immediately and that failure to appear or comply with 
16 conditions may result in revocation of bail and additional criminal penalties.  The bill 
17 provides that a condition of release takes effect and is fully enforceable immediately as of 
18 the time the judicial officer sets the condition, unless the release order expressly excludes 
19 a condition of release from immediate applicability, if the defendant is advised of the 
20 conditions and that failure to appear or comply with the conditions may subject the 
21 defendant to revocation of bail and additional criminal penalties.  This bill provides that 
22 the notice required in order for a condition of release to take effect immediately may be 
23 provided by a judicial officer, a law enforcement officer or an employee of a county or 
24 regional jail or a correctional facility having custody of the defendant.
25 4.  In Part D, the bill amends the laws governing probation to reflect the current practice 
26 of the Department of Corrections with respect to calculating the period of probation.  A 
27 probationer receives credit for a full day of probation on the day probation commences, 
28 regardless of the time of day, and receives no credit for a day on which probation is tolled.  
29 The period of probation ends when the final day of the probation period ends.
30 5.  In Part E, the bill amends the law to respond to the issue identified by the Law Court 
31 in State v. Asaad, 2020 ME 11, specifically the absence of a mens rea requirement in the 
32 Class C crime of gross sexual assault under Title 17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph 
33 M.  The bill requires the State to prove, as an element of that crime of gross sexual assault, 
34 that the defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct knowing that the other person had not 
35 expressly or impliedly acquiesced.  Because the same issue exists in the crimes of unlawful 
36 sexual contact and unlawful sexual touching, the same "knowing" culpable mental state 
37 element is proposed for the corresponding Class C and Class D crimes of unlawful sexual 
38 contact and the corresponding Class D crime of unlawful sexual touching.  This current 
39 proposal reflects the original proposal of the Criminal Law Advisory Commission in L.D. 
40 710 and differs from the committee amendment to that bill.  The committee amendment to 
41 L.D. 710 proposed a culpable mental state element of recklessness with respect to the 
42 attendant circumstances element of the other person's acquiescence.1
