Page 1 - 130LR0106(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  16 MRSA ยง807, as amended by PL 2013, c. 507, ยง8, is repealed.
3Sec. 2.  16 MRSA ยง807-A is enacted to read:
4ยง807-A.  Confirming existence or nonexistence of intelligence and investigative record 
5information
61.  Refusal to confirm existence or nonexistence.  A Maine criminal justice agency 
7 may refuse to confirm the existence or nonexistence of a record that is or contains 
8 intelligence and investigative record information, whether or not the information exists or 
9 does not exist, only if there is a reasonable possibility that the fact of the record's existence 
10 or nonexistence would:
11 A.  Interfere with law enforcement proceedings related to crimes;
12 B.  Endanger the life or physical safety of an individual, including, but not limited to, 
13 a victim of domestic violence, a victim of abuse, a confidential source or law 
14 enforcement personnel;
15 C.  Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of one or more individuals; 
16 or
17 D.  Disclose specific investigatory techniques that are not known to the general public 
18 and that, if disclosed, would cause the use of those techniques to be compromised. For 
19 the purposes of this paragraph, "specific investigatory techniques" does not include 
20 types of technology that might be used for investigative purposes.
212.  Appeal.  A person aggrieved by the decision of a Maine criminal justice agency 
22 under subsection 1 to refuse to confirm the existence or nonexistence of a record that is or 
23 contains intelligence and investigative record information may, within 30 calendar days of 
24 the receipt of written notice from the agency, appeal that decision to the Superior Court for 
25 the county where the person resides or where the agency has its principal office. With 
26 respect to an appeal under this subsection:
27 A.  Within 14 calendar days of service of the appeal, an official of the Maine criminal 
28 justice agency shall file with the court a statement of position explaining the basis for 
29 the agency's decision;
30 B.  Within 14 calendar days of service of the appeal, an official of the Maine criminal 
31 justice agency may file with the court, in addition to the statement under paragraph A, 
32 an ex parte statement of position providing an explanation of the basis for the agency's 
33 decision if an ex parte explanation is necessary to avoid revealing the information 
34 withheld under subsection 1;
35 C.  The court may take testimony and other evidence it determines to be necessary in 
36 the appeal;
37 D.  If the court after review of the appeal and any filings and testimony in the appeal 
38 and an in camera review of any ex parte statement filed by the Maine criminal justice 
39 agency under paragraph B determines that the agency's decision was not in accordance 
40 with subsection 1, the court shall enter an order requiring the agency to confirm the 
41 existence or nonexistence of the record that is or contains intelligence and investigative 
Page 2 - 130LR0106(01)42 record information under subsection 1 and to further respond to the appellant's request 
43 as appropriate and permitted by law; and
3 E.  The appeal may be advanced on the court docket and receive priority over other 
4 cases if the court determines that the interests of justice so require.
5SUMMARY
6 This bill amends the Intelligence and Investigative Record Information Act to allow 
7 Maine criminal justice agencies to refuse to confirm the existence or nonexistence of a 
8 record that is or contains intelligence and investigative record information, but only in the 
9 circumstances specified in the bill. Current law broadly prohibits Maine criminal justice 
10 agencies from confirming the existence or nonexistence of such information to any person 
11 or public or private entity that is not eligible to receive the information.
12 The bill also enacts an appeal process for a person aggrieved by a decision of an agency 
13 to refuse to confirm the existence or nonexistence of a record that is or contains intelligence 
14 and investigative record information.1
