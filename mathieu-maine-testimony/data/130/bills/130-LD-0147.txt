12 modification for the carry-over of this amount in future years.

27 conformity to the CARES Act net operating loss limitation suspension in Part A apply

32 modification is for the total amount of the foreign-derived intangible income and global 
33 intangible low-taxed income deduction claimed in accordance with the Internal Revenue 
34 Code, Section 250(a).
