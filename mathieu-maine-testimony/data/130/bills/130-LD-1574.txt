Page 1 - 130LR1677(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services does not currently propose 
4 or require specialized reimbursement rates, also known as behavior add-ons, to providers 
5 of positive behavioral support and behavior management services to persons with 
6 intellectual disabilities or autism experiencing a personal crisis that could lead to the loss 
7 of their home, program or employment; and
8Whereas, providers of positive behavioral support and behavior management services 
9 to persons with intellectual disabilities or autism are unable to manage situations that 
10 involve specialized training because the reimbursement rates are insufficient to provide the 
11 services; and
12Whereas, unresolved crisis situations for persons with intellectual disabilities or 
13 autism currently result in more traumatic and expensive outcomes and will continue if 
14 specialized reimbursement rates are not immediately established and funded; and
15Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
16 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
17 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
