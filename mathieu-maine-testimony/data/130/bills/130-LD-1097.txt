Page 2 - 130LR1652(01)1SUMMARY
2 The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the site location of development law subjects 
3 to review those projects that are truly of state or regional significance.  It requires the 
4 application of the law to residential subdivisions only if they contain at least 100 dwelling 
5 units.  It increases the threshold for review by modifying the definition of "structure" to 
6 include at least 5 nonvegetated acres, increased from 3 acres.  It exempts solar energy 
7 projects generating less than 10 megawatts from review, even if the project covers more 
8 than 20 acres.2
