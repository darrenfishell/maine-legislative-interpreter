3Sec. 7.  21-A MRSA §1019-B, sub-§6 is enacted to read:

7 construed to preclude a candidate from seeking monetary or equitable relief from the person 
8 who made the independent expenditure through a civil action, including but not limited to

10SUMMARY
11 This bill amends the campaign finance laws to prohibit a person from, with actual 
12 malice, making an independent expenditure to design, produce or disseminate a 
13 communication that contains a false statement regarding any candidate.  The bill also 
14 requires a person who makes an independent expenditure to include in a report filed with 
15 the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices a written statement under 
16 oath or affirmation that the communication financed by the independent expenditure does 
17 not contain such a false statement.  A person is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 
18 for making an independent expenditure in violation of the prohibition or for falsely signing 
19 the written statement included in the report to the commission.  The bill does not preclude 
20 a candidate from seeking monetary or equitable relief through a civil action, including an 
21 action for slander or libel, against the person who made the independent expenditure.
22 The bill also makes the following changes to the laws governing independent 
23 expenditures:
24 1.  It adds clarity by including within the definition of independent expenditure, rather 
25 than in an exception to that definition, that an independent expenditure is an expenditure 
26 that is not made in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion 
27 of, a candidate, a candidate's political committee or an agent of either; and
28 2.  Because the word "person" is defined to include a party committee and a political 
29 action committee for purposes of the campaign finance laws, it removes redundant 
30 references to these entities in the statute governing independent expenditures.11
