10§7506.  Maine Service Fellows Program
11 The Maine Service Fellows Program, referred to in this section as "the program," is 
12 established within the commission.  Individuals who participate in the program are referred 
13 to in this section as "program fellows."  The commission shall administer the program in 
14 accordance with this section.
151.  Program purposes.  The commission shall establish the program to:
16 A.  Increase the opportunities for citizens to devote a year of service to communities in 
17 the State;
18 B.  Attract to and retain in the State motivated adults who have completed a college 
19 degree within the prior 5 years to serve in positions where they can apply skills and 
20 abilities to projects for the benefit of citizens of the State;
21 C.  Provide rural and underserved communities in the State a resource to address critical 
22 health and human, public safety, education and environmental needs; and
23 D.  Strengthen civic engagement of both the program fellows and community residents 
24 through solutions based in whole or in part in volunteer service.
252.  Program design.  The program must be designed to coordinate with appropriate 
26 organizations in the served communities.  Program fellows must be required to commit up 
27 to 20% of their time in the program to developing regional networks of volunteer programs 
28 whose common goals can result in mutual benefits.  An entity may submit a proposal to 
29 sponsor a program fellow based on guidelines established under this subsection.  Services 
30 provided by a program fellow may include but are not limited to services to address home 
31 evictions, to support workforce development, to mitigate and prevent substance use 
32 disorder and to promote mental health. The commission may identify other priority needs 
33 of communities to be addressed by the program and may make those services available to 
34 eligible communities.   During the first 3 years of operation of the program, the commission 
35 shall ensure that program fellows focus on helping communities recover from the effects 
36 of coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, and the related pandemic, while 
37 also addressing long-term issues that communities face.  The commission shall establish 
38 guidelines for the program that include but are not limited to:
39 A.  Limiting the eligibility of entities that may sponsor program fellows to local or 
40 county government, school districts, nonprofit organizations, faith-based organizations 
41 and similar entities;
Page 2 - 130LR0402(01)1 B.  Establishing standards for local sponsors regarding supervision and support of 
2 program fellows during their service;
3 C.  Ensuring that projects and project proposals are well-designed and measure their 
4 impact and do not include partisan or political activity;
5 D.  Ensuring that program fellows are not used to replace positions eliminated or 
6 position hours reduced as a result of budget cuts by the sponsor;
7 E.  Requiring criminal background checks or other safeguards if projects involve 
8 working with vulnerable populations such as school children;
9 F.  Authorizing private sector and local partner contributions to program operations for 
10 travel reimbursements or training costs; and
11 G.  Any other guideline that the commission believes will benefit the program.
123.  Compensation.  To the extent funds are available, the commission shall ensure that 
13 program fellows receive the following compensation for service:
14 A.  A stipend set by the commission to achieve an annual income of up to 212% of the 
15 nonfarm income official federal poverty level.  To the extent the stipend is paid from 
16 the General Fund or any other account of the commission, personal liability insurance 
17 and workers' compensation insurance, paid for from the same source of funds, must 
18 also be provided.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, program fellows are not 
19 employees of the State for the purposes of Title 5, Part 20;
20 B.  A program completion bonus that includes:
21 (1)  Eligibility for the applicable in-state tuition rate for a program of study within 
22 the University of Maine System, if the program fellow, within one year of 
23 completion of service in the program, enrolls in such a program and is not 
24 otherwise eligible for in-state tuition; and
25 (2)  To the extent established by the commission by rule, an educational loan 
26 payment in an amount up to 20% of the stipend value paid on behalf of the program 
27 fellow to the holder of the loan; and
28 C.  An allowance to pay for individual health insurance not to exceed 2% of the stipend 
29 amount.
304. Funding.  The commission may seek and receive both private and federal funds, 
31 grants and gifts in support of the program.  The commission may accept funding from other 
32 state agencies to support program fellows whose work will support and promote goals of 
33 programs administered by those agencies.
345. Rules. The commission may adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
35 section.  Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 
36 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
37Sec. 4.  Program launch.  Within 180 days following the effective date of this Act, 
38 to the extent of any available funds, the Maine Commission for Community Service shall 
39 seek to establish in 2022 the first class of program fellows in the Maine Service Fellows 
40 Program under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 7506, consisting of 10 program 
41 fellows who agree to participate in the program for up to 1,800 hours over a 12-month 
42 period beginning in 2022.
Page 3 - 130LR0402(01)1Sec. 5.  Report.  The commission shall report to the joint standing committee of the 
2 Legislature having jurisdiction over state and local government matters regarding the 
3 operations of the Maine Service Fellows Program established in the Maine Revised
