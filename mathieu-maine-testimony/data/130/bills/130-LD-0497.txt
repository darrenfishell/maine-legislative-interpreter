2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 has 
4 created a public health emergency; and
5Whereas, as a result of COVID-19, many children are not attending school in person, 
6 are missing doctor's appointments and are otherwise not interacting with persons required 
7 by law to report suspected abuse or neglect; and
8Whereas, lack of regular contact with people outside of the family home places many 
9 children at risk of child abuse and neglect; and
10Whereas, those children are in immediate need of intervention in order to prevent 
11 abuse and neglect from occurring; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
