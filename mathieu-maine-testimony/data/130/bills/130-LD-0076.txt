Page 1 - 130LR0183(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the sole purpose of the Board of Dental Practice is to protect the public 
4 health and welfare by ensuring that the public is served by competent and honest 
5 practitioners and by establishing minimum standards of proficiency; and
6Whereas, pursuant to Public Law 2019, chapter 388, section 11, the Board of Dental 
7 Practice issued a legislative report dated January 31, 2020, making recommendations to 
8 further revise the Dental Practice Act by revising existing supervision and scopes of 
9 practice provisions, to consider technological advances such as the use of teledentistry to 
10 provide greater flexibility in the delivery of dental services and to improve access to dental 
11 care in Maine; and
12Whereas, LD 2146, An Act To Implement the Recommendations of the Board of 
13 Dental Practice Related to the Definitions of "Supervision" and "Teledentistry," was

15 due to the existing state of civil emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and
16Whereas, substantive policy decisions such as authorizing the use of teledentistry and 
17 refining scopes of practice, including levels of supervision, are appropriate for the 
18 legislative process, not an administrative rule-making process; and

20 professionals to fully exercise their scopes of practice and use available technologies to 
21 provide care; and
