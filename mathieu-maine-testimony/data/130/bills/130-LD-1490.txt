3SUMMARY
4 This bill amends the system of care for adults with intellectual disabilities, autism, 
5 brain injury and other related conditions in the following ways.
6 1.  It renames "system of care" the "system of services and support."
7 2.  It amends the principles guiding delivery of services by providers of services and 
8 the Department of Health and Human Services to add the principle that inadequate 
9 reimbursement rates, extended stays on waiting lists and service definitions that do not 
10 meet the needs of persons who have significant need for significant levels of support are 
11 incompatible with the other goals guiding delivery of services.
12 3.  It requires the department to post at least monthly on the department's website, for 
13 each home and community-based services waiver in which the State participates, data on 
14 how many persons were on a waiting list for services on the first day of that month, 
15 including, for prioritized waiting lists, how many persons were in each prioritization 
16 category.
17 4.  It requires the department to post at least quarterly on the department's website, for 
18 each home and community-based services waiver in which the State participates, data on 
19 median time from application for waiver services to approval by the department for receipt 
20 of the same waiver services, using a statistically valid methodology.
21 5.  It requires that the Commissioner of Health and Human Services' plan include 
22 quality metrics and data collection developed with input from across stakeholder groups.
23 6.  It requires that the commissioner's plan include participation of persons with 
24 intellectual disabilities, autism, brain injury and other related conditions; direct care 
25 workers; and persons from immigrant and indigenous populations.  It requires the plan to 
26 describe how the commissioner achieved the required inclusion and to describe the 
27 feedback received from participants in each required group.
28 7.  It requires that the commissioner's plan project whether there will be any waiting 
29 lists for home and community-based services waivers over the next 4 years, how many 
30 people are projected to be on those waiting lists, how many people are projected to be in 
31 each prioritization category of prioritized waiting lists and how many people would be in 
32 a different prioritization category if they were not currently living with a parent.
33 8.  It requires that the commissioner's plan project the budgetary impact of eliminating 
34 any waiting lists for home and community-based services if such waiting lists are projected 
35 to exist over the next 4 years, including detailing any anticipated savings from release of 
36 resources of a less expensive service when a person transfers to another service.
37 9.  It allows the commissioner's plan to consider how home and community-based 
38 services may be redesigned to promote self-determination by persons with intellectual 
39 disabilities or autism, to promote less restrictive placements over more restrictive 
40 placements and to promote competitive integrated employment by persons with intellectual 
41 disabilities or autism.1

8 home and community-based services to add a so-called "behavioral add-on" for persons
