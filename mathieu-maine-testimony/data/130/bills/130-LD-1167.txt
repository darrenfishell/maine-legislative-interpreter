2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §600-A is enacted to read:
3§600-A.  Criminal history record information; employment application
41.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Criminal history record information" has the same meaning as in Title 16, section 
7 703, subsection 3.
8 B.  "Employer" means a person in this State who employs individuals.  "Employer" 
9 includes municipalities and political subdivisions of the State, but does not include an 
10 employer of an individual who holds a position in the legislative, executive or judicial 
11 branch of State Government or a position with a quasi-independent state entity or 
12 public instrumentality of the State.  "Employer" includes a person acting in the interest 
13 of an employer directly or indirectly.
142.  Initial employee application form.  Except as provided in subsection 3, an 
15 employer may not:
16 A.  Request criminal history record information on the employer's initial employee 
17 application form; or
18 B.  State on an initial employee application form or advertisement or specify prior to 
19 determining a person is otherwise qualified for the position that a person with a 
20 criminal history may not apply or will not be considered for a position.
21 An employer may inquire about a prospective employee's criminal history record 
22 information during an interview or once the prospective employee has been determined 
23 otherwise qualified for the position.
243.  Exceptions for initial employee application form.  An employer may inquire 
25 about criminal convictions on an initial employee application form or state on an initial 
26 employee application form or advertisement or otherwise assert that a person with a 
27 criminal history may not apply or will not be considered for a position if:
28 A.  The position is one for which a federal or state law or regulation or rule creates a 
29 mandatory or presumptive disqualification based on a conviction for one or more types 
30 of criminal offenses, and the questions on the initial employee application form are 
31 limited to the types of criminal offenses creating the disqualification;
32 B.  The employer is subject to an obligation imposed by a federal or state law or 
33 regulation or rule not to employ in a position a person who has been convicted of one 
34 or more types of criminal offenses, and the questions on the initial employee 
35 application form are limited to the types of criminal offenses creating the obligation; 
36 or
37 C.  The employer is required by federal or state law or regulation or rule to conduct a 
38 criminal history record check for the position for which the prospective employee is 
39 applying.
404.  Penalty.  This section must be enforced pursuant to section 626-A.
41Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §626-A, first ¶, as amended by PL 2019, c. 35, §2, is further 
42 amended to read:
Page 2 - 130LR1613(01)1 Whoever violates any of the provisions of section 600-A, sections 621-A to 623 or 
2 section 626, 628, 628‑A, 629 or 629-B is subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100 nor 
3 more than $500 for each violation.
4SUMMARY
5 This bill prohibits an employer from requesting criminal history record information on 
6 an initial employee application form or stating on an initial employee application form or 
7 advertisement or specifying prior to determining a person is otherwise qualified for the 
8 position that a person with a criminal history may not apply or will not be considered for a 
9 position.
10 The bill provides exceptions to those prohibitions, including instances in which federal 
11 or state law or regulation or rule mandates for a position that a criminal conviction 
12 disqualifies an applicant, or imposes an obligation on an employer not to hire an applicant 
13 who has been convicted of a certain type of offense, or requires that an employer conduct 
14 a criminal history record check.
15 An employer who violates this prohibition is subject to a penalty of not less than $100 
16 nor more than $500 for each violation, to be enforced by the Department of Labor.
