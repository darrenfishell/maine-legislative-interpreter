24SUMMARY
25 This bill makes the following changes to campaign finance and related laws:
26 1.  It employs the phrase "separate segregated fund committee" to describe a political 
27 action committee that is a separate or segregated fund established by any corporation, 
28 membership organization, cooperative or labor or other organization and whose purpose is 
29 to initiate or influence a campaign.
30 2.  It limits the contributions that a leadership political action committee, defined as a 
31 political action committee other than a caucus political action committee for which a 
32 Legislator serves as a principal officer or treasurer, may make and receive. A leadership 
33 political action committee may make contributions to candidates that do not exceed the 
34 contribution limitations applicable to individuals.  A leadership political action committee 
35 may accept contributions from individuals, other leadership political action committees, 
36 labor organizations and separate segregated fund committees as long as those contributions 
37 do not exceed the amount that the contributor may contribute to a legislative candidate 
38 under current law. 
39 3.  It prohibits a business entity, defined as a firm, partnership, corporation, 
40 incorporated association or other organization other than a labor organization, whether 
41 organized as a for-profit or a nonprofit entity, from making contributions to a candidate or 
42 leadership political action committee.  It also prohibits a political committee, political 1
