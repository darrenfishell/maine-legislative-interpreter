Page 1 - 130LR0153(01)1Preamble.  Two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature deeming it necessary in 
2 accordance with the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 14 to authorize the issuance 
3 of bonds on behalf of the State of Maine to provide funds as described in this Act,
4Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
5PART A
6Sec. A-1.  Authorization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized, under the 
7 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
8 amount not exceeding $80,000,000 for the purposes described in section 6 of this Part.  The 
9 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for a 
10 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
11Sec. A-2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State 
12 shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the name 
13 of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of sale 
14 and the date when payable.
15Sec. A-3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of 
16 State may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may 
17 be loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
18 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
19 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
20 forth in this Part.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
21 in this Part lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
22 general obligation bonds.
23Sec. A-4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay interest 
24 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Part and all sums coming due for payment 
25 of bonds at maturity.
26Sec. A-5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds.   The proceeds of the bonds must be 
27 expended as set out in this Part under the direction and supervision of the Department of 
28 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
29 1.  The proceeds of the bonds for the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in section 
30 6 must be expended by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry for 
31 acquisition of land and interest in land for conservation, water access, outdoor recreation, 
32 wildlife and fish habitat, working farmland preservation in accordance with the provisions 
33 for such acquisitions under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 and working 
34 waterfront protection in accordance with the terms of Public Law 2005, chapter 462, Part 
35 B, section 6, including all costs associated with such acquisitions, except that use of the 
36 proceeds of these bonds is subject to the following conditions and requirements.
37 A.  Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on land acquired 
38 with bond proceeds, except to the extent of applicable state, local or federal laws, rules 
39 and regulations and except for working waterfront projects and working farmland 
40 preservation projects.
41 B.  Payment from bond proceeds for acquisitions of land or interest in land for 
42 community conservation projects as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
43 section 6201, subsection 1-B may be made directly to cooperating entities as defined 
Page 2 - 130LR0153(01)44 in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2 for acquisition of land and interest in land by 
45 cooperating entities, subject to terms and conditions enforceable by the State to ensure 
46 its use for the purposes of this Part.
4 C.  The bond funds expended for conservation, recreation, working waterfronts, 
5 working farmland, community conservation projects and water access must be matched 
6 with at least $60,000,000 in public and private contributions. Seventy percent of that 
7 amount must be in the form of cash or other tangible assets, including the value of land 
8 and real property interest acquired by or contributed to cooperating entities, as defined 
9 in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2, when property interests have a direct relationship 
10 to the property proposed for protection, as determined by the Land for Maine's Future 
11 Board. The remaining 30% may be matching contributions and may include the value 
12 of project-related, in-kind contributions of goods and services to and by cooperating 
13 entities.
14 D.  Because of changing climate conditions, projects that address climate change, 
15 resiliency and mitigation strategies that benefit natural ecosystems, wildlife and 
16 working waterfronts and farmland to adapt must be given special consideration by the 
17 Land for Maine's Future Board.
18 E.  To the extent the purposes are consistent with the disbursement provisions in this 
19 Part, 100% of the bond proceeds may be considered as state match for any federal 
20 funding to be made available to the State.
21 2.  Because portions of the State have deer populations that are struggling and deer 
22 wintering habitat protection is vital to the survival and enhancement of these populations, 
23 projects that conserve and protect deer wintering areas are considered to have special value 
24 and must receive preferential consideration during scoring of new applications for support 
25 under Title 5, chapter 353.  The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and 
26 the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall take a proactive approach to pursuing 
27 land conservation projects that include conservation of priority deer wintering areas and 
28 not working waterfront preservation projects or working farmland preservation projects.  
29 In order to be subject to this designation, priority deer wintering areas must be of at least 
30 500 acres or contiguous with existing conservation land so that the combined acreage 
31 constitutes at least 500 acres, must have been historically used by deer at some point since 
32 1950 and must be capable of providing shelter for deer on the effective date of this Part or 
33 within 20 years of the effective date of this Part.  The Department of Inland Fisheries and 
34 Wildlife shall include in conservation negotiations under this section provisions for the 
35 appropriate management of priority deer wintering areas.  Land and interest in land 
36 purchased by the State that contains priority deer wintering areas must be managed using 
37 protocol provided by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
38 3.  Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
39 section 6, at least 5% must be made available to acquire public access to water in 
40 accordance with Title 5, section 6203-A. Funds under this subsection not spent within a 
41 10-year period may be allocated at the discretion of the Land for Maine's Future Board.
42 4.  Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
43 section 6, at least 10% must be made available to protect farmland in accordance with Title 
44 5, section 6207. Funds under this subsection not spent within a 10-year period may be 
45 allocated at the discretion of the Land for Maine's Future Board.1

2 section 6, at least 10% must be made available to protect working waterfront properties in 
3 accordance with Public Law 2005, chapter 462, Part B, section 6. Funds under this 
4 subsection not spent within a 10-year period may be allocated at the discretion of the Land
