of the State at low or no cost through hospitals, pharmacies and health care providers in the 
State or at a reduced cost on a means-tested basis. In its assessment, the commission shall 
consider various factors including:

appropriate institution or through a public-private partnership with a licensed drug 
manufacturer to produce insulin and insulin analogs in an amount sufficient to fulfill the 
needs of low-income residents of the State who require insulin; 
3. Any long-term cost savings and revenue generation for the State and the University 
of Maine System; 
4. Any long-term cost savings and other benefits to low-income residents of the State 
who would receive insulin and insulin analogs at low or no cost; 
5. Any costs to the University of Maine System and to the State to produce and 
distribute insulin and insulin analogs, including additional administrative costs; 
6. State and federal regulatory or legal obstacles, including requirements for licensure, 
to the production and distribution of insulin and insulin analogs within the State by the 
University of Maine System or other appropriate institutions; 
7. Available alternative methods for providing insulin and insulin analogs to lowÂ­
income residents of the State at low or no cost; 
8. Options for capping copayments for insulin and insulin analogs provided through 
private insurers; 
9. The potential for the State to engage in volume purchasing of insulin and insulin 
analogs at reduced cost; 
10. The mechanisms by which the State could establish a program to distribute insulin 
and insulin analogs to residents of the State; 
11. Opportunities to establish an interstate compact with other New England states to 
reduce insulin and insulin analog costs in compact states; 
12. Opportunities to establish a public entity to manage the purchasing and distribution 
of insulin and insulin analogs with the possibility of eventual transition to a private entity; 
13. Opportunities to establish a model facility to affordably manufacture insulin and 
insulin analogs and to distribute insulin and insulin analogs to residents of the State; and
