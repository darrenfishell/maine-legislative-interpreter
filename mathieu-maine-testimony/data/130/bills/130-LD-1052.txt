Page 1 - 130LR0744(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the rights of citizens of the State regarding firearms, ammunition and 
4 related components are necessary for the citizens' security and safety; and
5Whereas, during times of emergency, firearms, ammunition and related components 
6 are even more necessary for citizens' security and safety; and
7Whereas, in these times of an extended state of emergency, citizens' security and 
8 safety is compromised without the protections of this legislation; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12 therefore,
13Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
