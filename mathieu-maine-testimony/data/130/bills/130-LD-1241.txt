9 A.  The nature of the complaint;
10 B.  The name and contact information of the complainant;
11 C.  The method of submitting the complaint;

22 J.  Possible accommodations or alternatives available as exceptions to requirements.
23Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §2496, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
244.  Complaint; compliance determination.  Upon completion of each complaint 
25 investigation pursuant to subsection 3, the department or delegated municipality shall issue 
26 a finding with respect to compliance with all licensing requirements that determines that

38 designated officer or employee of the department or representative of the delegated 
39 municipality visits an establishment for the purpose of discussing such materials, the owner 
Page 2 - 130LR1774(01)40 or person in charge must be notified no less than 24 hours prior to the visit and the visit

3SUMMARY
4 This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a standard 
5 procedure for investigating complaints against establishments licensed under the Maine 
6 Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 2492, subsection 1.  The bill provides that certain 
7 information must be shared with the owner or person in charge of an establishment that is 
8 the subject of such an investigation, including the name of the complainant, the name of 
9 the department employee investigating the complaint, the laws, rules, executive orders or 
10 policies not being complied with, a corrective action plan, possible accommodations as 
11 alternatives to requirements and the appeals procedures.  The department is required to 
12 issue a finding with respect to compliance.  The bill also requires any scientific or 
13 educational materials that are unrelated to licensing requirements to be clearly identified 
14 this way.  If a representative of the department visits an establishment to discuss these 
15 materials, advance notice must be provided and the visit must take place in ordinary 
16 business hours.  Municipalities that are delegated authority of licensing and inspection by 
17 the department are subject to the same requirements.  Establishments licensed under Title 
18 22, section 2492, subsection 1 are eating establishments, lodging places, recreational or 
19 sporting camps, campgrounds, youth camps, public pools and public spas.1
