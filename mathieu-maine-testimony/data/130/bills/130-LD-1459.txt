Page 3 - 130LR1340(01)14.  Evidence.  The Maine Rules of Evidence do not apply to a hearing on a motion

8 to the special restrictions on dissemination and use of the criminal history record 
9 information relating to the criminal conviction as specified in section 2265 and shall issue

23 to reflect that future dissemination of this criminal history record information must be 
24 pursuant to section 2265 rather than pursuant to Title 16, section 704.  The State Bureau of 
25 Identification shall send notification of compliance with that requirement to the person's 
26 last known address.  
277.  Subsequent new criminal conviction; automatic loss of eligibility; person's duty 
28to notify.  Notwithstanding that a person has been determined by a court pursuant to 
29 subsection 5 to be entitled to the special restrictions on dissemination and use of criminal 
30 history record information relating to a criminal conviction specified in section 2265, if at 
31 any time subsequent to the court's determination the person is convicted of a new crime in 
32 this State or in another jurisdiction, the new conviction extinguishes that entitlement.  In 
33 the event of a new criminal conviction, the person shall promptly file a written notice in 
34 the underlying criminal proceeding of the person's disqualification from entitlement 
35 identifying the new conviction, including the jurisdiction, court and docket number of the 
36 criminal proceeding.  If the person fails to file the required written notice and the court 
37 learns of the existence of the new criminal conviction, the court shall notify the person of 
38 its apparent existence and offer the person an opportunity at a hearing to contest the fact of 
39 a new conviction.  If a hearing is requested by the person, the court shall, after giving notice 
40 to the person and the appropriate prosecutorial office, hold a hearing.  At the hearing, the 
41 person has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the person does not 
42 have the new conviction.  At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court determines that the 
43 person has not satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has been convicted 
44 of the new crime and as a consequence is no longer entitled to the special restrictions on 
45 dissemination and use of the criminal history record information relating to the criminal 
46 conviction as specified in section 2265 and shall issue a written order certifying this 
Page 4 - 130LR1340(01)47 determination.  If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court determines that the person has 
48 satisfied the burden of proof, it shall find that the person has not been convicted of the new 
49 crime and issue a written order certifying this determination.  The order must contain 
50 written findings of fact supporting the court's determination.  A copy of the court's written 
51 order must be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that represented the State.
68.  Notice to State Bureau of Identification of new crime.  If the court determines 
7 under subsection 7 that a person has been convicted of a new crime and as a consequence 
8 is no longer eligible for the special restrictions on dissemination and use of the criminal 
9 history record information relating to the criminal conviction as specified in section 2265, 
10 a copy of the court's written order certifying its determination must be provided to the 
11 Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, State Bureau of Identification.  The 
12 State Bureau of Identification upon receipt of the order shall promptly amend its records 
13 relating to the person's criminal conviction to reflect that dissemination of this criminal 
14 history record information is pursuant to Title 16, section 704 rather than pursuant to 
15 section 2265.  The State Bureau of Identification shall send notification of compliance with 
16 that requirement to the person's last known address.

Page 6 - 130LR1340(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill replaces the special process to seal certain criminal records, found in the 
3 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, chapter 310, that was repealed by its own terms on 
4 October 1, 2019.
5 The bill uses the same process to seal criminal records of an eligible criminal 
6 conviction as in the repealed law.  The bill defines "eligible criminal conviction" to include 
7 all current and former Class D and Class E crimes except for:
8 1.  Class D crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 11, Sexual Assaults;
9 2.  Class D crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 12, Sexual Exploitation of Minors;
10 3.  The Class D and Class E crimes of aggravated sex trafficking, sex trafficking and 
11 patronizing prostitution of a minor or a person with a mental disability;
12 4.  Stalking and domestic violence stalking;
13 5.  Any crime involving domestic violence, unless the sentence has been commuted;
14 6.  A crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since 
15 entry of the judgment of conviction;
16 7.  A conviction for a violation of a condition of release for a charge that involves a 
17 crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since entry of the 
18 judgment of conviction;
19 8.  A conviction for a violation of a protective order under Title 5, section 4659, 
20 subsection 2; Title 15, section 321, subsection 6; Title 17-A, section 506-B; Title 19-A, 
21 section 4011, subsection 3; or Title 19-A, section 4012, subsection 5; and
22 9.  A conviction for cruelty to animals.
23 A person with an eligible criminal conviction may file a motion for the special 
24 restrictions on dissemination and use of criminal history record information for an eligible 
25 criminal conviction if at least 4 years have passed since the person fully satisfied each of 
26 the sentencing alternatives imposed for the conviction; the person has not been convicted 
27 of another criminal violation in this State, and has not had a criminal charge dismissed as 
28 a result of a deferred disposition, since satisfying the sentencing alternatives; the person 
29 has no criminal convictions in another jurisdiction since satisfying the sentencing 
30 alternatives; and the person has no presently pending criminal charges in this State or in 
31 another jurisdiction.
32 The court must hold a hearing on the motion and, if the court determines all the 
33 requirements have been met, the court must find the person entitled to the special 
34 restrictions on dissemination and issue a written order certifying the determination.  A copy 
35 of the order must be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that prosecuted the 
36 person.  The order must also be provided to the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of 
37 State Police, State Bureau of Identification, which must promptly amend its records relating 
38 to the eligible criminal conviction.
39 If the person is convicted of a crime after the court's order, the new conviction 
40 extinguishes the entitlement.  The person is required to file notice of the new conviction, 
41 but if the person does not do so, the court is required to notify the person of the new 
42 conviction and offer an opportunity for a hearing to contest the fact of the new conviction.  2

Page 7 - 130LR1340(01)43 If the court determines that there is a new criminal conviction, the court must issue an order 
44 that the person is no longer eligible to have the criminal record sealed.  That order must be 
45 submitted to the State Bureau of Identification.
4 When a person's records are subject to the special restrictions on dissemination and 
5 use, the criminal history record information is confidential and may not be disseminated by 
6 a criminal justice agency to anyone except the following for limited purposes:  the person; 
7 a criminal justice agency; the Secretary of State; victims; the Department of Professional 
8 and Financial Regulation, Office of Securities; and financial institutions.  The criminal 
9 history record information may also be disseminated pursuant to court order.
10 A person whose criminal conviction is covered by the special restrictions on 
11 dissemination and use may respond to inquiries from other than criminal justice agencies 
12 by not disclosing its existence without being subject to any sanctions.
13 The State may appeal as of right an order to seal a record; the person may appeal, but 
14 not as of right, when the court does not order the record sealed.1
