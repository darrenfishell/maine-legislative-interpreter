3 affected by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
41.  Presumption; appointment of attorney required.  There is a presumption that 
5 every respondent and adult subject to guardianship is entitled to legal representation.  In 
6 any proceeding on a petition under section 5-302, the court shall appoint an attorney for an 
7 unrepresented respondent or adult subject to guardianship.  This presumption may be 
8 rebutted if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent or adult 
9 subject to guardianship knowingly and voluntarily refuses such representation and does not 
10 wish to contest any aspect of the proceeding or to seek any limitation on the guardian's 
11 powers.
12Sec. 2.  18-C MRSA §5-406, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and

15 every respondent and adult subject to conservatorship is entitled to legal representation.  In 
16 any proceeding on a petition under section 5-402, the court shall appoint an attorney for an 
17 unrepresented respondent or adult subject to conservatorship.  This presumption may be 
18 rebutted if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent or adult 
19 subject to conservatorship knowingly and voluntarily refuses such representation and does 
20 not wish to contest any aspect of the proceeding or to seek any limitation on the 
21 conservator's powers.
22Sec. 3.  18-C MRSA §5-507, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 and 
23 affected by PL 2019, c. 417, Pt. B, §14, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
241.  Presumption; appointment of attorney required.  There is a presumption that 
25 every respondent and adult subject to a protective arrangement is entitled to legal 
26 representation.  In a proceeding under this Part, the court shall appoint an attorney for an 
27 unrepresented respondent or adult subject to a protective arrangement.  This presumption 
28 may be rebutted if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent or 
29 adult subject to a protective arrangement knowingly and voluntarily refuses such 
30 representation and does not wish to contest any aspect of the proceeding or to seek any 
31 limitation to the protective arrangement.
32SUMMARY
33 This bill establishes a presumption that every adult in a guardianship, conservatorship 
34 or other protective arrangement proceeding is entitled to legal representation when not 
35 already represented and requires the court to appoint an attorney, except that the 
36 presumption may be rebutted if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 
37 adult knowingly and voluntarily refuses such representation and does not wish to contest 
38 any aspect of the proceeding or powers of the guardian or conservator or limitation to the 
39 protective arrangement.
