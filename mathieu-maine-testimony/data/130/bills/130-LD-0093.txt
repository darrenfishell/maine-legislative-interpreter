Page 1 - 130LR0065(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง3737, sub-ยง3, as corrected by RR 2015, c. 1, ยง21, is amended 
3 to read:
43.  Quality differential.  To the extent permitted by federal law, the department shall 
5 pay a differential rate for child care services that meet or that make substantial progress 
6 toward meeting nationally recognized quality standards, such as those standards required 
7 by the Head Start program or required for accreditation by the National Association for the 
8 Education of Young Children, and shall do so from the Child Care Development Fund 25% 
9 Quality Set-aside funds or by other acceptable federal practices.  Rules adopted pursuant 
10 to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
11 2-A.  The rules must establish a 4-step child care quality rating system with a minimum of 
12 3 steps and must provide for graduated quality differential rates for step 2, step 3 and step 
13 4 child care services  steps that demonstrate that a child care provider meets or makes 
14 substantial progress toward meeting nationally recognized quality standards.
15 Nothing in this subsection requires the department to pay a quality differential rate for child 
16 care services provided through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill removes language that requires a 4-step quality rating system for child care 
19 providers and instead allows the Department of Health and Human Services discretion in 
20 setting the appropriate number of steps, with a minimum of 3 steps required.
