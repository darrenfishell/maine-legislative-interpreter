Page 1 - 130LR0207(01)1Preamble.  Two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature deeming it necessary in 
2 accordance with the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 14 to authorize the issuance 
3 of bonds on behalf of the State of Maine to provide funds as described in this Act,
4Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
5PART A
6Sec. A-1.  Authorization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized, under the 
7 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
8 amount not exceeding $35,000,000 for the purposes described in section 6 of this Part.  The 
9 bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for a 
10 period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
11Sec. A-2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State.  The Treasurer of State 
12 shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the name 
13 of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of sale 
14 and the date when payable.
15Sec. A-3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of 
16 State may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may 
17 be loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
18 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
19 upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
20 forth in this Part.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
21 in this Part lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
22 general obligation bonds.
23Sec. A-4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay interest 
24 due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Part and all sums coming due for payment 
25 of bonds at maturity.
26Sec. A-5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds.  The proceeds of the bonds must be 
27 expended as set out in this Part under the direction and supervision of the Department of 
28 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
29 1.  The proceeds of the bonds for the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in section 
30 6 must be expended by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry for 
31 acquisition of land and interest in land for conservation, water access, outdoor recreation, 
32 wildlife and fish habitat, working farmland preservation in accordance with the provisions 
33 for such acquisitions under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 and working 
34 waterfront protection in accordance with the terms of Public Law 2005, chapter 462, Part 
35 B, section 6, including all costs associated with such acquisitions, except that use of the 
36 proceeds of these bonds is subject to the following conditions and requirements.
37 A.  Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on land acquired 
38 with bond proceeds, except to the extent of applicable state, local or federal laws, rules 
39 and regulations and except for working waterfront projects and working farmland 
40 preservation projects.
41 B.  Payment from bond proceeds for acquisitions of local or regional significance, as 
42 determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board, may be made directly to cooperating 
43 entities as defined in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2 for acquisition of land and 
Page 2 - 130LR0207(01)44 interest in land by cooperating entities, subject to terms and conditions enforceable by 
45 the State to ensure its use for the purposes of this Part. In addition to the considerations 
46 required under Title 5, chapter 353, the board shall give a preference to acquisitions 
47 under this paragraph that achieve benefits for multiple towns and that address regional 
48 conservation needs including public recreational access, wildlife, open space and 
49 farmland.
7 C.  The bond funds expended for conservation, recreation, working waterfronts, 
8 working farmland and water access must be matched with at least $30,000,000 in 
9 public and private contributions.  Seventy percent of that amount must be in the form 
10 of cash or other tangible assets, including the value of land and real property interest 
11 acquired by or contributed to cooperating entities, as defined in Title 5, section 6201, 
12 subsection 2, when property interests have a direct relationship to the property 
13 proposed for protection, as determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board.  The 
14 remaining 30% may be matching contributions and may include the value of project-
15 related, in-kind contributions of goods and services to and by cooperating entities.
16 D.  Because portions of the State have deer populations that are struggling and deer 
17 wintering habitat protection is vital to the survival and enhancement of these 
18 populations, projects that conserve and protect deer wintering areas are considered to 
19 have special value and must receive preferential consideration during scoring of new 
20 applications for support under Title 5, chapter 353.
21 E.  To the extent the purposes are consistent with the disbursement provisions in this 
22 Part, 100% of the bond proceeds may be considered as state match for any federal 
23 funding to be made available to the State.
24 2.  The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of 
25 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall take a proactive approach to pursuing land conservation 
26 projects that include conservation of priority deer wintering areas.  In order to be subject 
27 to this designation, priority deer wintering areas must be of at least 500 acres or contiguous 
28 with existing conservation land so that the combined acreage constitutes at least 500 acres, 
29 must have been historically used by deer at some point since 1950 and must be capable of 
30 providing shelter for deer on the effective date of this Part or within 20 years of the effective 
31 date of this Part.  The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall include in 
32 conservation negotiations under this section provisions for the appropriate management of 
33 priority deer wintering areas.  Land and interest in land purchased by the State that contains 
34 priority deer wintering areas must be managed using protocol provided by the Department 
35 of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
36 3.  Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
37 section 6, at least 5% must be made available to acquire public access to water in 
38 accordance with Title 5, section 6203-A.
39 4.  Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
40 section 6, at least 10% must be made available to protect farmland in accordance with Title 
41 5, section 6207.
42 5.  Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
43 section 6, at least 10% must be made available to protect working waterfront properties in 
44 accordance with Public Law 2005, chapter 462, Part B, section 6.1
