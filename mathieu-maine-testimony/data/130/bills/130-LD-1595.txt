10SUMMARY
11 This bill provides for the stewardship of solar panel waste.   It amends the Maine Solar 
12 Energy Act to provide for the prevention or minimization of the potential damage from 
13 solar panel deterioration and for a tracking system for solar panels.  It provides that property 
14 with solar panels must be insured to pay the full costs of recycling the solar panels damaged 
15 in any form of catastrophe and that these insurance costs be paid first from any distributions 
16 of insurance proceeds.  It provides for state grant funding for the development of a recycling 
17 process that recycles 95% of solar panels and the design and construction of recycling 
18 equipment and a recycling facility, using funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas 
19 Initiative Trust Fund and, if needed, funds from the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund, 
20 the Maine Solid Waste Diversion Grant Program and the Maine Technology Institute.  It 
21 provides for penalties for improper disposal of solar energy equipment, for failure to 
22 register solar energy equipment and for refusal to permit inspection of solar energy 
23 equipment.  It replaces the term "solar energy device" with the term "solar energy 
24 equipment," which is defined under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 1492, 
25 subsection 1.  It corrects cross-references in the provision of law allowing the 
26 Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services to establish an energy 
27 infrastructure benefits fund.  It amends the Energy Conservation in Buildings Act provision 
28 regarding life-cycle costs to provide that Department of Administrative and Financial 
29 Services, Bureau of General Services rules include the costs of recycling in determining 
30 the effect of insulation incorporated into a facility design and the effect on solar utilization 
31 to the properties of external surfaces and the cost-effectiveness of integrating wind or solar 
32 electricity-generating equipment into the design and construction of a facility.  11
