interest in an entity, including as a shareholder of a corporation, that also holds an 
aquaculture lease. It allows a license holder to designate one unlicensed individual as a 
primary assistant who may conduct the licensed activities without the direct supervision of 
the license holder.

This bill amends certain rules regarding aquaculture leasing and licenses. It also increases the fee for a resident 
limited-purpose aquaculture license from $50 to $100 and increases the fee for a nonresident lim,ted-purpose 
aquaculture license from $300 to $400 starting January 1, 2022. This will increase Other Special Revenue Funds 
revenue to the Aquaculture Management Fund (AMF) in the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) by $20,000 in 
fiscal year 2021-22 and by $40,000 in subsequent years. The bill includes a corresponding ongoing allocation to the 
DMR to allow for expenditure of the additional revenue. Provisions in this bill that allow the DMR to establish fees 
for modifications of leases and product safety testing will increase revenues to the Shellfish Fund. An estimate of 
these revenues is not made at this time but is not anticipated to be significant.
