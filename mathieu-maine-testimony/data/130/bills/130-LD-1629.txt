Page 1 - 130LR2026(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  32 MRSA ยง3271, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 189, ยง2, is further 
3 amended to read:
42.  Postgraduate training.  Each applicant who has graduated from an accredited 
5 medical school on or after January 1, 1970 but before July 1, 2004 must have satisfactorily 
6 completed at least 24 months in a graduate educational program accredited by the 
7 Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Canadian Medical Association 
8 or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.  Notwithstanding other 
9 requirements of postgraduate training, an applicant is eligible for licensure when the 
10 candidate has satisfactorily graduated from a combined postgraduate training program in 
11 which each of the contributing programs is accredited by the Accreditation Council on 
12 Graduate Medical Education and the applicant is eligible for accreditation by the American 
13 Board of Medical Specialties in both specialties.  Each applicant who has graduated from 
14 an accredited medical school prior to January 1, 1970 must have satisfactorily completed 
15 at least 12 months in a graduate educational program accredited by the Accreditation 
16 Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Canadian Medical Association or the Royal 
17 College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.  Each applicant who has graduated from 
18 an accredited medical school on or after July 1, 2004 or an unaccredited medical school 
19 must have satisfactorily completed at least 36 months in a graduate educational program 
20 accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Canadian 
21 Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada or the Royal 
22 Colleges of England, Ireland or Scotland.  An applicant who has completed 24 months of 
23 postgraduate training and has received an unrestricted endorsement from the director of an 
24 accredited graduate education program in the State is considered to have satisfied the 
25 postgraduate training requirements of this subsection if the applicant continues in that 
26 program and completes 36 months of postgraduate training.  Notwithstanding this 
27 subsection, an applicant who is board certified by the American Board of Medical 
28 Specialties is deemed to meet the postgraduate training requirements of this subsection.  
29 Notwithstanding this subsection, in the case of subspecialty or clinical fellowship 
30 programs, the board may accept in fulfillment of the requirements of this subsection 
31 postgraduate training at a hospital in which the subspecialty clinical program, such as a 
32 training program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental 
33 Accreditation or its successor organization, is not accredited but the parent specialty 
34 program is accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education.  
35 Notwithstanding this subsection, an applicant is deemed to meet the postgraduate training 
36 requirements of this subsection if the applicant has graduated from an oral and 
37 maxillofacial surgery training program accredited by the American Dental Association 
38 Commission on Dental Accreditation or its successor organization, graduated from a 
39 medical school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or its successor 
40 organization that is associated with the training program and completed 24 months of 
41 postgraduate training in a program accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate 
42 Medical Education.
43 The board may not require an applicant for initial licensure or license renewal as a 
44 physician under this chapter to obtain certification from a specialty medical board or to 
45 obtain a maintenance of certification as a condition of licensure.  For the purposes of this 
46 subsection, "maintenance of certification" means a program that requires a physician to 
Page 2 - 130LR2026(01)47 engage in periodic examination, self-assessment, peer evaluation or other activities to 
48 maintain certification from a specialty medical board.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill provides that an applicant for licensure as a physician or surgeon in the State 
5 satisfies the postgraduate training requirements if the applicant graduates from an oral and 
6 maxillofacial surgery program accredited by the American Dental Association Commission 
7 on Dental Accreditation, graduates from a medical school associated with the training 
8 program that is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Accreditation and 
9 completes 24 months of postgraduate training at a program accredited by the Accreditation 
10 Council on Graduate Medical Education.1
