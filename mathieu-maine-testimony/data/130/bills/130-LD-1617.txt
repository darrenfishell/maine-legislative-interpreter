3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to amend the Maine Juvenile Code and the Maine Criminal Code to 
6 incorporate the principles and values of restorative justice.  Restorative justice is a 
7 mechanism to address crime, disputes and community conflict through one or more 
8 meetings that are facilitated by one or more trained and impartial individuals and that 
9 include the victim, offender and representatives of the community.  A central focus of 
10 restorative justice is identifying the harm caused by the offender, attempting to make 
11 amends and promoting reintegration while emphasizing the importance of community 
12 partnership and engagement.4
