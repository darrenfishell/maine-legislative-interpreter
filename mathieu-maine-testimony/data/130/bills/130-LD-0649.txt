26 available to the provider and the patient.  It also provides that a provider not licensed in the

32 Medicine's approval of a physician not licensed in the State to provide telehealth services 
33 in the State if the physician meets certain criteria and reduces from $500 to $300 the fee 
34 the physician must pay to become registered to practice telehealth services in the State.23
