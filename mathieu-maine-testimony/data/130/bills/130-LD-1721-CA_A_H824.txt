general requirements and responsibilities of facility boards of visitors and to clarify the 
membership of boards of visitors for women's services.

in correctional facilities or detention facilities to specify the conditions under which such 
visits are not allowed. 
5. It amends the provision of the bill requiring a correctional facility or detention 
facility to ensure the presence of a female law enforcement officer during the transportation 
of a female prisoner to and from medical appointments by providing that a correctional 
facility or detention facility is required to ensure the presence of a female corrections officer 
to the greatest extent practicable. The amendment also adds a similar provision applicable 
to county jails.
