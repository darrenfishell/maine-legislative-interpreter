Page 1 - 130LR2022(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  10 MRSA §1107, first ¶, as amended by PL 1991, c. 137, §4, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 The Attorney General upon the Attorney General's own initiative or upon petition of 
5 50 or more citizens of this State, shall investigate all seeming violations of sections 1102-A 
6 and 1105 to 1107, all contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or 
7 commerce, and all monopolies, and may require, by summons, the attendance and 
8 testimony of witnesses and the production of books and papers before the Attorney General 
9 relating to any such matter under investigation.  The summons must be served in the same 
10 manner as summons for witnesses in criminal cases, and all provisions of law relating 
11 thereto apply to summonses issued under this section so far as they are applicable.  All 
12 investigations or hearings thereunder or connected therewith to which witnesses are 
13 summoned or called upon to testify or to produce books, records or correspondence are 
14 public or private at the choice of the person summoned confidential and must be held in 
15 the county where the act to be investigated is alleged to have been committed, or if the 
16 investigation is on petition it must be held in the county in which the petitioners reside.  
17 Books, records or correspondence produced in response to a summons issued under this 
18 section may be disclosed by the Attorney General with the consent of the producing party 
19 and in court pleadings or other papers filed in court.  The expense of such investigation 
20 must be paid from the appropriation provided by Title 5, section 203.
21Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §550-B, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2013, c. 405, Pt. C, §7, is 
22 further amended to read:
236.  Information use.  Information collected by the Division of Geology, Natural Areas 
24 and Coastal Resources, Maine Geological Survey under this section is subject to Title 1, 
25 chapter 13, subchapter 1, unless the well drilling company to whom the information 
26 belongs or pertains requests that it be designated as confidential and the bureau has 
27 determined it contains proprietary information. For the purposes of this subsection, 
28 "proprietary information" means information that is a trade secret or production, 
29 commercial or financial information the disclosure of which would impair the competitive 
30 position of the person submitting the information and would make available information 
31 not otherwise publicly available.  The Division of Geology, Natural Areas and Coastal 
32 Resources, Maine Geological Survey shall make information collected under this chapter 
33 available to any federal, state or municipal entity or authorized agent of such entity.
34SUMMARY
35 This bill implements statutory changes recommended by the Right To Know Advisory 
36 Committee after reviewing certain existing public records exceptions in the Maine Revised 
37 Statutes, Titles 8 to 12. 
38 The bill amends a provision relating to books, records or correspondence produced in 
39 response to a summons in an antitrust investigation.  It makes the language consistent with 
40 how other exceptions refer to documents that are not subject to disclosure and clarifies that 
41 the confidentiality of the records is not tethered to an affirmative option of the person 
42 providing the records.  It further clarifies that books, records or correspondence produced 
43 in response to a summons may be disclosed by the Attorney General with the consent of 
44 the producing party and in court pleadings or other papers filed in court.35

2 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Division of Geology, Natural Areas 
3 and Coastal Resources, Maine Geological Survey.  It removes the exception designating as 
4 confidential information collected by the Maine Geological Survey at the request of well 
5 drilling companies to whom the information pertains if the division has determined it 
6 contains proprietary information.
