further amended to read:

the county where the offense is prosecuted if the identity of the victim cannot be 
ascertained or if the victim voluntarily refuses the restitution. If the court orders as a 
condition of probation that the person forfeit and pay a specific amount of restitution,

unnecessary;

intervention program unless the program is certified under Title 19-A, section 4014;
