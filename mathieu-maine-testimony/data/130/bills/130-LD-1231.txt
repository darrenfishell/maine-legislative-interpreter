9SUMMARY
10 This bill does the following.
11 1.  It requires projects involving the construction of renewable energy generating 
12 systems that are receiving at least $50,000 in state assistance to meet certain requirements, 
13 including the following.
14 A.  The entity responsible for the assisted project must establish a workforce 
15 development program that provides employees from disadvantaged communities 
16 opportunities for skill development and that also provides apprenticeship training 
17 through a registered apprenticeship program for each trade in which the employer 
18 employs craft workers.
19 B.  A contractor working on the assisted project must provide or participate in a 
20 registered apprenticeship training program for each trade in which it employs craft 
21 workers.
22 C.  A contractor or subcontractor working on the assisted project must pay craft 
23 workers on the project no less than the applicable prevailing wage and benefits, and 
24 the entity responsible for the assisted project that is receiving state assistance for that 
25 project must take reasonable steps to ensure that all contractors and subcontractors 
26 meet this requirement.  This requirement does not apply, however, if the entity 
27 responsible for the assisted project has ensured that the entity directly responsible for 
28 the construction of the project has entered into a project labor agreement that meets 
29 certain requirements.
30 D.  If the assisted project involves a renewable energy project with a generation 
31 capacity of 50 megawatts or more, the entity responsible for the project is required to 
32 ensure that a project labor agreement is executed between the entity directly 
33 responsible for construction of the project and a labor organization to supply skilled 
34 craft workers in all crafts needed for the project in the area where the project is located.
35 E.  Employers working on an assisted project are required to adopt any hiring policies 
36 established by the Department of Labor by rule that require employers working on 
37 assisted projects to adopt and maintain hiring policies that will attract and retain a 
38 diverse workforce.  The department may adopt incentives for adopting such policies 
39 rather than establishing requirements. 
40 2.  It amends the definition of "electrical installation" in the law governing the licensing 
41 of electricians.  Under the law, undertaking an electrical installation generally requires a 
42 license.  The bill defines an electrical installation of a photovoltaic system to include the 
43 installation of supporting structures, such as frames, racks, rails, purlins and any part of the 1
