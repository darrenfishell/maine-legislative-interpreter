Page 1 - 130LR0703(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §3651, first ¶, as amended by PL 1977, c. 363, §5, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 Highways, town ways and streets legally established shall must be opened and kept in 
5 repair so as to be safe and convenient for travelers with motor vehicles.  In default thereof, 
6 those liable may be indicted, convicted and a reasonable fine imposed therefor.  
7 Notwithstanding this paragraph, if a road or a discontinued town way pursuant to section 
8 3026-A in which a town holds a public easement is the only road or way that can be used 
9 to access one or more residences and the town issues permits for residential use of 
10 residences or collects property taxes on those residences, the town is not required to keep 
11 the road or way safe and convenient for travelers with motor vehicles but must provide 
12 sufficient maintenance to keep the road or way passable to access the residences on the 
13 road or way, as determined by the county commissioners.
14Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §3652 is amended to read:
15§3652.  Notice of defect; hearing on petition
16 When a town liable to maintain a way unreasonably neglects to keep it in repair as 
17 provided in section 3651, after one of the municipal officers has had 5 days' actual notice 
18 or knowledge of the defective condition, any 3 or more responsible persons, or one or more 
19 residents on the road or the discontinued town way pursuant to section 3026-A in which a 
20 town holds a public easement if that road or way is the only road or way that can be used 
21 to access one or more residences as provided in section 3651, may petition the county 
22 commissioners for the county, setting forth such facts, who, if satisfied that such petitioners 
23 are responsible for the costs of the proceedings, shall fix a time and place near such 
24 defective way for a hearing on such petition and cause such notice thereof to be given to 
25 the town and petitioners as they may prescribe.  At the time appointed, the commissioners 
26 shall view the way alleged to be out of repair and hear the parties interested, and if they 
27 adjudge the way to be unsafe and inconvenient for travelers, motor vehicles, horses, teams 
28 and carriages, or in the case of a road or a discontinued town way pursuant to section 
29 3026-A in which a town holds a public easement if that road or way is the only road or way 
30 that can be used to access one or more residences as provided in section 3651 adjudge the 
31 road or way to be not passable, they shall prescribe what repairs shall be made, fix the time 
32 in which the town shall make them, give notice thereof to the municipal officers and award 
33 the costs of the proceedings against the town.  If they adjudge the way to be safe and 
34 convenient, or in the case of a road or a discontinued town way pursuant to section 3026-A 
35 in which a town holds a public easement if that road or way is the only road or way that 
36 can be used to access one or more residences as provided in section 3651 adjudge the road 
37 or way to be not passable to access the resources on the road or way, they shall dismiss the 
38 petition and award the costs against the petitioners.  If they find that the way was defective 
39 at the time of presentation of the petition, but has been repaired before the hearing, they 
40 may award the costs against the town, if in their judgment justice requires it.
41SUMMARY
