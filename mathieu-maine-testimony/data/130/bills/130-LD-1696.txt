9CHAPTER 103
10PROTECTION FROM ABUSE
11§4101.  Purposes
12 The court shall liberally construe and apply this chapter to promote the following 
13 underlying purposes:  
141.  Recognition.  To recognize domestic abuse as a serious crime against the individual 
15 and society, producing an unhealthy and dangerous family environment, resulting in a 
16 pattern of escalating abuse, including violence, that frequently culminates in intrafamily 
17 homicide and creating an atmosphere that is not conducive to healthy childhood 
18 development;
192.  Protection.  To allow family and household members who are victims of domestic 
20 abuse to obtain expeditious and effective protection against further abuse so that the lives 
21 of the nonabusing family or household members are as secure and uninterrupted as 
22 possible;
233.  Enforcement.  To provide protection by promptly entering and diligently enforcing 
24 court orders that prohibit abuse and, when necessary, by reducing the abuser's access to the 
25 victim and addressing related issues of parental rights and responsibilities and economic 
26 support so that victims are not trapped in abusive situations by fear of retaliation, loss of a 
27 child or financial dependence;
284.  Prevention.  To expand the power of the justice system to respond effectively to 
29 situations of domestic abuse, to clarify the responsibilities and support the efforts of law 
30 enforcement officers, prosecutors and judicial officers to provide immediate, effective 
31 assistance and protection for victims of abuse and to recognize the crucial role of law 
32 enforcement officers in preventing further incidents of abuse and in assisting the victims 
33 of abuse;
345.  Data collection.  To provide for the collection of data concerning domestic abuse 
35 in an effort to develop a comprehensive analysis of the incidence and causes of that abuse; 
36 and
376.  Mutual order.  To declare that a mutual order of protection or restraint undermines 
38 the purposes of this chapter.5

24 provided by the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. Appeals may be only for error of law or 
25 abuse of discretion.
267.  Mediation and referees.  The court may not mandate mediation or appointment of

29 prohibit the court from mandating mediation or the appointment of a referee on any issue, 
30 other than abuse, that is part of the other proceeding.
31§4107.  Service of order  
32 If the court issues an order under this chapter, the court shall order an appropriate law

46 transmitted directly from the court to the law enforcement agency or correctional facility 
47 making service.  Return of proof of service may be made by electronic transmission of the 
48 proof of service directly to the court from the law enforcement officer making service or 
49 the chief administrative officer, or the chief administrative officer's designee, of the 
50 correctional facility making service.
72.  Officer who served order as witness.  In any subsequent criminal prosecution for 
8 violation of this chapter when the service of an order was made through the use of an 
9 electronically transmitted printed copy of the order, with 10 days' advance written notice 
10 to the prosecution, the defendant may request that the prosecution call as a witness the law 
11 enforcement officer who served the order or the chief administrative officer, or the chief 
12 administrative officer's designee, of the correctional facility that served the order.
13§4108.  Temporary orders
141.  Temporary orders.  The court may enter temporary orders authorized under 
15 subsection 2 that it considers necessary to protect a plaintiff or minor child from abuse, on 
16 good cause shown in an ex parte proceeding, which the court shall hear and determine as 
17 expeditiously as practicable after the filing of a complaint.  Immediate and present danger 
18 of abuse to the plaintiff or minor child constitutes good cause.  A temporary order remains 
19 in effect pending a hearing pursuant to section 4109.
202.  Interim relief.  The court, in an ex parte proceeding, may enter temporary orders: 
21 A.  Concerning the parental rights and responsibilities relating to minor children for

37 prohibited pursuant to Title 17-A, section 511-A; or  
38 (8)  Destroying, transferring or tampering with the plaintiff's passport or other 
39 immigration document in the defendant's possession; or  1

6
Page 8 - 130LR1600(01)1 C.  Concerning the care, custody or control of any animal owned, possessed, leased, 
2 kept or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household and may enjoin 
3 the defendant from injuring or threatening to injure any such animal.
43.  Temporary orders; possession of dangerous weapons.  The court may direct the 
5 defendant not to possess a firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, bow, crossbow or other 
6 dangerous weapon for the duration of the temporary order if the complaint demonstrates:
7 A.  Abuse that involves a firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, bow, crossbow or other 
8 dangerous weapon; or  
9 B.  A heightened risk of immediate abuse to the plaintiff or a minor child.  In 
10 determining whether a heightened risk of immediate abuse is present, the court shall 
11 consider, but is not limited to consideration of, whether:
12 (1)  The temporary order of protection is not likely to achieve its purpose in the 
13 absence of such a condition;
14 (2)  The defendant has violated orders of protection;
15 (3)  Past or present abuse to a victim resulted in injury;
16 (4)  The abuse occurred in public; and
17 (5)  The abuse includes:
18 (a)  Threats of suicide or homicide;
19 (b)  Killing or threatening to kill any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept or 
20 held by either party or a minor child residing in the household;
21 (c)  An escalation of violence;
22 (d)  Stalking behavior or extreme obsession;
23 (e)  Sexual violence;
24 (f)  Excessive alcohol or drug use; and
25 (g)  Abuse against a pregnant victim.
26 If the court prohibits the defendant from possessing a firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, 
27 bow, crossbow or other dangerous weapon in a temporary order and if the defendant moves 
28 for dissolution or modification of a temporary order pursuant to subsection 6, the court 
29 shall hear and decide the motion as expeditiously as possible and shall issue a written 
30 decision on the motion within 24 hours after a hearing on that motion.
31 If the court prohibits the defendant from possessing a dangerous weapon other than a 
32 firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, bow or crossbow in a temporary order, the court shall 
33 specify the type of weapon the defendant is prohibited from possessing.
34 If the court prohibits the defendant from possessing a firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, 
35 bow, crossbow or other dangerous weapon in a temporary order, the court shall direct the 
36 defendant to relinquish, within 24 hours after service of the temporary order on the 
37 defendant or such earlier time as the court specifies in the temporary order, all firearms, 
38 muzzle-loading firearms, bows, crossbows and specified dangerous weapons in the 
39 possession of the defendant to a law enforcement officer or other individual for the duration 
40 of the temporary order.  If the weapons are relinquished to an individual other than a law 
Page 9 - 130LR1600(01)41 enforcement officer, the defendant must file, within 24 hours after such relinquishment, 
42 with the court or local law enforcement agency designated in the temporary order a written 
43 statement that contains the name and address of the individual holding the weapons and a 
44 description of all weapons held by that individual.  The court may subsequently issue a 
45 search warrant authorizing a law enforcement officer to seize any firearms, muzzle-loading 
46 firearms, bows, crossbows and other dangerous weapons at any location if there is probable 
47 cause to believe such firearms, muzzle-loading firearms, bows, crossbows or dangerous 
48 weapons have not been relinquished by the defendant.
94.  Emergency relief.  Emergency relief is available as follows.
10 A.  When there is no judge available in the District Court having venue or the District 
11 Court courthouse is closed and no other provision can be made for the shelter of an 
12 abused family or household member or minor child, a complaint may be presented to 
13 another District Court Judge or Superior Court Justice.  Upon a showing of good cause, 
14 as described in subsection 1, the court may enter temporary orders authorized under 
15 this section that it considers necessary to protect the plaintiff or minor child from abuse. 
16 B.  If a complaint is presented under this subsection, that complaint and any temporary 
17 order issued pursuant to it must be forwarded immediately to the clerk of the District 
18 Court having venue for filing.  
19 C.  A temporary order under this subsection remains in effect pending a hearing 
20 pursuant to section 4109.
215.  Denial of relief.  Before a request for temporary, emergency or interim relief is 
22 denied, the judge shall:
23 A.  Allow the plaintiff the opportunity to be heard in person to support the complaint.  
24 The plaintiff may be accompanied by a person of the plaintiff's choice; and  
25 B.  Advise the plaintiff of reasons for the denial.  
266.  Dissolution or modification.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 
27 upon 2 days' notice to the plaintiff or upon such shorter notice as the court may order, a 
28 person who is subject to a temporary order may appear and move the dissolution or 
29 modification of the temporary order and, in that event, the court shall proceed to hear and 
30 determine the motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require. At that hearing, the 
31 plaintiff has the burden of justifying a finding in the temporary order that the defendant has 
32 challenged by affidavit. This subsection may not be construed to abolish or limit any means 
33 otherwise available by law for obtaining dissolution, modification or discharge of a 
34 temporary order.
357.  Extension.  If a hearing on the complaint is continued, the court may make or extend 
36 temporary orders it considers necessary.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to 
37 the contrary, if a final protection order is issued pursuant to section 4110, the temporary 
38 protection order issued pursuant to this section remains in effect pending service of the 
39 final protection order.
40§4109.  Hearings
411.  Full hearing.  Within 21 days of the filing of a complaint, a hearing must be held 
42 at which the plaintiff must prove the allegation of abuse or conduct specified in section 
43 4103 by a preponderance of the evidence.  If a request for temporary, emergency or interim 1

8
Page 10 - 130LR1600(01)44 relief is denied, the hearing must be held as soon as practicable within the 21-day period.  
45 Nothing in this section limits the court's discretion to continue the final hearing upon the 
46 court's own motion or upon the motion of either party. 
42.  Self-defense.  The right to relief under this chapter is not affected by the plaintiff's 
5 use of reasonable force in response to abuse by the defendant.
63.  Intoxication.  Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to an action under this chapter.
7§4110.  Relief
81.  Final protection order.  The court, after a hearing or opportunity for hearing and 
9 upon finding that the defendant has committed the abuse or conduct specified in section 
10 4103, may grant a final protection order to bring about the cessation of the abuse or alleged 
11 conduct.  The court may enter a finding that the defendant represents a credible threat to 
12 the physical safety of the plaintiff or a minor child residing in the household.  The court 
13 may enter a finding of economic abuse.  
142.  Final protection order by consent.  The court may approve a final protection order 
15 by consent if all parties agree to the terms, including whether an order under this section 
16 includes findings by the court.

8 rights and responsibilities or rights of contact is not binding in any separate action

10 a similar action brought in another jurisdiction exercising child custody jurisdiction in 
11 accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act;  
12 J.  With respect to unauthorized dissemination of certain private images as described

24 L.   Ordering the termination of a life insurance policy or rider under that policy owned

39 In all proceedings under this chapter, the court shall apply the child support guidelines 
40 in chapter 63 using the information the plaintiff is able to provide the court.  Failure of 
41 a party to file an income affidavit may not unnecessarily delay a proceeding and does 
42 not preclude the issuance of an order for child support, except that the court shall 
Page 12 - 130LR1600(01)43 require the plaintiff to complete and file an income affidavit at a final hearing involving 
44 child support even if the defendant does not appear for the hearing;
3 P.  Ordering payment of monetary relief to the plaintiff for losses suffered as a result 
4 of the defendant's conduct.  Monetary relief includes but is not limited to loss of

7 motion of either party, for sufficient cause, the court may set a later hearing on the issue 
8 of the amount of monetary relief, if any, to be awarded.  Nothing in this paragraph may 
9 be construed to limit the court's discretion to enter any of the other available relief 
10 under this chapter.  Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to preclude a plaintiff 
11 from seeking monetary relief through other actions as permissible by law;  
12 Q.  Ordering the defendant to pay court costs or reasonable attorney's fees;  
13 R.  Ordering the plaintiff to pay court costs or reasonable attorney's fees, or both, only

19 described in Title 17-A, section 852 or 853, respectively, entering any other orders 
20 determined necessary or appropriate in the discretion of the court, including, but not 
21 limited to, requiring the defendant to pay economic damages related to the return or 
22 restoration of the plaintiff's passport or other immigration document and any debts of 
23 the plaintiff arising from the trafficking relationship; or
24 U.  Entering any other orders determined necessary or appropriate in the discretion of 
25 the court.  
264.  No possession of firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, bow or crossbow or 
27dangerous weapons for duration of final protection order.  If the court prohibits the 
28 defendant from possessing a dangerous weapon other than a firearm, muzzle-loading 
29 firearm, bow or crossbow, the court shall specify the type of weapon the defendant is 
30 prohibited from possessing.
31 If the court prohibits the defendant from possessing a firearm, muzzle-loading firearm, 
32 bow, crossbow or other dangerous weapon, the court shall direct the defendant to 
33 relinquish, within 24 hours after service of the final protection order on the defendant or 
34 such earlier time as the court specifies in the final protection order, all firearms, muzzle-
35 loading firearms, bows, crossbows and specified dangerous weapons in the possession of 
36 the defendant to a law enforcement officer or other individual for the duration of the final 
37 protection order.  If the weapons are relinquished to an individual other than a law 
38 enforcement officer, the defendant must file, within 24 hours after such relinquishment, 
39 with the court or local law enforcement agency designated in the final protection order a 
40 written statement that contains the name and address of the individual holding the weapons 
41 and a description of all weapons held by that individual.  The court may subsequently issue 
42 a search warrant authorizing a law enforcement officer to seize any firearms, muzzle-
43 loading firearms, bows, crossbows and other dangerous weapons at any location if there is 1
2
Page 13 - 130LR1600(01)44 probable cause to believe such firearms, muzzle-loading firearms, bows, crossbows or 
45 dangerous weapons have not been relinquished by the defendant.
35.  Final protection order.  This subsection applies to a final protection order issued 
4 under this chapter. 
5 A.  A final protection order issued under this chapter must be for a fixed period not to 
6 exceed 2 years, unless extended by the court pursuant to section 4111.
7 B.  An order issued under this chapter must indicate, in a clear and conspicuous manner, 
8 the potential consequences of violation of the order, as provided in section 4113 and 
9 Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraph D, if applicable.
10 C.  If the court enjoins the defendant under this section and the enjoined conduct 
11 constitutes harassment under Title 17-A, section 506-A, the court shall include in the 
12 order a warning in conformity with Title 17-A, section 506-A.
136.  Limitations.  In issuing an order under this chapter, the court may not: 
14 A.  Affect title to any real property;
15 B.  Require the execution of a bond by the plaintiff prior to issuance of an order of 
16 protection; or
17 C.  Issue a mutual order of protection or restraint.  As used in this chapter, "mutual 
18 order of protection or restraint" means an order that is granted to the defendant under 
19 this chapter or the inclusion of language in an order granted to a plaintiff in an action 
20 under this chapter that restricts or limits the plaintiff's conduct with regard to the 
21 defendant absent the filing of a separate complaint by the defendant, service of the 
22 summons and complaint on the plaintiff and a finding by the court that the plaintiff 
23 committed the abuse alleged in the complaint.
24§4111.  Modifying and extending orders
251.  Extension.  The court may extend a final protection order issued under this chapter 
26 at the time of expiration, upon motion of the plaintiff, for such additional time as the court 
27 determines necessary to protect the plaintiff or minor child from abuse or conduct specified 
28 in section 4103.  A final protection order may be extended more than once and without 
29 limitation on the duration of the extension.  In determining whether extension of a final 
30 protection order is necessary, the court may consider:
31 A.  The underlying reasons for the order, including earlier abuse and the history of 
32 abuse;
33 B.  Conduct that has occurred since the entry of the final protection order; 
34 C.  The continued effect of any abuse on the plaintiff; and
35 D.  All other relevant factors pursuant to the discretion of the court. 
36 The court may continue the final protection order in effect until a hearing under section 
37 4109, subsection 1 on the motion to extend.  
382.  Modification of order.  Upon motion by either party, for sufficient cause, the court 
39 may modify an order issued under this chapter from time to time as circumstances require.
403.  Action by plaintiff.  A plaintiff may extinguish or modify an order issued under 
41 this chapter only by legal process in accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.  1
2
Page 14 - 130LR1600(01)42 Any other action or inaction on the part of the plaintiff does not alter, diminish or negate 
43 the effectiveness of the order.  Criminal sanctions may not be imposed upon the plaintiff 
44 for violation of a provision of the plaintiff's order for protection.
4§4112.  Sealing
51.  Identifying information.  If a party alleges in an affidavit or a pleading under oath 
6 that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of 
7 identifying information, the information must be sealed by the clerk of the court and not 
8 disclosed to the other party or to the public, unless the court orders the disclosure to be 
9 made after a hearing in which the court takes into consideration the health, safety or liberty 
10 of the party or child and determines that the disclosure is in the interest of justice.
112.  Private images.  In any proceeding under this chapter, access to and dissemination 
12 of certain private images as described in Title 17-A, section 511-A, and any written 
13 information describing and directly pertaining to the images contained in court records are 
14 governed by rule or administrative order adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court.
15§4113.  Violation
161.  Crime committed.  Except as provided in subsections 2, 4 and 5, violation of an 
17 order is a Class D crime when the defendant has prior actual notice, which may be notice 
18 by means other than service in hand, of the order.
192.  Exception.  When the only provision of the order that is violated concerns relief 
20 authorized under section 4110, subsection 3, paragraphs K to U, the violation must be 
21 treated as contempt and punished in accordance with law.
223.  Warrantless arrest.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an arrest 
23 for criminal violation of an order may be without warrant upon probable cause whether or 
24 not the violation is committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer. The law 
25 enforcement officer may verify, if necessary, the existence of the order, including by 
26 telephone or radio communication with a law enforcement agency with knowledge of the 
27 order.
284.  Reckless conduct; assault.  A defendant who violates a final protection order issued 
29 pursuant to section 4110 through conduct that is reckless and that creates a substantial risk 
30 of death or serious bodily injury to the plaintiff named in the final protection order or who 
31 assaults the plaintiff named in the final protection order commits a Class C crime.
325.  Repeat violations.  A person who commits a violation under subsection 1 or an 
33 order that is similar to a protective order pursuant to section 4110 issued by a court of the 
34 United States or of another state, territory, commonwealth or federally recognized Indian 
35 tribe and has 2 or more prior convictions under subsection 1 or 2 or more convictions for 
36 engaging in substantially similar conduct in another jurisdiction commits a Class C crime.  
37 Title 17-A, section 9-A governs the use of prior convictions when determining a sentence.
38§4114.  Law enforcement agency responsibilities
391.  Reports.  A law enforcement agency shall report all incidents of abuse by adults of 
40 family or household members as required by the State Bureau of Identification under Title 
41 25, section 1544.

43 ensure that dispatchers and officers at the scene of an alleged incident of abuse or violation 1
2
3
Page 15 - 130LR1600(01)44 of an order are informed of any recorded prior incident of abuse involving the abused party 
45 and can verify the effective dates and terms of a recorded order.
33.  Officer training.  A law enforcement agency shall provide officers employed by 
4 the agency an education and training program designed to inform the officers of the 
5 problems of family and household abuse, procedures to deal with these problems, the 
6 provisions of this chapter and the services and facilities available to abused family and 
7 household members.  The amount and degree of officer training, beyond the distribution of 
8 information, must be determined by each local law enforcement agency.
94.  Maine Criminal Code enforcement.  A law enforcement officer at the scene of an 
10 alleged incident of abuse shall use the same standard of enforcing relevant Maine Criminal 
11 Code sections when the incident involves family or household members as when it involves 
12 strangers.
135.  Arrest in certain situations.  A law enforcement officer shall arrest and take into 
14 custody the alleged offender when the law enforcement officer has probable cause to 
15 believe that: 
16 A.  There has been a criminal violation under section 4113 of an order issued under 
17 this chapter; 
18 B.  There has been a violation of an order issued under Title 15, chapter 12-A; or 
19 C.  There has been a violation of Title 17-A, section 208-D, 208-E or 208-F. 
206.  Officer responsibilities.  When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that 
21 a family or household member has been abused, the officer shall immediately use all 
22 reasonable means to prevent further abuse, including:
23 A.  Remaining on the scene as long as the officer reasonably believes there is a danger 
24 to the physical safety of that person without the presence of a law enforcement officer, 
25 including, but not limited to, staying in the dwelling unit;  
26 B.  Assisting that person in obtaining medical treatment necessitated by an assault, 
27 including driving the victim to the emergency room of the nearest hospital;
28 C.  Giving that person immediate and adequate written notice of that person's rights, 
29 which include information summarizing the procedures and relief available to victims 
30 of the family or household abuse;  
31 D.  Arresting the abusing party with or without a warrant pursuant to section 4113 and 
32 Title 17-A, section 15; and
33 E.  Making a good faith effort to administer a validated, evidence-based domestic 
34 violence risk assessment recommended by the Maine Commission on Domestic and 
35 Sexual Abuse, established in Title 5, section 12004-I, subsection 74-C, and approved 
36 by the Department of Public Safety.  The law enforcement officer administering this 
37 assessment shall provide the results of the assessment to the bail commissioner, if 
38 appropriate, and the district attorney for the county in which the abuse took place.
397.  Law enforcement agency policy.  Every law enforcement agency with the duty to 
40 investigate, prosecute and arrest offenders of this chapter and Title 17-A shall adopt a 
41 written policy on the enforcement of this chapter and the handling of domestic abuse cases 
42 in general.1
2
Page 16 - 130LR1600(01)18.  Prosecutorial policy.  The Attorney General, in consultation with a statewide 
2 association of prosecutors, shall develop a written policy regarding prosecution of domestic 
3 abuse cases under the provisions of Title 17-A.  The district attorney for each of the several 
4 counties within the State shall adopt a written policy regarding prosecution of domestic 
5 abuse cases.
69.  Notification of attempted purchase of firearm.  When the Department of Public 
7 Safety receives notification from a federal agency that a criminal background check 
8 conducted under the system established pursuant to 18 United States Code, Section 922(t) 
9 indicates that a potential buyer or transferee is prohibited from receipt or possession of a 
10 firearm pursuant to a temporary or final protection from abuse order, the department shall 
11 make every reasonable effort to notify as quickly as practicable both the individual intended 
12 to be protected by the protection from abuse order and another law enforcement agency 
13 with jurisdiction in the municipality in which that individual resides of the information 
14 received from the federal agency.
15 For the purposes of this subsection, notification may be made by the Department of Public 
16 Safety to the individual intended to be protected by the protection from abuse order through 
17 a law enforcement agency within the county in which the individual resides.  When the 
18 department makes notification through such a law enforcement agency, that agency then 
19 must make reasonable effort to notify as quickly as practicable the individual intended to 
20 be protected by the protection from abuse order.  If, when notifying a law enforcement 
21 agency, the department is informed by that agency that it cannot notify the individual 
22 intended to be protected by the protection from abuse order, the department must continue 
23 to make a reasonable effort to notify that individual as quickly as practicable, including 
24 through a different law enforcement agency within the county in which the individual 
25 resides.
2610.  Liability for damages.  The State, a political subdivision of the State or a law 
27 enforcement officer is not liable for damage that may be caused by the failure or inability 
28 to inform an individual who is the subject of a protection from abuse order in accordance 
29 with subsection 9.  This subsection does not prohibit the State or a political subdivision of 
30 the State from pursuing legally authorized disciplinary action.
3111.  Service of protection from abuse order.  Every law enforcement agency shall 
32 adopt a written policy on the service of protection from abuse orders that directs that every 
33 order issued under this chapter is served on the subject of the order as quickly as possible.  
34 Service of a protection from abuse order that is not in compliance with a policy adopted 
35 under this subsection does not affect the validity of the service or the order.

28SUMMARY
29 This bill clarifies and recodifies Maine's protection from abuse statutes to make the
