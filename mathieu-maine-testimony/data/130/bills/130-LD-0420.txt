Page 1 - 130LR1538(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  33 MRSA §2066, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 498, §22, is amended 
3 to read:
43.  No period of limitation, limited charges or fees; exceptions, disclosure.  
5 Notwithstanding section 2112, fees, charges or a period of limitation may not be imposed 
6 on stored-value obligations, except that the issuer may charge a transaction fee for the 
7 initial issuance and for each occurrence of adding value to an existing stored-value 
8 obligation.  These fees must be disclosed in a separate writing prior to the initial issuance 
9 or referenced on the stored-value obligation.  Fee restrictions do not apply to any stored-
10 value obligation that enables the holder to transfer the underlying funds to multiple 
11 unaffiliated merchants at the merchants' point-of-sale terminals or online or at an automated 
12 teller machine.
13Sec. 2.  33 MRSA §2070, sub-§2, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 498, §22, is

16 apparent owner, including an automatic withdrawal previously authorized or but not 
17 including an automatic reinvestment of dividends or interest  or an automatic 
18 withdrawal of disclosed fees;
19SUMMARY
20 This bill amends the Maine Revised Unclaimed Property Act in the following ways.
21 1.  It provides that fee restrictions do not apply to any stored-value obligation that 
22 enables the holder to transfer the underlying funds to multiple unaffiliated merchants at the 
23 merchants' point-of-sale terminals or online or at an automated teller machine.
24 2.  It provides that an automatic reinvestment of dividends or interest or an automatic 
25 withdrawal of disclosed fees is not an indication of an apparent owner's interest in property 
26 for purposes of determining when property is presumed abandoned.
