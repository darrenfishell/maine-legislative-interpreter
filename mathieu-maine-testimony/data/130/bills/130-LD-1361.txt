3 Maine Insurance Code by clarifying that telehealth is the provision through electronic 
4 means of health care services from a telehealth provider in one location and an enrollee in 
5 another location directly or through another health care provider, by clarifying which 
6 electronic means are allowed for providing telehealth and by removing the exclusion of 
7 audio-only telephone, facsimile machine, e-mail or texting from the definition.  The bill 
8 also repeals the provisions requiring the registration of out-of-state physicians providing 
9 telehealth consulting services and replacing the provisions with only the requirement that 
10 the out-of-state physician possess an unrestricted license in medicine in the state from 
11 which the physician is located when providing the consulting services and adds a similar 
12 provision in the provisions regarding licensure of osteopathic physicians.2
