Page 1 - 130LR1994(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the sole purpose of the Board of Dental Practice is to protect the public 
4 health and welfare by ensuring that the public is served by competent and honest 
5 practitioners and by establishing minimum standards of proficiency; and
6Whereas, the sole reliance on the accreditation status provided by the American 
7 Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation to doctoral degree programs in 
8 dentistry and dental hygiene degree programs has created unnecessary barriers for 
9 otherwise qualified applicants to obtain licensure in dentistry and dental hygiene; and
10Whereas, the sole reliance on licensure in good standing from another state or 
11 Canadian province has created unnecessary barriers for otherwise qualified applicants from 
12 other jurisdictions to obtain licensure under the Dental Practice Act; and
13Whereas, immediate enactment of this legislation is necessary to give the Board of 
14 Dental Practice statutory authority to consider on a case-by-case basis an applicant's 
15 educational equivalency in meeting the educational qualifications for licensure and to 
16 consider on a case-by-case basis an applicant's licensure in good standing from another 
17 jurisdiction; and
18Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
19 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
20 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
