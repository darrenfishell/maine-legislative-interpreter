19SUMMARY
20 This resolve directs the Department of Economic and Community Development to 
21 coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the Governor's Office of Policy 
22 Innovation and the Future to conduct a feasibility study of the costs and benefits of 
23 completing a paved multi-use trail on the approximately 28 miles of state-owned railroad 
24 track on the Mountain Division Line connecting the Town of Standish and the Town of 
25 Fryeburg.  The 28-mile section for review is between 2 sections of trail along the Mountain 
26 Division Line that have already been constructed by the Department of Transportation and 
27 are in use:  a 4-mile paved rail trail in Fryeburg and a 5-mile paved rail trail in Gorham and 
28 Windham.  The feasibility study will assess the development of a paved multi-use trail as 
29 an alternative transportation corridor connecting the communities of Windham, Gorham, 
30 Standish, Baldwin, Hiram, Brownfield and Fryeburg and the New Hampshire border.  The 
31 Department of Economic and Community Development is required to submit a report that 
32 includes a recommended development plan for completing a paved multi-use trail by 
33 December 31, 2021 for presentation to the Second Regular Session of the 130th
