2 This bill clarifies the Maine Food Sovereignty Act.  The bill amends the definition of 
3 "direct producer-to-consumer transaction" to mean any exchange of food or food products 
4 directly between a producer and a consumer in a manner mutually agreed upon by the 
5 producer and consumer of the food or food products rather than face-to-face transactions 
6 at the site of production.  The bill also provides that counties have the same authority as 
7 municipalities to adopt direct producer-to-consumer ordinances under the Maine Food
