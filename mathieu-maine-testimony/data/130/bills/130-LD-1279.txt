Page 1 - 130LR1398(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 
5 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the 
6 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 
7 wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00 
8 per hour; starting January 1, 2022, the minimum hourly wage is $13.00 per hour; starting 
9 January 1, 2023, the minimum hourly wage is $14.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2024, 
10 the minimum hourly wage is $15.00 per hour; and, starting January 1, 2025, the minimum 
11 hourly wage is $16.00 per hour.  On January 1, 2021 2026 and each January 1st thereafter, 
12 the minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the 
13 cost of living. The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage 
14 increase, if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year 
15 preceding that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical 
16 Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the 
17 United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with 
18 the amount of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  If the 
19 highest federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under 
20 this section, the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same amount, 
21 effective on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be 
22 increased in accordance with this section thereafter.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill increases the minimum hourly wage, starting January 1, 2022, from its present 
25 $12.00 per hour to $13.00 per hour and by an additional $1.00 per hour each year until the 
26 minimum wage on January 1, 2025 is $16.00 per hour.  Beginning January 1, 2026 and 
27 every year after, the minimum wage increases by the increase, if any, in the cost of living.24
