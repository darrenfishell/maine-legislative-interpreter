Page 1 - 130LR2437(01)1Preamble.  Whereas, genome-editing technologies, such as clustered regularly 
2 interspaced short palindromic repeats, also known as CRISPR, CRISPR-associated protein 
3 9, also known as Cas9, and gene drive, have been discovered and dramatically refined in 
4 recent years, enabling innumerable opportunities around the world to inexpensively edit 
5 the genetic code of any living thing; and
6Whereas, many deadly human diseases could be eradicated with genome-editing 
7 technology, thereby saving countless lives, immeasurable heartache and large health care 
8 expenditures in perpetuity; and
9Whereas, a genetic alteration in a species of marine, terrestrial or airborne animal, 
10 plant, fungus, protozoan, bacteria or virus could rapidly alter the natural beauty, ecology, 
11 security and economy of Maine; and
12Whereas, Maine's higher education system and technology sector can further position 
13 themselves as leaders in innovation and ethical implementation, reaping enduring benefits 
14 for Maine citizens, through the use of these technologies; and
15Whereas, there are significant ethical, social and legal considerations for genome 
16 editing in humans and other species; and
17Whereas, in the past, scientific ideas have been used in the implementation of and to 
18 promote eugenics programs and other forms of oppression; and
19Whereas, throughout history living organisms have been used as weapons, and 
20 genome-editing technologies create new security needs in the endless effort to protect the 
21 people of Maine and the United States; and
22Whereas, genome editing has the potential to fundamentally improve or diminish our 
23 health, our natural environment, our social fabric and our economy; and
24Whereas, the pace of innovation is accelerating and over the next several years Maine 
25 can capitalize on the changes in our world that genome editing can bring about or risk being 
26 left behind; now, therefore, be it
27Sec. 1.  Panel established.  Resolved:  That the Advisory Panel To Better
