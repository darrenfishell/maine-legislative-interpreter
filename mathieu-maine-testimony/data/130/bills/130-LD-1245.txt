3Whereas, firefighters must remain ever vigilant as fires and other emergencies happen 
4 every day; and
5Whereas, firefighters are exposed to toxic fumes and substances regularly in the 
6 course of their firefighting duties; and

9 protect them in their firefighting duties; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
