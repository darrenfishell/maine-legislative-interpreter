Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Increase in the incidence of class C crimes; increases correctional and judicial costs. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new felony cases filed in the court system does not 
require additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fines may increase General Fund and other dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill modifies an existing class C crime of violating a protective order to include instances when the protective 
order was not issued by a Maine court. It is unclear how many additional individuals will be convicted of a Class C 
crime who otherwise would not have been. The current average cost of incarcerating an individual for a single year is 
$55,203. The Department of Corrections has not indicated the need for additional funding at this time and no funding 
is included in the bill.
