2Sec. 1.  13-B MRSA §602, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1977, c. 525, §13, is amended 
3 to read:
41.  Where held; remote participation.  Meetings of members, if any, may be held at 
5 such place, either within or without this State, as may be provided in the bylaws. In the 
6 absence of any such provision, all meetings shall must be held at the registered office of 
7 the corporation in this State or, in the sole discretion of the board of directors, a meeting 
8 may be held entirely through means of remote communication without a specific site for 
9 the meeting.   The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, adopt guidelines and 
10 procedures authorizing members who are not physically present at a meeting of members 
11 to, by means of remote communication:
12 A.  Participate in a meeting of members; and
13 B.  Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of members, whether such 
14 meeting is to be held at a designated place or entirely through means of remote 
15 communication, only if:
16 (1)  The corporation has implemented reasonable measures to verify each person 
17 participating remotely is a member or proxy holder of a member;
18 (2)  The corporation has implemented reasonable measures to provide the members 
19 or their proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to 
20 vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to 
21 communicate and to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting, substantially 
22 concurrently with the proceedings; and
23 (3)  If any member or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by 
24 means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action is 
25 maintained by the corporation.

29 or the board of directors or members may determine, that some or all votes by members, as 
30 well as actions taken in accordance with section 606, may be conducted by electronic 
31 transmission under procedures established by the corporation.  If the board of directors 
32 adopts guidelines and procedures under section 602, subsection 1 authorizing members to 
33 vote by means of remote communication, votes may be conducted remotely.  A vote 
34 conducted by electronic transmission or remotely must be filed with the minutes of 
35 members' meetings and has the same effect as an in-person vote or a vote by proxy.
