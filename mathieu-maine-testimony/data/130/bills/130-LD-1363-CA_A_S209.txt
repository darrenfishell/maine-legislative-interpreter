B. The voter may cure the defect by telephone by self-identifying by name, date of 
birth and residence address and confirming that the voter requested an absentee ballot 
and the voter or the voter's aide under section 754-A, subsection 3 placed the absentee

before the deadline for returning absentee ballots under section 755, the clerk shall 
accept the ballot but challenge it pursuant to section 673, subsection 1. 
C. If the voter does not cure the defect under the procedures in paragraph A or B before

32 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" /J." to S.P. 450, L.D. 1363 ( S~ t 01) 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes the following 
changes to the bill. 
1. It clarifies that the requirement that the Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau 
of Motor Vehicles scan documentation when creating a pending voter registration record 
· for an individual who has not opted out of automatic voter registration applies only to 
documentation that provides proof of voter eligibility. It also delays from January 1, 2022 
to June 1, 2022 the date upon which the bureau is required to conduct automatic voter 
registration. 
2. It strikes the provision of the bill that changes the requirements for a political party 
to retain its qualification. 
3. It reorganizes and streamlines the provisions of the bill that establish the 
requirements for secured drop boxes for absentee ballots and the process by which a voter 
may cure a defect on the return envelope for an absentee ballot. It also clarifies that, when 
a voter cures a defect on the return envelope, the municipal clerk must update the voter 
registration system to list the date that the defect was cured as the date that the absentee 
ballot was received. 
4. It clarifies that a written request for an absentee ballot must include the voter's date • 
of birth and an electronic application for an absentee ballot must include the voter's name, 
date of birth, residence address or other address sufficient to identify the voter and, if 
appl-icable, a different address to which the voter requests the ballot be sent or delivered. 
5. It clarifies that, as in current law, an absentee ballot must be rejected if the voter is 
not registered to vot~ or, when necessary to vote in a primary election, when the voter is 
not enrolled in the relevant political party. 
6. It requires the Secretary of State to establish and maintain an online service that 
allows an absentee voter to track the status of the absentee ballot process. 
7. It provides that, when certifying the results of the general election for United States 
President in the State, the Governor must report the number of votes that each candidate 
for President received statewide and for each congressional district in the final round of 
ranked-choice voting tabulation.
