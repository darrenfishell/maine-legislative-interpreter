20§2017.  Legislative intent regarding restrictions on undetectable or untraceable

22 The Legislature finds that undetectable and untraceable firearms are a danger to the 
23 residents of this State.  The Legislature finds that the restrictions imposed on undetectable 
24 firearms pursuant to section 2015, on untraceable firearms pursuant to section 2016 and on 
25 the dissemination of downloadable gun code pursuant to section 2016 are necessary to 
26 ensure that undetectable and untraceable firearms, as defined in sections 2015 and 2016, 
27 respectively, are clearly prohibited in the State, except as specifically provided.  The 
28 Legislature further finds that these restrictions are necessary to discourage and prevent the 
29 dissemination of firearms that are undetectable in metal detectors and other security 
30 screening devices, that are untraceable due to the lack of a serial number or other form of 
31 required firearm identification and that can readily be possessed by those who may not be 
32 legally able to do so under existing federal and state laws.  The Legislature finds that the 
33 restrictions imposed pursuant to sections 2015 and 2016 are necessary to prevent the 
34 widespread possession of these dangerous weapons before they become a prevalent 
35 problem in this State and a threat to the health and well-being of the residents of this State.
36SUMMARY
37 This bill regulates the manufacture, distribution and possession of undetectable and 
38 untraceable firearms.  The bill provides definitions of "undetectable firearm" and 
39 "untraceable firearm" and prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, transfer and possession 
40 of such firearms with certain exceptions.  The bill also prohibits, with certain exceptions, 
41 the dissemination of downloadable gun code from which untraceable firearms can be 
42 manufactured.37
