SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill and makes the following changes to the campaign finance laws. 
L It defines "business entity," for purposes of the amendment, as a firm, partnership, 
corporation, incorporated association, labor organization or other organization, whether 
organized as a for-profit or a nonprofit entity. 
2. It employs the phrase "separate segregated fund committee" to describe a political 
action committee that is a separate or segregated fund established by any corporation, 
membership organization, cooperative or labor or other organization whose purpose is to 
initiate or influence a campaign. A separate segregated fund committee may not accept 
contributions from an individual aggregating more than $5,000 in a calendar year. A 
separate segregated fund committee also may not accept any contributions from a business 
entity, except that the corporation or organization that established the separate segregated 
fund committee may provide the use of offices, telephones, computers and similar 
equipment when that use does not result in additional cost to the corporation or 
organization. 
3. It defines a "leadership political action committee" as a political action committee, 
other than a caucus political action committee, that was directly or indirectly established 
by a current member of the Legislature or that is directly or indirectly maintained or 
controlled by a current member of the Legislature. A business entity may not make any 
contributions to a leadership political action committee. A party committee, a leadership 
political action committee, a separate segregated fund committee, a caucus political action 
committee and any other political action committee may make contributions to a leadership 
political action committee aggregating no more in a calendar year than the amount that the 
committee may contribute to a legislative candidate in any one election, except that the 
committee may not make any monetary contributions to a leadership political action 
committee using funds that derive, in whole or in part, from a business entity. 
4. It prohibits a business entity from making contributions to candidates. A party 
committee, a leadership political action committee, a separate segregated fund committee, 
a caucus political action committee and any other political action committee may make 
contributions to candidates that do not exceed the contribution limits applicable to 
individuals but may not make monetary contributions to candidates using funds that derive, 
in whole or in part, from a business entity.
