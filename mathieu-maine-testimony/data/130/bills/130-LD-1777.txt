Page 1 - 130LR2385(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง3802, sub-ยง13, as amended by PL 2019, c. 219, ยง3, is 
3 repealed and the following enacted in its place:
413.  Withdrawal from education service center.  Notwithstanding a withdrawal 
5 provision in an interlocal agreement establishing an education service center, withdrawal 
6 of a member school administrative unit from an education service center is governed 
7 exclusively by this subsection.  A member school administrative unit may withdraw from 
8 an education service center at any time by providing written notice of withdrawal not less 
9 than one year before the date of withdrawal to each of the other member school 
10 administrative units participating in the education service center.  The date of withdrawal 
11 must be the end of the member school administrative unit's fiscal year.  After the member 
12 school administrative units have received the notice of withdrawal, the parties must enter 
13 into a withdrawal agreement to be approved by the school board of each of the parties.  If 
14 the parties are unable to agree on a withdrawal agreement before the date of withdrawal, 
15 any party may submit an area of disagreement to a neutral arbitrator. The parties must agree 
16 on the selection of the arbitrator. If the parties are unable to enter into a withdrawal 
17 agreement before the end of the 15th day after the date of withdrawal, an arbitrator must 
18 be selected according to the procedure of a nationwide, not-for-profit organization that 
19 provides arbitration and alternative dispute resolution services. The decision of the 
20 arbitrator selected under that procedure is final. For the purposes of this subsection, 
21 "parties" means the withdrawing member school administrative unit and the remaining 
22 member school administrative units.
23SUMMARY
24 This bill amends the laws relating to the withdrawal of a school administrative unit 
25 from an education service center.24
