that: 
1. If conducted by licensed commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities licensed on

recognized Indian tribes in the State, mobile sports wagering will serve as an effective 
economic development tool for tribal governments and tribal members and provide 
economic stimulus to the State; 
2. Authorizing the federally recognized Indian tribes in the State, in addition to the 
licensed commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities licensed on or before January 1, 
2021 and licensed slot machine facilities and casinos, to conduct mobile sports wagering is 
fair and equitable because those Indian tribes previously have been excluded from 
conducting most forms of gaming in the State; 
3. If conducted by licensed commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities licensed on 
or before January 1, 2021, licensed slot machine ,facilities and casinos and federally
