3 amended to read:
41.  Credit allowed.  A taxpayer is allowed a credit against the tax due under this Part 
5 equal to the sum of 5% 10% of the excess, if any, of the qualified research expenses for the 
6 taxable year over the base amount and 7.5% 15% of the basic research payments 
7 determined under the Code, Section 41(e)(1)(A).  The term "base amount" means the 
8 average amount per year spent on qualified research expenses over the previous 3 taxable 
9 years by the taxpayer.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
10 terms "qualified research expenses," "qualified organization base period amount," "basic 
11 research" and any other terms affecting the calculation of the credit have the same meanings 
12 as under the Code, Section 41, but apply only to expenditures for research conducted in 
13 this State.  In determining the amount of the credit allowable under this section, the State 
14 Tax Assessor may aggregate the activities of all corporations that are members of a 
15 controlled group of corporations, as defined by the Code, Section 41(f)(1)(A) and in 
16 addition may aggregate the activities of all entities, whether or not incorporated, that are 
17 under common control, as defined by the Code, Section 41(f)(1)(B).

21 100% of a corporation's first $25,000 $50,000 of tax due, as determined before the 
22 allowance of any credits, plus 75% of the corporation's tax due, as determined in excess of 
23 $25,000 $50,000.  The assessor shall adopt rules similar to those authorized under the Code,
