A. The type, intensity, duration or quantity of services provided; or 
B. The characteristics of the population receiving a service that affect the cost of the 
service. 
An adjustment under this subsection must reflect costs incurred retroactive to the date that 
the department received the federally qualified health center request for the adjustment, 
unless the department determines that the change in scope was due to conditions or events 
that were beyond the control of the federally qualified health center, in which case the 
adjustment must be retroactive to the more recent of the date that the federally qualified 
health center incurred the cost increases requiring an adjustment and the date that is one 
year prior to the date the department received the federally qualified health center change 
in scope request.

payment model developed by the department for payments to federally qualified health 
centers. 
A. The alternative payment model must be consistent with the requirements of 42

B. As long as federal law continues to require that the department allow a federally 
qualified health center to elect to use the prospective payment system set forth in 42 
United States Code, Section 1396a(bb)(3), the alternative payment model developed 
under this subsection must be an additional option and not a replacement of the updated 
base year option provided in subsection 3. 
C. In developing the alternative payment model, the department shall consult with 
federally qualified health centers and provide a reasonable opportunity for dialogue 
and exchange of data before any rule implementing such a model is proposed.
