35 to any credit taken by a certified applicant under this chapter, and that person is credited 
36 with having paid that amount of tax for the taxable year beginning in the calendar year 
37 without regard to any credit taken by a certified applicant under this chapter. If more than

39 for the most recent taxable year.
