Page 1 - 130LR1236(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §3253-A, sub-§3, as repealed and replaced by PL 2007, c. 
3 424, §2, is amended to read:
43.  Tuition.  Notwithstanding section 5805, subsection 2 and section 5809, the 
5 commissioner shall pay tuition for each tuition student in an amount equal to the official 
6 tuition rate approved pursuant to section 5805, subsection 1 for the receiving school for 
7 nonresident students enrolled in secondary schools or special education or career and 
8 technical education programs as long as the student maintains a satisfactory standard of 
9 deportment and scholarship.  The commissioner shall pay tuition for each tuition student 
10 in an amount equal to the official tuition rate approved pursuant to section 7302 for the 
11 receiving school for nonresident students enrolled in special education programs, as long 
12 as the student maintains a satisfactory standard of deportment and scholarship.

14SUMMARY
15 Under current law, a school that receives tuition students who are enrolled in regular 
16 school day career and technical educational programs at career and technical education 
17 centers, satellites or career and technical education regions may only charge a tuition rate 
18 of up to 2/3 of the maximum tuition rate.  Public schools do not have this limitation and 
19 are not limited to 2/3 of the funding for a student who enrolls in such a program.  This bill 
20 repeals this limitation on schools that receive tuition students to create parity with public 
21 schools.
