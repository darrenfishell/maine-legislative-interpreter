Page 1 - 130LR0834(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, due to the pandemic related to the novel coronavirus disease, the 
4 Department of Environmental Protection has delayed until July 1, 2021 the enforcement of 
5 the law prohibiting the processing, preparation, sale or provision of food or beverages by 
6 certain establishments in or on a polystyrene foam disposable food service container, which 
7 was set to take effect on January 1, 2021; and
8Whereas, that law exempts from its prohibition the retail sale of food or beverages 
9 that certain establishments purchase prepackaged at wholesale in or on a polystyrene foam 
10 disposable food service container; and
11Whereas, that exemption has been interpreted to allow meat, poultry, fish, seafood 
12 and eggs from out-of-state producers, but not Maine-based producers, to be sold at retail in 
13 Maine when purchased prepackaged at wholesale in or on a polystyrene foam disposable 
14 food service container; and
15Whereas, to ensure fairness in the treatment of both out-of-state and Maine-based 
16 meat, poultry, fish, seafood and egg producers under that law prior to its anticipated 
17 enforcement beginning July 1, 2021, immediate enactment of this legislation is necessary; 
18 and
19Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
20 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
21 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
22 therefore,
23Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
24Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §1571, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 62, §1, is amended to

32 ice chests that are used for the processing or shipping of seafood or service ware used 
33 to contain, transport or otherwise package raw, uncooked or butchered meat, poultry, 
34 fish, seafood or eggs.
35Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §1571, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 62, §1, is amended to

Page 2 - 130LR0834(01)1SUMMARY
2 Current law prohibits the processing, preparation, sale or provision of food or 
3 beverages by certain establishments in or on a polystyrene foam disposable food service 
4 container.  This bill, which is emergency legislation, amends the definition of "disposable 
5 food service container" under that law to exclude service ware used to contain, transport or 
6 otherwise package raw, uncooked or butchered meat, poultry, fish, seafood or eggs.  It also 
7 clarifies the meaning of "service ware" as used under that law.2
