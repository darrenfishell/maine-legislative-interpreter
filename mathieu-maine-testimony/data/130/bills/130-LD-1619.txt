DAREK M.  GRANT
Secretary of the Senate
Presented by Senator LAWRENCE  of York.   (GOVERNOR'S BILL)

Page 1 - 130LR2053(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, development of offshore wind power projects, particularly those which 
4 deploy deep-water, floating platform technology, in suitable locations off Maine's coast 
5 may provide significant economic and environmental benefits to the State by generating 
6 renewable energy needed to achieve the goals and objectives of the State's climate action 
7 plan adopted pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 577 and related state 
8 economic and environmental goals and objectives developed by the Maine Climate Council 
9 pursuant to Title 38, section 577-A; and
10Whereas, the siting, construction and operation of offshore wind power projects in 
11 Maine's territorial waters, as defined by Title 12, section 6001, subsection 48-B, may 
12 adversely affect resources, including scenic and aesthetic resources, and recreational and 
13 economic uses, including commercial fishing, which are more commonly found or take 
14 place in the State's submerged lands and territorial waters than in proximate federal waters; 
15 and
16Whereas, Maine's renewable, natural resources-based commercial fishing industry 
17 contributed direct revenues of $517 million to the State's economy in 2020 and is a vital 
18 part of the State's economy and cultural heritage and identity; and
19Whereas, Maine's lobster fishery is active primarily in Maine's territorial waters, had 
20 landings valued in excess of $405 million in 2020, had an additional statewide economic 
21 impact of $1 billion and is among the most valuable fisheries in the United States; and
22Whereas, there are outstanding questions regarding the manner in and extent to which 
23 the siting, construction and operation of offshore wind power projects may displace or 
24 otherwise adversely affect natural resources within and uses of the State's submerged lands 
25 and territorial waters; and
26Whereas, it is anticipated that the growth and development of the offshore wind 
27 power industry in the Northeast region and elsewhere in the United States over the next 
28 decade will provide additional information through project-specific studies, research 
29 findings, monitoring results and operational experience that may assist the State in 
30 evaluating the siting and development of new offshore wind power projects in the State's 
31 submerged lands and territorial waters; and
32Whereas, a moratorium on the development of offshore wind power projects will 
33 allow the State to undergo a review of applicable state laws and rules to determine whether 
34 the existing offshore wind power regulatory framework adequately protects Maine's coastal 
35 resources in a manner that avoids or minimizes adverse effects on coastal resources and 
36 uses; and
37Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
38 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
39 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
40 therefore,
41Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
42Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง3405 is enacted to read:
Page 2 - 130LR2053(01)1ยง3405.  Moratorium on offshore wind power projects in territorial waters and 
2submerged lands
31.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
4 following terms have the following meanings.
5 A.  "Offshore wind energy demonstration project" has the same meaning as in Title 38, 
6 section 480-HH, subsection 1, paragraph H.
7 B.  "Offshore wind power project" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 480-B, 
8 subsection 6-A.
9 C.  "Submerged lands" has the same meaning as in Title 12, section 1801, subsection 
10 9.
11 D.  "Territorial waters" has the same meaning as in Title 12, section 6001, subsection 
12 48-B.
132.  Moratorium.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and except as 
14 otherwise provided by subsection 3, from the effective date of this section to January 15, 
15 2031, a state agency or municipality or other political subdivision of the State may not 
16 license, permit or otherwise approve or authorize the siting, construction or operation of or 
17 issue a lease or grant an easement or other real property interest for a windmill or wind 
18 turbine or tower for an offshore wind power project in state-owned submerged lands or 
19 territorial waters.  Nothing in this subsection may be construed as limiting any regulatory 
20 approval of or the issuance of any lease or grant of any easement or other real property 
21 interest for utility cables, transmission lines or portside infrastructure that may support 
22 offshore wind energy generation.
233.  Exemption.  The moratorium established under subsection 2 does not apply to an 
24 offshore wind energy demonstration project that is proposed for location in the Maine 
25 Offshore Wind Energy Research Center designated by the Department of Agriculture, 
26 Conservation and Forestry pursuant to Title 12, section 1868 and for which, prior to the 
27 effective date of this section, the commission has approved the terms of a long-term power 
28 purchase agreement.  Subsequent amendment of the terms of such an agreement does not 
29 affect the applicability of this exemption.
30Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
31 takes effect when approved.
32SUMMARY
33 This bill establishes a moratorium that, until 2031, prohibits any state agency or 
34 municipality or other subdivision of the State from licensing, permitting or otherwise 
35 authorizing or approving the siting, construction or operation of a windmill or wind turbine 
36 or tower for an offshore wind power project in state-owned submerged lands or Maine's 
37 territorial waters.  The moratorium does not apply to cables, transmission lines and portside 
38 infrastructure that may support offshore wind energy generation and does not apply to an 
39 offshore wind energy demonstration project proposed for location in the Maine Offshore 
40 Wind Energy Research Center for which the Public Utilities Commission has approved the 
41 terms of a long-term power purchase agreement.33
