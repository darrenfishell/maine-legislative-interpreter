Page 1 - 130LR1859(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง3105, sub-ยง4 is enacted to read:
34.  Financing agreement.  A transmission and distribution utility may enter into a 
4 written agreement with a customer for the financing of the purchase price and installation 
5 costs of an efficient electric heat pump under this section.  The agreement may provide that 
6 the price and costs may be recovered by a finance charge on the monthly bill for the 
7 customer's electricity account and must plainly state any interest charged on the amount 
8 financed.  A failure to pay the finance charge may be treated as a failure to pay the 
9 electricity bill, and the transmission and distribution utility may disconnect that customer's 
10 service or seek any other remedy for nonpayment provided by section 704.  The finance 
11 charge must be shown on a separate line on the monthly bill.  The agreement may allow 
12 the transmission and distribution utility to assess the finance charge on a subsequent 
13 purchaser of the property on which the efficient electric heat pump is installed if at the time 
14 the agreement is entered into the utility files a notice of the agreement and finance charge 
15 in the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is located.  The agreement may 
16 allow the transmission and distribution utility to assess the finance charge on a subsequent 
17 renter of the unit rented by a customer who is a tenant if at the time the agreement is entered 
18 into the agreement is signed by the tenant's landlord or the owner of the property on which 
19 the heat pump is installed and the utility files a notice of the agreement and finance charge 
20 in the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is located.  Notice required to 
21 be filed under this subsection does not constitute a lien on the property.  The rate of any 
22 interest charged on financing under this subsection must be a fixed rate over the term of 
23 the agreement and may not exceed 4% above the stated yield for a one-year treasury bill as 
24 published by the Federal Reserve System at the time the agreement is entered into.  Any 
25 indebtedness created under this subsection may be paid in full at any time before it is due 
26 without penalty.
27SUMMARY
28 This bill allows a transmission and distribution utility to enter into a financing 
29 agreement with a customer for the purchase price and installation costs of an efficient 
30 electric heat pump and receive payment through subsequent charges on the customer's 
31 electric bill.  The agreement may provide for payment by a subsequent purchaser of the 
32 property on which the heat pump is located or by a subsequent renter of the tenant's unit if 
33 the tenant's landlord or the owner of the property signs the agreement.28
