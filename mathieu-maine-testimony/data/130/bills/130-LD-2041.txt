3SUMMARY
4 Current law allows the earned income tax credit to be refundable for resident taxpayers 
5 and part-year resident taxpayers.  The earned income tax credit was increased in the so-
6 called supplemental General Fund budget, Public Law 2021, chapter 635, but the cross-
7 reference to the provision of law regarding the refundability of the credit for residents was 
8 inadvertently omitted.  Part A, section 1 corrects a cross-reference to continue the 
9 refundability of the earned income tax credit for resident taxpayers.
10 Part OO of the so-called supplemental General Fund budget, Public Law 2021, chapter 
11 635, enacted a program to provide 2 years of enrollment for free at a Maine community 
12 college.  As enacted, the program allows a person who graduates from high school, or 
13 obtains the equivalent of a high school diploma, in 2020, 2021 or 2022 to attend community 
14 college for free if the person enrolls in a Maine community college in the fall of 2022 but 
15 not if the person enrolls in a Maine community college in the fall of 2023.  Part A, sections 
16 2 and 3 correct that error by specifying that a graduate, or equivalent, in the class of 2020, 
17 2021 or 2022 may also obtain free tuition by enrolling in a Maine community college in 
18 the fall of 2023.
19 Part B, section 1 corrects L.D. 533, An Act To Expand the Statewide Voluntary Early 
20 Childhood Consultation Program, which was amended off of the Special Appropriations 
21 Table to provide funding from the General Fund to the early childhood consultation 
22 program in the Department of Health and Human Services and offset that funding through 
23 a transfer from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund.  The transfer from the Liquor 
24 Operation Revenue Fund was inadvertently left off of the enacted bill.  Section 4 corrects 
25 that error by including the transfer language in Public Law 2021, chapter 679.
26 Part B, section 2 corrects L.D. 731, An Act To Establish a Program To Assist Regional 
27 Firefighter Training Programs, To Provide Tax Credits to Businesses That Employ 
28 Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services Persons and To Provide Benefits 
29 to Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services Persons, which was amended 
30 off of the Special Appropriations Table to move appropriations from fiscal year 2021-22 
31 to fiscal year 2022-23, including $200,000 in ongoing funding for the program established 
32 in the legislation to provide grants to municipalities for the purpose of funding regional fire 
33 service training of municipal firefighters and public safety employees and $33,000 in one-
34 time funding for computer programming changes necessary to accommodate the tax credit 
35 for employers of volunteer firefighters and volunteer municipal emergency services 
36 persons.  The bill, as enacted, left off the $200,000 appropriation for fiscal year 2022-23.  
37 Part B, section 2 amends Public Law 2021, chapter 731 to add the $200,000 appropriation.
38 Part B, section 3 corrects L.D. 910, An Act To Amend the General Assistance Laws 
39 Governing Reimbursement, which was amended off of the Special Appropriations Table 
40 to provide funding of $10,000,000 in fiscal year 2021-22 to the Department of Health and 
41 Human Services, General Assistance, Other Special Revenue Funds account from the 
42 General Fund and to offset those amounts through a transfer from the Liquor Operation 
43 Revenue Fund.  The amounts specified in the section of the enacted bill transferring funds 
44 from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund were incorrectly stated. Part B, section 3 amends 1
