13 transmission and distribution utility to the customer over a billing period and the kilowatt-
14 hours delivered by the customer to the transmission and distribution utility over the billing 
15 period, taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt-hour credits from the previous 
16 billing period.

23 C.  "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which a customer 
24 is billed on the basis of the difference between the kilowatt‑hours delivered by a 
25 transmission and distribution utility to the customer over a billing period and the

27 over the billing period, taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt‑hour credits

33 purchase agreement.
343.  Shared financial interest for investor-owned utility customers; limitation.

37 generation resource under subsection 2.  Any number of customers of an investor-owned 
38 transmission and distribution utility with a shared financial interest in a distributed 
39 generation resource may participate in net energy billing, except that the number of eligible

41 resource located in the service territory of an investor-owned transmission and distribution 
42 utility located in an area administered by the independent system administrator for northern

Page 2 - 130LR0706(01)44 the commission determines that the utility's billing system can accommodate more than 10 
45 accounts or meters for the purpose of net energy billing.

6 generation resource located in that municipality that may be used for the net energy billing 
7 may be 5 megawatts or more, as long as less than 5 megawatts of metered electricity from
