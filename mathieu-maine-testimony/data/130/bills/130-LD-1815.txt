19Sec. 11.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§8, ¶B-1, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
20 §18 and affected by §34, is amended to read:
21 B-1.  The controlling person with ultimate control of an insurer subject to registration 
22 shall also file an annual enterprise risk report .  The report must be appropriate to the 
23 nature, scale and complexity of the operations of the insurance holding company 
24 system and must, to the best of the controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify 
25 the material risks within the insurance holding company system, if any, that could pose 
26 enterprise risk to the insurer  in accordance with subparagraph (1) and, if applicable, 
27 shall file any additional reports required by this paragraph.  The  report reports must be 
28 filed with the lead state regulator of the insurance holding company system as 
29 determined by the procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the 
30 National Association of Insurance Commissioners;  NAIC Financial Analysis 
31 Handbook or successor publication.
32 (1)  The enterprise risk report must be appropriate to the nature, scale and 
33 complexity of the operations of the insurance holding company system and must, 
34 to the best of the controlling person’s knowledge and belief, identify the material 
35 risks within the insurance holding company system, if any, that could pose 
36 enterprise risk to the insurer.
37 (2)  Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the ultimate controlling 
38 person of an insurer subject to registration shall file an annual group capital 
39 calculation concurrently with the registration required by paragraph A. The report 
40 must be completed as directed by the lead state regulator in accordance with the 
41 group capital calculation instructions, which may permit the lead state regulator to 
42 allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the 
43 group capital calculation. 
Page 4 - 130LR2237(01)1 (a)  An insurance holding company is exempt from filing the group capital 
2 calculation if it has only one insurer within its holding company structure and 
3 that insurer is not licensed outside this State to transact insurance, does not 
4 write business outside this State and does not assume reinsurance from any 
5 other insurer.
6 (b)  An insurance holding company is exempt from filing the group capital 
7 calculation if it is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by 
8 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the lead state 
9 regulator has obtained the current group capital calculation from the board of 
10 governors. If this State is the insurance holding company system’s lead state, 
11 the superintendent shall request the calculation from the board of governors 
12 under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect.
13 (c)  An insurance holding company is exempt from filing the group capital 
14 calculation if its groupwide supervisor is located within a non-United States 
15 jurisdiction that the superintendent has designated as a reciprocal jurisdiction 
16 pursuant to section 731-B, subsection 1, paragraph B-3, subparagraph (1), 
17 division (b) and that recognizes the United States system of group supervision 
18 and group capital regulation.
19 (d)  An insurance holding company is exempt from filing the group capital 
20 calculation if its groupwide supervisor is located in a non-United States 
21 jurisdiction and:
22 (i)  The lead state regulator meets the requirements for accreditation under 
23 the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program and the insurance 
24 holding company system provides information to the lead state regulator, 
25 either directly or indirectly through the groupwide supervisor, that the lead 
26 state regulator has determined to be satisfactory to allow the lead state to 
27 comply with the NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the 
28 NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook or successor publication; and
29 (ii)  The groupwide supervisor recognizes and accepts the group capital 
30 calculation as the worldwide group capital assessment for United States 
31 insurance groups that operate in that non-United States jurisdiction, 
32 consistent with criteria specified by the superintendent by rule.
33 (e)  Notwithstanding divisions (c) and (d), a non-United States-based insurance 
34 holding company system shall file a group capital calculation limited to its 
35 United States operations if its lead state regulator determines, after any 
36 necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, that requiring a 
37 United States group capital calculation is appropriate for prudential oversight 
38 and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the 
39 insurance marketplace.
40 (f)  If this State is an insurance holding company system’s lead state, the 
41 superintendent may exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing an 
42 annual group capital calculation or may accept a limited group capital filing or 
43 report in accordance with criteria specified by the superintendent by rule. An 
44 exemption or modification granted under a substantially similar law of another 
45 jurisdiction that is the lead state of an insurance holding company system that 
Page 5 - 130LR2237(01)46 includes a domestic insurer applies to a filing otherwise required by this 
47 subparagraph.
3 (g)  If the lead state regulator determines that an insurance holding company 
4 system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption from 
5 filing the group capital calculation under this subparagraph, the insurance 
6 holding company system shall file the group capital calculation at the next 
7 annual filing date unless given an extension by the lead state regulator based 
8 on reasonable grounds shown.
9 (3)  The ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to registration shall file 
10 the results of a liquidity stress test for each data year for which the insurer’s 
11 insurance holding company system is within the scope of that year’s NAIC 
12 Liquidity Stress Test Framework, as determined by the lead state regulator.
13 (a)  If this State is the lead state, the determination that an insurer is within 
14 scope or out of scope must be based on whether the insurer or its insurance 
15 holding company system meets at least one threshold in the applicable scope 
16 criteria, unless the superintendent determines, in consultation with the NAIC 
17 Financial Stability Task Force or its successor organization, that there is good 
18 cause to exclude an insurer or insurance holding company system that meets 
19 one or more thresholds or to include an insurer or insurance holding company 
20 system that does not meet any of the thresholds. In making that determination, 
21 the superintendent shall consider the goal of providing a stable experience base 
22 and avoiding insurers moving in and out of scope frequently.
23 (b)  A liquidity stress test under this subparagraph must be performed, and its 
24 results must be filed, in accordance with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test 
25 Framework’s instructions and reporting templates for that data year.
26 (c)  For the purposes of this subparagraph, any change to the NAIC Liquidity 
27 Stress Test Framework, including the data to be used in applying the scope 
28 criteria, is effective on January 1st of the year following the calendar year when 
29 the change is adopted by the NAIC.
30Sec. 12.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§8, ¶B-3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 16, §5, is 
31 further amended by amending subparagraph (5), division (a) to read:

33 at least annually, on a timetable consistent with the insurer's internal strategic 
34 planning processes, and submitted to the lead regulator of the insurer's 
35 insurance holding company system, as determined by the procedures within a 
36 financial analysis handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
37 Commissioners  the NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook or successor 
38 publication.  If the superintendent is not the lead regulator, the insurer shall 
39 submit the insurer's or insurance holding company system's most recent ORSA 
40 summary report to the superintendent on request.
41Sec. 13.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§8, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
42 §19 and affected by §34, is further amended to read:
43 C.  An insurer does not need to disclose on the registration statement filed pursuant to 
44 this subsection information that is not material to the purposes of this section. Unless 1

46 exchanges, loans or extensions of credit or investments involving 1/2 of 1% or less of 
47 an insurer's admitted assets as of December 31st immediately preceding are not 
48 material for purposes of this section; , except:
5 (1)  For purposes of the group capital calculation and liquidity stress test in 
6 accordance with paragraph B-1, subparagraphs (2) and (3);
7 (2)  When the instructions for a specific filing specify a different materiality 
8 threshold or specify that no materiality threshold applies; or

12 hazardous financial condition as defined by rule or a condition that would be grounds 
13 for a delinquency proceeding under chapter 57, the superintendent may require the 
14 insurer to secure and maintain either a deposit, held by the Treasurer of State on behalf 
15 of the superintendent, or a bond, as determined by the insurer at the insurer’s discretion, 
16 for the protection of the insurer for the duration of a contract or agreement or the 
17 duration of the condition for which the superintendent required the deposit or the bond. 
18 In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the superintendent shall 
19 consider whether concerns exist with respect to the affiliated person’s ability to fulfill 
20 all of its contracts or agreements if the insurer were to be put into liquidation. If the 
21 insurer is determined to be in hazardous financial condition or in a condition that would 
22 be grounds for a delinquency proceeding, and a deposit or bond is required, the 
23 superintendent has discretion to determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to 
24 exceed the aggregate value in any one year of all contracts or agreements secured by 
25 the deposit or bond, and whether the deposit or bond should be required for a single 
26 contract, multiple contracts or a contract with a specific person.

37 to obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer’s business 
38 and obtain access to the electronic operating systems on which the data is maintained 
39 or software that runs those systems either through assumption of licensing agreements 
40 or otherwise and shall restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating 
41 the insurer’s business. The affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other 
42 encumbrance to give the insurer access to all records and data in the event of the 
43 affiliate’s default under a lease or other agreement.

13SUMMARY
14 This bill amends the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, section 222 to enact the most 
15 recent revisions to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Holding 
16 Company Model Act, which establish the group capital calculation and liquidity stress test 
17 framework and provide additional safeguards to ensure the performance of contracts 
18 between a domestic insurer and its noninsurer affiliates.  The bill also provides a uniform 
19 definition of “National Association of Insurance Commissioners” or “NAIC” throughout 
20 Title 24-A and a unified framework for controlling access to confidential information when 
21 the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance engages 
22 outside contractors.14
