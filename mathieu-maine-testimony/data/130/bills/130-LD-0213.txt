Page 1 - 130LR0148(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §328-B, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 408, §1, is 
3 amended to read:
4 A.  "Cancer" means kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colon cancer, leukemia, 
5 brain cancer, bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, testicular cancer or , 
6 breast cancer or gynecologic cancer.
7SUMMARY
8 Under the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992, there is a rebuttable 
9 presumption that a firefighter who has contracted kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin's 
10 lymphoma, colon cancer, leukemia, brain cancer, bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, 
11 prostate cancer, testicular cancer or breast cancer has contracted the cancer as a result of 
12 that firefighter's employment.  This bill adds gynecologic cancer to the definition of 
13 "cancer" so that there is also a rebuttable presumption under that Act for a firefighter who 
14 contracts gynecologic cancer.
