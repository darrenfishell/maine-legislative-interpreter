Page 1 - 130LR0115(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, it is critically important that this legislation to further protect consumers 
4 from surprise medical bills take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period; and
5Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
6 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
7 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
8 therefore,
9Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
10Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4303-C, sub-§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 668, §2, is 
11 further amended to read:
12 B.  Except as provided for ambulance services in paragraph D, unless the carrier and 
13 out-of-network provider agree otherwise, a carrier shall reimburse the out-of-network 
14 provider or enrollee, as applicable, for health care services rendered at the greater of:
15 (1)  The carrier's median network rate paid for that health care service by a similar 
16 provider in the enrollee's geographic area  where the service was provided; and
17 (2)  The median network rate paid by all carriers for that health care service by a 
18 similar provider in the enrollee's geographic area  where the service was provided 
19 as determined by the all-payer claims database maintained by the Maine Health 
20 Data Organization or, if Maine Health Data Organization claims data is insufficient 
21 or otherwise inapplicable, another independent medical claims database specified 
22 by the superintendent;
23Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4303-E, sub-§1, ¶G, as enacted by PL 2019, c. 668, §3, is 
24 amended to read:
25 G.  When the difference between the out-of-network provider's charge and the median 
26 network rate pursuant to section 4303‑C, subsection 2, paragraph B, subparagraph (1), 
27 including any applicable enrollee cost sharing, is less than $750, a carrier shall 
28 reimburse the out-of-network provider directly for the provider's charges for the 
29 services rendered as long as the provider's charges do not exceed the 80th percentile of 
30 charges for the particular health care service performed by a health care professional 
31 in the same or similar specialty and provided in the same geographical area as reported 
32 in a benchmarking by the Maine Health Data Organization or, if Maine Health Data 
33 Organization claims data is insufficient or otherwise inapplicable, another independent 
34 medical claims database specified by the superintendent  and maintained by a nonprofit 
35 organization that is not affiliated with and does not receive funding from a carrier. An 
36 out-of-network provider may dispute more than one bill with the same carrier for the 
37 same health care service under this subsection as long as the total of the bills with that 
38 carrier for that health care service exceeds $750.
39Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
40 takes effect when approved.
Page 2 - 130LR0115(01)1SUMMARY
2 This bill provides that information on provider charges as reported by the Maine Health 
3 Data Organization or, if Maine Health Data Organization claims data is insufficient or 
4 otherwise inapplicable, another independent medical claims database specified by the 
5 Superintendent of Insurance must be used to determine the amount a carrier must reimburse 
6 an out-of-network provider under certain circumstances.  It removes the requirement that a 
7 benchmarking database be maintained by a nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with 
8 and does not receive funding from a carrier.  It bases the amount a carrier must reimburse 
9 an out-of-network provider or enrollee on the rate paid for a health care service in the 
10 geographic area where the service is provided rather than on the rate paid for a health care 
11 service in an enrollee's geographic area.
