apply to all health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2023. 
The amendment also includes language stating the Legislature's finding that the

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Requiring health plans to include coverage for medically necessary dental procedures for enrollees diagnosed with 
cancer will increase General Fund costs to the State Employee Health Plan beginning in the plan year that starts July 
1, 2023 by $28,516 in fiscal year 2023-24. The bill will also increase Highway Fund costs by $10,039 beginning in 
fiscal year 2023-24. These estimates are based on the assumption that this required coverage will increase costs to the 
plan by $0.23 per member per month (PMPM).
