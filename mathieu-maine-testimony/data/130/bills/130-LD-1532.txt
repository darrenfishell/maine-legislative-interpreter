32 submit more than one copy of ambient monitoring data or meteorological data more 
33 frequently than quarterly.
34 This bill also:
35 1.  Creates new hearing requirements for applications for air emission licenses or 
36 renewals;
37 2.  Creates new civil penalties for violation of air emission standards and requires any 
38 penalties recovered to be transferred to the municipality where the violation occurred;
