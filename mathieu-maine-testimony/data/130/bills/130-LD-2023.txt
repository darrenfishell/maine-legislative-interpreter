5 notarial act, a notarial officer certifies that the officer has complied with the requirements 
6 and made the determinations specified in sections 1904, 1905 and 1906.

22 manner that renders it unusable.  
232.  Lost or stolen stamping device.  If a notary public's stamping device is lost or

30 journal for 10 years after the performance of the last notarial act chronicled in the journal.
312.  Tangible medium or electronic format permitted.  A journal may be created on 
32 a tangible medium or in an electronic format.  A notarial officer shall maintain only one

34 regarding tangible or electronic records.  If the journal is maintained on a tangible medium, 
35 it must be a permanent, bound register with numbered pages.  If the journal is maintained

12 in accordance with subsection 1 and inform the Secretary of State where the journal is 
13 located.
146.  Alternative to retention.  Instead of retaining a journal as provided in subsection 
15 5, a former notary public may transmit the journal to the Secretary of State or a repository 
16 approved by the Secretary of State.
177.  Death or incompetency of notary public.  On the death or adjudication of 
18 incompetency of a current or former notary public, the notary public's personal 
19 representative or guardian or any other person knowingly in possession of the journal shall 
20 transmit it to the Secretary of State or a repository approved by the Secretary of State.

22selection of technology; acceptance of tangible copy of electronic record

32 pursuant to section 1928, the technology must conform to the rules.  The Secretary of State 
33 shall determine whether the technology proposed by the notarial officer is approved for use 
34 in this State.
353.  Tangible copy of electronic record.  A register of deeds may accept for recording 
36 a tangible copy of an electronic record containing a notarial certificate as satisfying any 
37 requirement that a record accepted for recording be an original if the notarial officer 
38 executing the notarial certificate certifies that the tangible copy is an accurate copy of the 
39 electronic record.

13 to the best of my abilities, the duties incumbent on me as a notary public according to the 
14 Constitution of Maine and the laws of this State, so help me God."
15 When a person is conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, the word "affirm" may be 
16 substituted for the word "swear" and the words "this I do under penalty of perjury" may be 
17 substituted for the words "so help me God."  
184.  Commission issued.  The Secretary of State shall issue to an applicant who has 
19 complied with this section a notary public commission valid for a term of 4 years.
205.  No immunity or benefit.  A commission issued under subsection 4 authorizes the 
21 notary public to perform notarial acts.  The commission does not provide the notary public 
22 any immunity or benefit conferred by the laws of this State on public officials or employees.
23§1923.  Examination of notary public
241.  Examination required.  An applicant for a notary public commission who does not

38 A.  Failure to comply with this chapter;
39 B.  A fraudulent, dishonest or deceitful statement or omission in the application for a 
40 notary public commission submitted to the Secretary of State;1

18 public is entitled to timely notice and hearing in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, 
19 subchapter 4.
203.  Remedies preserved.  The authority of the Secretary of State to deny, refuse to 
21 renew, suspend, revoke or impose conditions on a notary public commission does not 
22 prevent a person from seeking and obtaining other criminal or civil remedies provided by 
23 law.
24§1925.  Database of notaries public
25 The Secretary of State shall maintain an electronic database of notaries public: 
261.  Verification.  Through which a person may verify the authority of a notary public

40 false or deceptive advertising.
Page 18 - 130LR2632(01)13.  Restricted terms.  A notary public who is not an attorney licensed to practice law 
2 in this State may not use the term "notario" or "notario publico."
34.  Advertising requirements.  A notary public who is not an attorney licensed to 
4 practice law in this State may not advertise or represent that the notary public may assist 
5 persons in drafting legal records, give legal advice or otherwise practice law.  If a notary 
6 public who is not an attorney licensed to practice law in this State in any manner advertises 
7 or represents that the notary public offers notarial services, whether orally or in a record, 
8 including broadcast media, print media and the Internet, the notary public shall include the 
9 following statement, or an alternate statement authorized or required by the Secretary of 
10 State, in the advertisement or representation, prominently and in each language used in the 
11 advertisement or representation:  "I am not an attorney licensed to practice law in this State.  
12 I am not allowed to draft legal records, give advice on legal matters, including immigration, 
13 or charge a fee for those activities."  If the form of advertisement or representation is not 
14 broadcast media, print media or the Internet and does not permit inclusion of the statement 
15 required by this subsection because of size, the statement must be displayed prominently 
16 or provided at the place of performance of the notarial act before the notarial act is 
17 performed.
185.  Access to original records.  Except as otherwise allowed by law, a notary public 
19 may not withhold access to or possession of an original record provided by a person who 
20 seeks performance of a notarial act by the notary public.

22 a fine of not more than $5,000 may be adjudged.

24 is aggrieved by a violation of this section may initiate a civil action in the Superior Court 
25 against the violator for injunctive relief or damages or both.  If a court finds a violation of 
26 this section, the court may award to the person: 
27 A.  An amount equal to actual damages sustained by the person as a result of the 
28 violation;
29 B.  An amount equal to 3 times the actual damages; and 
30 C.  The costs of the action together with reasonable attorney's fees as determined by 
31 the court. 
328.  Attorney General action.  If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a 
33 person in the State has engaged in or is engaging in activities that violate this section, the 
34 Attorney General may initiate an action in the Superior Court to enforce this section.  
35§1927.  Validity of notarial acts  
36 Except as otherwise provided in section 1904, subsection 6, the failure of a notarial 
37 officer to perform a duty or meet a requirement specified in this chapter does not invalidate 
38 a notarial act performed by the notarial officer.  The validity of a notarial act under this 
39 chapter does not prevent an aggrieved person from seeking to invalidate the record or 
40 transaction that is the subject of the notarial act or from seeking other remedies based on 
41 the laws of this State other than this chapter or the laws of the United States.  This section 
42 does not validate a purported notarial act performed by an individual who does not have 
43 the authority to perform notarial acts.  This section does not limit the authority of the 
Page 19 - 130LR2632(01)44 Secretary of State to reject candidate or initiative or referendum petitions under Title 21-A 
45 on the basis of improper notarizations.  
3§1928.  Rules
41.  Rules.  The Secretary of State may adopt rules to implement this chapter.  Rules 
5 adopted regarding the performance of notarial acts with respect to electronic records may 
6 not require, or accord greater legal status or effect to, the implementation or application of 
7 a specific technology or technical specification.  The rules may:
8 A. Prescribe the manner of performing notarial acts regarding tangible and electronic 
9 records;
10 B.  Include provisions to ensure that any change to or tampering with a record bearing 
11 a certificate of a notarial act is self-evident;

25 bodies, such as a national association of secretaries of state; 
26 B.  Standards, practices and customs of other jurisdictions that enact provisions 
27 substantially similar to this chapter; and

29§1929.  Notary public commission in effect

33 notarial acts after July 1, 2023, shall comply with this chapter.

5SUMMARY
6 This bill implements the recommendations of the Secretary of State’s study on remote 
7 and online notarization pursuant to Public Law 2021, chapter 337.  The bill is based on the 
8 Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts as approved by the National Conference of 
9 Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 2018.
10 The bill adheres to the NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts definitions 
11 enacted in the Maine Revised Statutes, except that the official stamp encompasses the 
12 official notary seal. 
13 Maine statute has strong conflict of interest protections prohibiting performance of a 
14 notarial act for an immediate family member, except in the case of a marriage ceremony.  
15 The bill includes that current restriction, together with the uniform law's additional 
16 restriction on notarial acts involving records in which the notary public or notary public’s 
17 family member has a direct beneficial interest.  The bill also includes identical language 
18 from current Maine statute for the corporate conflict of interest provision and uses 
19 substantively the same language from current Maine statute that prohibits a notary public 
20 from notarizing the petitions for a referendum campaign in which the notary public is 
21 otherwise involved. 
22 The bill adheres to NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts language 
23 governing requirements for certain notarial acts and adds language to preserve the powers 
24 and responsibilities inherent in current law for protests of losses, records and copies.
25 With regard to the identification of an individual, this bill does not include NCCUSL's 
26 Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts provision that a license or other identification 
27 document may be expired for no more than 3 years for use in identification.  For some 
28 transactions, particularly in real estate, and for some notarial officers, an expired license or 
29 identification card is never acceptable. In other situations, for example with seniors who 
30 may no longer drive, a license that has expired may be an acceptable form of identification. 
31 The language in the bill allows the notarial officer the discretion currently allowed in Maine 
32 statute.
33 This bill retains the current authorization that allows attorneys-at-law duly admitted 
34 and eligible to practice in the courts of this State to perform notarial acts.  Additionally, 
35 NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts recommends that judges, clerks or 
36 deputy clerks of the court be authorized to perform notarial acts, and the bill includes these 
37 additional authorizations.
38 Uniform acknowledgement of the notarial acts of other jurisdictions is fundamental to 
39 the constitutional principle of interstate commerce and is included in the bill.  It is important 
40 to note that the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 4, sections 1911 through 1914 regarding 
41 uniform acknowledgement of notarial acts in other jurisdictions have the same legal 
42 meaning as current Maine statute under the Uniform Recognition of Acknowledgements 
43 Act passed in 1969.  1

Page 23 - 130LR2632(01)1 The bill permits any notarial officer, including notaries public, attorneys, judges, clerks 
2 and deputy clerks, to perform notarial acts for a remotely located individual in accordance 
3 with the criteria established in the bill.  The bill includes security measures, including 
4 identity proofing and recording requirements.  The bill includes language that permits the 
5 Secretary of State to assess a fee when the Secretary of State accepts service for a civil 
6 action in a dispute pursuant to a notarial act performed for a remotely located individual.  
7 The Secretary of State currently requires a fee for any service of process made to the 
8 Secretary of State.
9 The bill requires a notarial officer to execute a certificate of the notarial act which, 
10 when the act is performed by a notary public, includes the date of expiration of the notary 
11 public’s commission and the official stamp.  This is a consumer protection measure to assist 
12 in the ease of verification of the validity of the notary public.  The requirement of an official 
13 stamp and the date of expiration of the commission are departures from current Maine 
14 notary public law.  The bill includes provisions for destruction of the stamp under the 
15 Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which are also a departure from current Maine 
16 statute.
17 The bill adopts NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts recommendation 
18 that all notarial officers except attorneys-at-law be required to keep a journal of all notarial 
19 acts.  Maine is one of very few states that have not previously required notaries public to 
20 maintain a journal.  Journals can be an important safeguard for consumers and notaries 
21 public alike, serving as evidence that a notarial act was performed properly. 
22 The bill authorizes all notarial officers to perform a notarial act with respect to an 
23 electronic record.  A notarial officer must notify the Secretary of State prior to performing 
24 the first notarial act with respect to an electronic record.  The Secretary of State shall 
25 determine what technology is permissible via the rule-making process.
26 The bill establishes the qualifications of a notary public, which are largely aligned with 
27 the current qualifications under Maine statute.  The bill alters Maine’s current residency 
28 requirements, which limit applicants to residents of Maine and residents of New Hampshire 
29 who are employed in Maine or operate a trade or business in Maine, to conform to 
30 NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts recommendation that an applicant must 
31 be a resident or have a place of employment or practice in Maine.  Surety bonds are required 
32 for notaries public.  The bill preserves the current requirement in Maine statute that a 
33 dedimus justice administer a specified oath to the notary before the issuance of a 
34 commission.
35 The bill establishes a 4-year notary public commission.
36 The bill requires any notarial officer seeking to perform remote and online notarization 
37 to notify the Secretary of State, who will maintain a database of that information online. 
38 The Secretary of State currently maintains a searchable online database of notaries public. 
39 The bill adopts all of the NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts 
40 recommendations with regards to prohibited acts including requirements for advertising 
41 disclaimers.  The bill departs from NCCUSL's Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts by 
42 adding language to bring in enforcement provisions of current Maine statute to provide for 
43 consumer protection in the event of a fraudulent or improper notarial act.
Page 24 - 130LR2632(01)1 Currently, Maine is one of only 3 states that gives notaries public the authority to 
2 perform marriages.  The authority is found in the law on domestic relations, Title 19-A, 
3 section 655, rather than the law on notaries public.  This bill creates a separate marriage 
4 officiant license and eliminates the power of notaries public to perform marriage 
5 ceremonies.  A transition section is included to require the Secretary of State to issue a 
6 marriage officiant license for a term of 4 years to every notary public commissioned in this 
7 State as of July 1, 2023.  A notary public receiving a license may decline to accept it by 
8 providing written notice to the Secretary of State on a form designed by the Secretary of 
9 State.
10 This legislation takes effect July 1, 2023.
