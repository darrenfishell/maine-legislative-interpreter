Page 1 - 130LR0669(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, difficult economic times and a shift in how people work increase the need 
4 to make Maine more competitive in attracting new residents and businesses; and
5Whereas, the longer Maine waits to recognize occupational licenses and government 
6 certifications issued in other states, the more talent and investment Maine loses; and
7Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
8 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
9 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
10 therefore,
11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
12Sec. 1.  32 MRSA c. 147 is enacted to read:
