Page 1 - 130LR1514(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง3737, sub-ยง5 is enacted to read:
35.  Use of contracts to improve supply of care for infants, toddlers and preschool 
4children.  The department may use up to 25% of funding received each year from the child 
5 care and development block grant authorized under the federal Child Care and 
6 Development Block Grant Act of 1990 for providing child care services for contracts with 
7 providers of child care services at step 3 and step 4 under subsection 3 to increase the 
8 availability of care for infants, toddlers and preschool children up to 4 years of age.  The 
9 contracts must prioritize continuity of high-quality care and stable settings for infants, 
10 toddlers and preschool children up to 4 years of age but may support children in another 
11 age group.  To qualify for a contract, a provider of child care services under this subsection 
12 must have appropriate training in child development, child trauma, adverse childhood 
13 experience, child protective services and working with children with disabilities. The 
14 department shall ensure that any contracts issued are granted to providers of child care 
15 services under this subsection that prioritize the following at-risk populations:
16 A.  Infants, toddlers and preschool children up to 4 years of age receiving or who have 
17 received child protective services;
18 B.  Infants with disabilities or those referred by the Child Development Services 
19 System as defined in Title 20-A, section 7001, subsection 1-A;
20 C.  Infants whose parents are participating in a substance use disorder treatment 
21 program;
22 D.  Infants whose parents are or have been homeless in the preceding 6 months; and
23 E.  Infants in geographic areas of the State where parents have few opportunities to 
24 secure high-quality infant care.
25 The department shall submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the 
26 Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters no later than 
27 January 1st of each year, beginning in 2022, describing the use of contracts pursuant to this 
28 subsection.  The report must include the number of contracts, the percentage of block grant 
29 funding used for the contracts and the number, grouped by paragraphs A to E, of at-risk 
30 children.
31SUMMARY

33 State's federal child care and development block grant funding for contracts for high-
34 quality child care to underserved children and areas of the State.  The department is required 
35 to submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
