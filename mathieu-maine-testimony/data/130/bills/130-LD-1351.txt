20SUMMARY
21 This bill amends provisions of the Maine Criminal Code in Part A and provisions of 
22 the Maine Bail Code in Part B.
23 In Part A this bill strengthens the laws on unlawful sexual contact with a prohibited 
24 person, unlawful sexual touching and prohibited contact with a minor. The bill decreases 
25 the class of certain subsequent convictions of theft by unauthorized taking or transfer, theft 
26 by deception, insurance deception, theft of lost, mislaid or mistakenly delivered property, 
27 theft of services, theft by misapplication of property and receiving stolen property.  The 
28 bill increases the penalty for nonsupport of dependents and repeat convictions for engaging 
29 in prostitution and repeals the provisions of law that limit sentences for engaging in 
30 prostitution to fines.  With regard to certain crimes of theft, the bill raises the class of a 
31 Class E crime when at the time that the crime was committed the defendant has 2 or more 
32 prior convictions for that crime or a substantially similar crime or an attempt to commit 
33 that crime in Maine or another jurisdiction.  With respect to Class E crimes, the bill repeals 
34 provisions of law that limit the place of imprisonment to a county jail and allows 
35 commitment to the Department of Corrections.  Also, with respect to Class E crimes, the 
36 bill repeals the maximum term of imprisonment of 6 months, which is currently required 
37 to be imposed if the statute does not specify a term, and instead specifies that there may be 
38 no term of imprisonment imposed for a Class E crime unless a specific term is required by 
39 statute. The bill repeals the provision of law that prohibits sentences of probation for certain 
40 Class E crimes. 21
22
Page 10 - 130LR1309(01)1 In Part B this bill requires pretrial release for a person charged with a Class E offense.  
2 The bill increases from Class E to Class D the penalties for a person who fails to appear 
3 while on preconviction or postconviction bail and a juvenile who fails to report after stay 
4 of execution.  The bill raises the level of crime from Class E to Class D for a defendant on 
5 preconviction or postconviction bail who violates a condition of release.
