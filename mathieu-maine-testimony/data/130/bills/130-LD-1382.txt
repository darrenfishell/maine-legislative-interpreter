Page 1 - 130LR1686(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2903, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2019, c. 379, Pt. B, §7, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Excise tax imposed.  An excise tax is imposed on internal combustion engine fuel 
5 used or sold in this State, including sales to the State or a political subdivision of the State, 
6 at the rate of 30.0¢ per gallon until September 30, 2021, 34.0¢ per gallon from October 1, 
7 2021 to September 30, 2022, 37.0¢ per gallon from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, 
8 40.0¢ per gallon from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and 42.0¢ per gallon 
9 beginning October 1, 2024, except that the rate is 3.4¢ per gallon on internal combustion 
10 engine fuel bought or used for the purpose of propelling jet or turbojet engine aircraft. Any 
11 fuel containing at least 10% internal combustion engine fuel is subject to the tax imposed 
12 by this section.
13Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §3203, sub-§1-B, as amended by PL 2019, c. 379, Pt. B, §8, is 
14 further amended to read:
151-B.  Generally; rates.  Except as provided in section 3204‑A, an excise tax is levied 
16 and imposed on all suppliers of distillates sold, on all retailers of low-energy fuel sold and 
17 on all users of special fuel used in this State for each gallon of distillate at the rate of 31.2¢  
18 per gallon until September 30, 2021, 35.2¢ per gallon from October 1, 2021 to September 
19 30, 2022, 38.2¢ per gallon from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, 41.2¢ per gallon 
20 from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and 43.2¢ per gallon beginning October 1, 
21 2024.  Tax rates for each gallon of low-energy fuel are based on the British Thermal Unit, 
22 referred to in this subsection as "BTU," energy content for each fuel as based on gasoline 
23 gallon equivalents or the comparable measure for distillates.  The gasoline gallon 
24 equivalent is the amount of alternative fuel that equals the BTU energy content of one 
25 gallon of gasoline.  For purposes of this subsection, "base rate" means the rate in effect for 
26 gasoline or diesel on July 1st of each year.  A biodiesel blend containing less than 90% 
27 biodiesel fuel is subject to the rate of tax imposed on diesel.
28 A.  This paragraph establishes the applicable BTU values and tax rates based on 
29 gasoline gallon equivalents.

10 (1)  For compressed natural gas, BTUs per 100 standard cubic feet is 93,000, and 
11 there are 123.66 standard cubic feet per gasoline gallon equivalent.
12 (2)  For hydrogen, BTUs per 100 standard cubic feet is 27,000, and there are 425.93 
13 standard cubic feet per gasoline gallon equivalent.
14 (3)  For hydrogen compressed natural gas, BTUs per 100 standard cubic feet is 
15 79,800, and there are 144.11 standard cubic feet per gasoline gallon equivalent.
16Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §5213-B is enacted to read:
17§5213-B.  Fuel tax fairness credit
18 For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, an individual with federal adjusted 
19 gross income lower than the federal poverty level as defined under section 6271, subsection 
20 1, paragraph B is allowed a refundable credit of $100 against the taxes imposed under this 
21 Part.
22SUMMARY

24 3¢ per gallon beginning October 1, 2022, an additional 3¢ per gallon beginning October 1, 
25 2023 and an additional 2¢ per gallon beginning October 1, 2024.  The bill also establishes
