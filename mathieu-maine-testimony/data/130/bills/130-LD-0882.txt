Page 1 - 130LR0162(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §2430-E, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 452, §24, is amended to read:
3§2430-E.  Possession penalties; fraud penalty; administrative holds
41.  Excess marijuana; forfeiture.  A person who possesses marijuana plants or 
5 harvested marijuana in excess of the limits provided in this section shall forfeit the excess 
6 amounts to a law enforcement officer.  The law enforcement officer is authorized to remove 
7 all excess marijuana plants or harvested marijuana possessed by that person in order to 
8 catalog the amount of excess marijuana.  Possession of marijuana in excess of the limits 
9 provided in this section is a violation as follows:
10 A.  Possession of harvested marijuana by a qualifying patient or a caregiver operating 
11 under section 2423‑A, subsection 3, paragraph C in an excess amount up to 1 1/4 
12 ounces commits a civil violation for which a fine of not less than $350 and not more 
13 than $600 must be adjudged, none of which may be suspended;
14 B.  Possession of harvested marijuana by a qualifying patient or a caregiver operating 
15 under section 2423‑A, subsection 3, paragraph C in an excess amount over 1 1/4 ounces 
16 and up to 2 1/2 ounces commits a civil violation for which a fine of not less than $700 
17 and not more than $1,000 must be adjudged, none of which may be suspended; and
18 C.  Possession of harvested marijuana by a qualifying patient or a caregiver operating 
19 under section 2423‑A, subsection 3, paragraph C in an excess amount over 2 1/2 ounces 
20 is a violation of Title 17‑A, chapter 45.
212.  Repeat forfeiture.  If a cardholder or registration certificate holder has previously 
22 forfeited excess marijuana pursuant to subsection 1 and a subsequent forfeiture occurs, the 
23 department shall revoke the registry identification card of the cardholder and, as applicable, 
24 the cardholder's registration certificate and the entire amount of marijuana plants or 
25 harvested marijuana possessed by that cardholder must be forfeited to a law enforcement 
26 officer.  Nothing in this section may be construed to require a law enforcement officer to 
27 accept forfeited marijuana plants or harvested marijuana or to require a law enforcement 
28 officer or the department to bear the costs associated with the destruction or disposal of 
29 forfeited marijuana plants or harvested marijuana.  The department shall adopt rules to 
30 implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
31 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
323.  Defense for possession of excess marijuana.  Except as provided in section 2426, 
33 a qualifying patient may assert the medical purpose for using marijuana as a defense to any 
34 prosecution involving marijuana possession and may present evidence in court that the 
35 patient's necessary medical use or cultivation circumstances warranted exceeding the 
36 amount of marijuana allowed under section 2423‑A and was reasonably necessary to ensure 
37 the uninterrupted availability of marijuana for the purpose of treating or alleviating the 
38 patient's medical diagnosis or symptoms associated with the patient's medical diagnosis 
39 that, in a medical provider's professional opinion, may be alleviated by the therapeutic or 
40 palliative medical use of marijuana.
414.  Calculation of marijuana weight.  The amount of marijuana possessed under this 
42 chapter must be calculated by the weight of dried harvested marijuana. A calculation of the 
43 weight of marijuana that is not dried must reduce the weight by at least 75% to account for 
44 moisture content. A calculation of the weight of marijuana in a marijuana product may not 
Page 2 - 130LR0162(01)45 include ingredients in the product other than marijuana, except that the weight of marijuana 
46 concentrate must be included whether the marijuana concentrate is possessed by itself or 
47 within a marijuana product.
45.  Penalty for fraud.  Fraudulent misrepresentation regarding lawful possession or 
5 medical use of marijuana and fraudulent procurement under this chapter are governed by 
6 this subsection.  A person who misrepresents to a law enforcement official any fact or 
7 circumstance relating to the possession or medical use of marijuana under this chapter to 
8 avoid arrest or prosecution commits a civil violation for which a fine of $200 must be 
9 adjudged.
106.  Administrative holds.  In accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the 
11 department may impose an administrative hold on a registry identification cardholder or 
12 registration certificate holder or an assistant or other authorized agent of a registry 
13 identification cardholder or registration certificate holder if, as a result of an inspection or 
14 investigation by the department or a law enforcement agency, the department determines 
15 there are reasonable grounds to believe that entity has committed or is committing a 
16 violation of the provisions of this chapter, the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or the 
17 terms, conditions or provisions of a registry identification card or registration certificate 
18 issued to that entity.
19 A.  The department shall provide to a registry identification cardholder or registration 
20 certificate holder subject to an administrative hold, or whose assistant or other 
21 authorized agent is subject to an administrative hold, notice of the imposition of that 
22 administrative hold, which must:
23 (1)  Include a concise statement of the basis for the administrative hold, which may 
24 include without limitation that the registry identification cardholder or registration 
25 certificate holder possesses or otherwise controls:
26 (a)  Marijuana plants or harvested marijuana not appropriately tracked or 
27 disclosed in accordance with section 2430-G and the rules adopted pursuant to 
28 that section;
29 (b)  Harvested marijuana that is altered or not properly packaged or labeled in 
30 accordance with this chapter and rules adopted pursuant to this chapter;
31 (c)  Marijuana plants or harvested marijuana that has not been cultivated, 
32 harvested, manufactured or transferred or is otherwise not in a form in 
33 compliance with this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter; or
34 (d)  Marijuana plants or harvested marijuana that the department has a 
35 reasonable articulable suspicion may present a threat to public health or safety;
36 (2)  Detail any marijuana plants or harvested marijuana subject to the 
37 administrative hold;
38 (3)  Describe any operational restrictions to be placed on the registry identification 
39 cardholder or registration certificate holder during the duration of the 
40 administrative hold; and
41 (4)  Indicate actions that must be taken by the registry identification cardholder or 
42 registration certificate holder as a result of the administrative hold.1

5 or other authorized agent of a registry identification cardholder or registration 
6 certificate holder subject to an administrative hold must physically segregate any 
7 marijuana plants or harvested marijuana subject to the administrative hold, as detailed 
8 in the notice under paragraph A, from any other marijuana plants or harvested 
9 marijuana not subject to the administrative hold.  For the duration of the administrative 
10 hold, the registry identification cardholder or registration certificate holder may not 
11 sell, give away, transfer, transport, dispose of or destroy any marijuana plants or 
12 harvested marijuana subject to the administrative hold, but may, as applicable, 
13 cultivate, harvest, manufacture or otherwise maintain the marijuana plants or harvested 
14 marijuana subject to the administrative hold unless specifically restricted by the 
15 department from engaging in such activities pursuant to this subsection.
16 C.  A registry identification cardholder or registration certificate holder subject to an 
17 administrative hold shall, for the duration of the administrative hold, maintain any 
18 premises and otherwise continue to engage in authorized activities in accordance with 
19 all provisions of this chapter, the rules adopted pursuant to this chapter and the 
20 provisions of the administrative hold. Except as specifically restricted by the 
21 department pursuant to a notice under paragraph A, a registry identification cardholder 
22 or registration certificate holder may, for the duration of the administrative hold and as 
23 authorized pursuant to this chapter, cultivate, manufacture, test or sell any marijuana 
24 plants or harvested marijuana not subject to the administrative hold.
25 D.  The department may terminate an administrative hold at any time following the 
26 imposition of the administrative hold, except that an administrative hold under this 
27 subsection may not be imposed for a period exceeding 30 consecutive days from the 
28 date notice is provided to the registry identification cardholder or registration 
29 certificate holder or the assistant or other authorized agent of the registry identification 
30 cardholder or registration certificate holder in accordance with paragraph A.  Notice of 
31 termination of an administrative hold must be provided by the department to the 
32 registry identification cardholder or registration certificate holder or the assistant or 
33 other authorized agent of the registry identification cardholder or registration certificate 
34 holder.
35 E.  Subsequent to the termination of an administrative hold under paragraph D, the 
36 department, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter and the rules 
37 adopted pursuant to this chapter, may impose a fine on the registry identification 
38 cardholder or registration certificate holder or the assistant or other authorized agent of 
39 the registry identification cardholder or registration certificate holder that was subject 
40 to the administrative hold or suspend or revoke the registry identification card or 
41 registration certificate of that registry identification cardholder or registration 
42 certificate holder for a violation of the provisions of this chapter or the rules adopted 
43 pursuant to this chapter.

45 certificate holder" means a registered caregiver, caregiver retail store, dispensary, 
Page 4 - 130LR0162(01)46 manufacturing facility or person authorized to engage in marijuana extraction using 
47 inherently hazardous substances.

6 registry identification card or a registration certificate for violation of this chapter and the 
7 rules adopted under this chapter.  Revocation in accordance with section 2430-E, 
8 subsection 2 is considered a final agency action, subject to judicial review under Title 5, 
9 chapter 375, subchapter 7.  Unless otherwise specified as final agency action, a person who 
10 has had authorization for conduct under this chapter revoked due to failure to comply with 
11 this chapter and rules adopted by the department may request an informal hearing.  The 
12 department shall adopt rules to specify the period of time, which may not exceed one year, 
13 that the person whose registry identification card or registration certificate was revoked is 
14 ineligible for reauthorization under this chapter.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection 
15 are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
16 The department shall immediately revoke the registry identification card of an officer or 
17 director or assistant of a dispensary who is found to have violated section 2428, subsection
