412-A.  Criteria and process.  The commissioner shall establish criteria and a process 
42 for determining whether a prisoner resident of a correctional facility eligible for transfer to 
43 supervised community confinement as provided in subsection 2 is approved for transfer.  
44 The primary determining factor for approval must be the prisoner’s resident's likelihood of 
45 completion of supervised community confinement if transferred.
Page 11 - 130LR2663(01)1 A.  The criteria must be evidence-based and designed to evaluate the likelihood of a 
2 prisoner’s completion by a resident of a correctional facility of supervised community 
3 confinement if transferred.  The criteria must be specific and include, but may not be 
4 limited to, fulfillment of expectations as to conduct, fulfillment of expectations as to 
5 work, education and rehabilitation programs assigned in the case plan, other 
6 rehabilitative efforts and accomplishments, arrangements for suitable housing in the 
7 community, taking into consideration the proximity of this housing to the victim, and 
8 the existence of support systems and resources in the community.
9 B.  The process must reflect best practices for evaluating the likelihood of a prisoner’s 
10 completion by a resident of a correctional facility of supervised community 
11 confinement if transferred and must provide guidance to department staff as to how to 
12 apply the established criteria when conducting the evaluation.  The process must 
13 require, when information is obtained by the department from persons in the 
14 community for the purpose of determining whether to approve a prisoner resident for 
15 transfer to supervised community confinement, that those persons be informed of the 
16 prisoner’s resident's fulfillment of expectations as to conduct, fulfillment of 
17 expectations as to work, education, and rehabilitation programs assigned in the case 
18 plan and other rehabilitative efforts and accomplishments.   The process must also 
19 include the right of a prisoner resident who is eligible for transfer to supervised 
20 community confinement as provided in subsection 2 but who has not been approved 
21 for transfer to appeal that determination to the commissioner.
223.  Mandatory conditions for supervised community confinement.  Prisoners 
23 Residents of a correctional facility transferred to supervised community confinement are 
24 clients when they are accepted into supervised community confinement and are subject to 
25 the following mandatory conditions.
26 A.  The prisoner client must be involved in a program of work or education that is 
27 approved by the commissioner together with any treatment program that the

19 B.  Any condition that would be appropriate for the prisoner client and the supervised 
20 community confinement program.  The conditions imposed may be as stringent or

22 constitutionally imposed if the prisoner client were actually housed at a maximum 
23 security institution.
245.  Copy of rules.  Copies of rules must be provided to prisoners residents of a 
25 correctional facility as follows.

139.  Probation violation; revocation.  If a prisoner client on supervised community 
14 confinement violates a condition of supervised community confinement imposed on the 
15 prisoner client and if the violation conduct is also a violation of a condition of probation 
16 imposed as part of the sentence the prisoner client is serving while on supervised 
17 community confinement, a probation officer may file with any court a motion for 
18 revocation of probation and the court may revoke probation as specified in Title 17‑A, 
19 section 1812.
2010.  Terminally ill or incapacitated prisoner  resident of a correctional facility.  
21 With the consent of the prisoner  resident of a correctional facility, the commissioner may 
22 transfer a prisoner resident of a correctional facility committed to the department from a 
23 correctional facility to supervised community confinement status without meeting the 
24 eligibility requirements of subsection 2, paragraphs B and C and without meeting the 
25 criteria or fulfilling the process provided for under subsection 2-A if the department's 
26 director of medical care has determined that the prisoner resident of a correctional facility 
27 has a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition and that care outside a 
28 correctional facility is medically appropriate.  A resident of a correctional facility 
29 transferred under this subsection becomes a client notwithstanding that the person does not 
30 meet the requirements for supervised community confinement.  Except as set out in this 
31 subsection, the prisoner client must live in a hospital or other appropriate care facility, such 
32 as a nursing facility, residential care facility or a facility that is a licensed hospice program 
33 pursuant to Title 22, section 8622, approved by the commissioner.  As approved by the 
34 commissioner, the prisoner client may receive hospice services from an entity licensed 
35 pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1681, subchapter 1 or other care services provided by an entity 
36 approved by the commissioner and, subject to approval by the commissioner, may live at 
37 home while receiving these services.  The commissioner may exempt a prisoner client 
38 transferred to supervised community confinement pursuant to this subsection from any 
39 mandatory condition under subsection 3 that the commissioner determines to be 
40 inapplicable.  The prisoner client shall provide any information pertaining to the prisoner's 
41 client's medical condition or care that is requested by the commissioner at any time while 
42 the prisoner client is on supervised community confinement.   If the commissioner 
43 determines that the prisoner client has failed to fully comply with a request or if at any time 
44 the department's director of medical care determines that the prisoner client does not have 
45 a terminal or severely incapacitating medical condition or that care outside a correctional 
Page 14 - 130LR2663(01)46 facility is not medically appropriate, the commissioner shall revoke the transfer to 
47 supervised community confinement.
311.  Revocation of transfer.  The commissioner may revoke a transfer to supervised 
4 community confinement at any time for any reason in the commissioner's discretion.
512.  Information for prisoners  residents of a correctional facility.  The department

7 about supervised community confinement, including eligibility requirements, the 
8 application process and the criteria and process for determining whether a prisoner resident 
9 of a correctional facility eligible for transfer to supervised community confinement may be 
10 approved for transfer.
1113.  Data tracking.  The department shall track data for all prisoners residents of a 
12 correctional facility who apply for supervised community confinement and approval, denial 
13 and, if approved, completion of the program.  Such data must include, but is not limited to, 
14 demographic data regarding race and ethnicity, gender, age and convictions leading to the 
15 prisoner’s resident's current incarceration.

30 provide other assistance to prisoners clients housed at a reentry house, including, but not 
31 limited to, assistance with reentry planning.
324.  Transfer.  A prisoner resident of a correctional facility may be transferred to

38 contracted.
395.  Supervision.  All of the provisions of section 3036‑A and the rules adopted by the 
40 commissioner pursuant to section 3036‑A apply to a prisoner client housed at a reentry 
41 house, and supervision of the prisoner client must be conducted by a probation officer in
