This amendment reduces the number of Public Utilities Commission positions added by the bill from 5 Staff Attorney 
positions and 6 Utility Analyst positions to 1 Staff Attorney position and 2 Utility Analyst positions. It also reduces 
the one-time allocation for contracted services from $650,000 to $400,000 for a study, but moves it into fiscal year 
2022-23 from fiscal year 2023-24. The net incremental change is to increase allocations by $206,237 in fiscal year 
2022-23, but the allocations in subsequent years will be considerably less. As amended, in fiscal year 2022-23 the bill 
will include ongoing allocations of $499,028 for positions and related costs and the one-time allocation of $400,000 
for contracted services.
