2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4 This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to establish the Legal Defense Fund for the Maine Lobster Industry 
6 and a commission to administer the fund.  The commission would have 7 members, 
7 including 4 legislators who serve on the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
8 jurisdiction over marine resources matters, the Senate chair and House chair and the 
9 ranking member of the committee from the Senate who is a member of the party with the 
10 2nd highest number of seats in the Senate and the ranking member of the committee from 
11 the House who is a member of the party with the 2nd highest number of seats in the House.  
12 Also serving on the commission would be 3 licensed members of the lobster industry, one 
13 each appointed by the Governor, President of the Senate and Speaker of the House.  The 
14 commission would be charged with reviewing current and proposed laws, rules and 
15 regulations, both federal and state, concerning the lobster industry, determining the best 
16 course of action, including a response involving the legal system, and using the money in 
17 the Legal Defense Fund for the Maine Lobster Industry to carry out that course of action 
18 as appropriate.  The Legal Defense Fund for the Maine Lobster Industry would be funded 
19 by depositing 20Â¢ from the sale of each trap tag into the fund and by depositing 20% of the 
20 license surcharge for the State's lobster marketing collaborative into the fund. The laws 
21 governing the commission and the fund would be repealed in 2032.4
