This bill increases the registration fee to distribute a commercial feed in the State from $80 to $100 per product name 
for pet food, from $80 to $100 per product name for all other commercial feed and from $80 to $100 for a home-based 
manufacturer of pet food. The bill also changes the revenue distribution of these fees. Currently, 50% of the fees are 
credited to the Animal Welfare Fund (A WF) and 50% are credited to the General Fund. This bill would change the 
ratio to 60% A WF and 40% General Fund. The combination of higher registration fees and changed distribution ratio 
will not impact General Fund revenues but will result in an increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenues to the 
A WF of $279,360 starting in fiscal year 2022-23. 
The bill also increases the daily compensation for animal shelters holding animals pending court decisions from $5 to 
$15 for dogs and cats, from $8 to $18 for female cats or dogs with unweaned litters and from $10 to $20 for equines. It 
also increases from $8 to $20 the upper limit of daily compensation for holding livestock animals, excluding equines, 
fowl and rabbits. 
The bill includes allocations of $279,360 beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 to allow expenditure of the additional 
revenue, which will be more than sufficient to cover the higher compensation paid to animal shelters.
