This amendment includes a one-time allocation to the Public Utilities Conunission of $200,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 
for contracted services to complete the various studies added by this amendment. The PUC is funded by an assessment 
set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the Legislature for operating the PUC. The 
increased allocations in this bill require a corresponding increase in revenue from the assessment on transmission and 
distribution utilities.
