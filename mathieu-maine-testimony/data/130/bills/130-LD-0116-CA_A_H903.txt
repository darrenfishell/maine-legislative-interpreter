Under current law, antlerless deer are harvested by issuing free any-deer permits, which allow hunters to take either an 
antlered or antlerless deer in designated wildlife mamangement districts. This bill ends the use of the free any-deer 
pennit and creates a $12 antlerless deer pennit. Revenue from the pennits will be credited to the Deer Management 
Fund (DMF) in the Department of fuland Fisheries and Wildlife to be used to acquire and manage deer wintering 
habitat. Using an estimate of 67,587 permits, the new $12 fee will generate $811,044 annually beginning in fiscal year 
2022-23. The bill includes a corresponding allocation to allow expenditure of the additional revenue.
