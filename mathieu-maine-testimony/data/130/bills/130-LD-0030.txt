4Whereas, certain real estate authorized for conveyance by this resolve is within the 
5 designations described in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 598-A; and
6Whereas, title to the parcel of land underlying the veterans' home in Augusta was 
7 conveyed by the former Department of Conservation, Bureau of Public Lands to the Maine 
8 Veterans' Homes in order to provide security for the issuance of bonds to finance the 
9 construction of a veterans' home in Aroostook County and in southern Maine and the

11 State when all bonds described in subsection 1 of the deed conveying the property to the 
12 Maine Veterans' Homes mature and all outstanding principal, interest and premium, if any, 
13 on the bonds has been paid to the bondholders and any indenture mortgage securing the 
14 bonds has been defeased; and
15Whereas, once the parcel reverts, the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands 
16 within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is required to enter into
