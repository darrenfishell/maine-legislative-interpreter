8 offense of the criminal offense crime or juvenile crime charged, the defendant may be

10 criminal offense. A lesser included criminal offense is as defined under the laws of the 
11 State.
12Sec. 9.  30 MRSA §6209-A, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2019, c. 621, Pt. D, §4 and 
13 affected by §5, is further amended to read:
144.  Double jeopardy, collateral estoppel.  A prosecution for a criminal offense  crime 
15 or juvenile crime over which the Passamaquoddy Tribe has exclusive jurisdiction under

17 out of the same conduct, over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction.  A prosecution for 
18 a criminal offense  crime over which the Passamaquoddy Tribe has concurrent jurisdiction 
19 under this section does not bar a prosecution for a criminal offense  crime, arising out of the 
20 same conduct, over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction.  A prosecution for a criminal 
21 offense  crime over which the State has concurrent jurisdiction under this section does not 
22 bar a prosecution for a criminal offense  crime, arising out of the same conduct, over which

24 crime or juvenile crime over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction does not bar a 
25 prosecution for a criminal offense  crime or juvenile crime, arising out of the same conduct, 
26 over which the Passamaquoddy Tribe has exclusive jurisdiction under this section.  The 
27 determination of an issue of fact in a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted in a 
28 Passamaquoddy tribal forum does not constitute collateral estoppel in a criminal or juvenile 
29 proceeding conducted in a state court.  The determination of an issue of fact in a criminal 
30 or juvenile proceeding conducted in a state court does not constitute collateral estoppel in 
31 a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted in a Passamaquoddy tribal forum.
32Sec. 10.  30 MRSA §6209-B, sub-§1, as corrected by RR 2009, c. 1, §19, is

54.  Double jeopardy, collateral estoppel.  A prosecution for a criminal offense  crime 
6 or juvenile crime over which the Penobscot Nation has exclusive jurisdiction under this 
7 section does not bar a prosecution for a criminal offense crime or juvenile crime, arising 
8 out of the same conduct, over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction. A prosecution for 
9 a criminal offense  crime over which the Penobscot Nation has concurrent jurisdiction under 
10 this section does not bar a prosecution for a criminal offense  crime, arising out of the same

9 Issuance and execution of criminal process are also governed by the laws of the State. The 
10 procedures for the establishment and operation of tribal forums created to effectuate the 
11 purposes of this section are governed by federal statute, including, without limitation, the 
12 provisions of 25 United States Code, Sections 1301 to 1303 and rules and regulations

35 included offense. A lesser included criminal offense is as defined under the laws of the 
36 State.
374.  Double jeopardy; collateral estoppel.  A prosecution for a criminal offense  crime 
38 or juvenile crime over which the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has exclusive 
39 jurisdiction under this section does not bar a prosecution for a criminal offense crime or 
40 juvenile crime arising out of the same conduct over which the State has exclusive 
41 jurisdiction.  A prosecution for a crime over which the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
42 has concurrent jurisdiction under this section does not bar a prosecution for a crime, arising 
43 out of the same conduct, over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction.  A prosecution for 
44 a crime over which the State has concurrent jurisdiction under this section does not bar a 
45 prosecution for a crime, arising out of the same conduct, over which the Houlton Band of

2
Page 14 - 130LR1787(01)47 juvenile crime over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction does not bar a prosecution

49 the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has exclusive jurisdiction under this section. The 
50 determination of an issue of fact in a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted in a tribal 
51 forum does not constitute collateral estoppel in a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted 
52 in a state court. The determination of an issue of fact in a criminal or juvenile proceeding 
53 conducted in a state court does not constitute collateral estoppel in a criminal or juvenile 
54 proceeding conducted in a tribal forum.
95.  Houlton Band Jurisdiction Land.  For the purposes of this section, “Houlton Band 
10 Jurisdiction Land” means only the Houlton Band Trust Land described as follows:

17 County and recorded in the Aroostook County South Registry of Deeds in Book 2847, 
18 Page 114.
19 The designation of Houlton Band Jurisdiction Land in this subsection in no way affects the 
20 acquisition of additional Houlton Band Trust Land pursuant to applicable federal and state 
21 law, nor limits the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians from making additional requests that 
22 portions of the trust land be included in this subsection.
236.  Effective date; full faith and credit.  This section takes effect only if the State, the 
24 Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation agree to give full faith and credit to the

37SUMMARY
38 In this summary, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter 601, which is titled AN 
39 ACT to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement and was enacted by Public Law 
40 1979, chapter 732, is referred to as "the Maine Implementing Act" and the federal Maine 
41 Indian  Claims Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, formerly codified as 25 United 
42 States Code, Sections 1721 to 1735, is referred to as "the federal Settlement Act."  The 
43 federal Settlement Act ratified the Maine Implementing Act, and both have an effective 1

Page 15 - 130LR1787(01)44 date of October 10, 1980. This bill makes changes to the sections of the Maine 
45 Implementing Act describing land acquisition and criminal jurisdiction.
3 This bill extends the opportunity for tribal land acquisition to December 31, 2040 for 
4 both the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to add to their respective trust 
5 lands under the Maine Implementing Act. It also establishes a new category of land, the 
6 designated area for land acquisition. It provides that for the purposes of meeting the initial 
7 threshold of 150,000 acres, additional lands within the designated area for land acquisition 
8 that are contiguous to existing tribal lands may be purchased and certified by the United 
9 States Secretary of the Interior by January 31, 2030, for the benefit of the Passamaquoddy 
10 Tribe or Penobscot Nation.
11 The Maine Implementing Act currently limits the criminal jurisdiction of the 
12 Passamaquoddy Tribal Court and the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court as well as the potential 
13 criminal jurisdiction of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court. Federal Indian 
14 law provides broader jurisdiction for tribal courts.  This bill repeals most of the state 
15 limitations and recognizes and adopts most of federal Indian law, including the Indian Civil 
16 Rights Act of 1968, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and other federal laws addressing 
17 tribal court jurisdiction and the obligations of the tribal courts.  This bill amends the Maine 
18 Implementing Act to make equal the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy 
19 Tribal Court and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court with the exclusive 
20 criminal jurisdiction of the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court over offenses committed by 
21 Indian defendants against Indian victims or for which there is no victim.  This bill further 
22 amends the Maine Implementing Act to recognize the criminal jurisdiction of the 
23 Passamaquoddy Tribal Court, the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court and the Houlton Band of 
24 Maliseet Indians Tribal Court to impose the maximum penalties other tribal courts are 
25 authorized to impose under the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, as long as the 
26 due process protections required by that Act are observed.  
27 This bill amends state law to recognize tribal court jurisdiction, concurrent with the 
28 state courts, over offenses committed on tribal lands by Indian defendants against non-
29 Indian victims, subject to the maximum penalty provisions and due process requirements 
30 of the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010.  
31 This bill retains current law providing that the exclusive authority of the 
32 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to 
33 exercise criminal jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands remains at the discretion of the 
34 tribe, nation and band.  To the extent that the tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or 
35 terminates its exercise of, exclusive criminal jurisdiction, the State has exclusive 
36 jurisdiction over those matters. 
37 Unlike current law, this bill recognizes each tribal government's authority to define all 
38 crimes and juvenile offenses committed on its tribal lands over which the tribal court has 
39 exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction.  This bill, however, retains the authority of 
40 the State to define all crimes and juvenile offenses committed on tribal lands over which 
41 state courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction.
42 The bill takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First Special Session of the 
43 130th Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the First Special Session of 
44 the 130th Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification from: the Joint 
45 Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe that the tribe has agreed to its provisions; the 1

47 provisions; and the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the 
48 band has agreed to its provisions.1
