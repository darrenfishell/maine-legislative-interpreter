Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill changes the transfer from the General Fund to the ATV Recreational Management Fund from monthly to 
semiannually. It corrects an inconsistency with existing statutes created in PL 2021, c. 446. It results in a one-time 
increase in General Fund revenue of $45,000 in fiscal year 2022-23 and a one-time decrease in Other Special Revenue 
Funds revenue of $45,000. 
' 
Other provisions of the bill increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts not requiring any change to the budget. 
Additional costs to the Depa1iment of Administrative and Financial Services associated with the bill can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. Any reduction in revenue for municipalities is expected to be minor.
