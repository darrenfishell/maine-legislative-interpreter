Page 1 - 130LR0685(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  9-B MRSA §145, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 398, Pt. B, §2, is 
3 amended to read:
44.  Closing for cause.  A financial institution may temporarily close any of its offices 
5 for reasons that include but are not limited to good cause, emergency weather conditions 
6 and community events.  If a financial institution temporarily closes any of its offices for all 
7 or any part of a banking day, the institution shall post a conspicuous notice of the closing 
8 at all points of public access to the closed offices.  A closing may not become effective 
9 until such notice is posted at the office to be closed.  Posting this notice relieves the 
10 institution from liability for failure to perform any of the business of the financial institution 
11 at the closed offices.  A financial institution may not assess a late fee or other similar charge 
12 resulting from a transaction or duty not occurring on a day that the financial institution is 
13 closed under this subsection.  The superintendent may, by adopting rules, which are routine 
14 technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter II‑A  2-A, establish standards 
15 governing the form and content of the notice required under this subsection and may require 
16 dissemination of the notice of closing by any other reasonable means.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill forbids a financial institution from assessing a late charge or other fee 
19 otherwise due for a transaction or duty not occurring on a day that the financial institution 
20 closes early for good cause, emergency weather conditions, community events or other 
21 similar reasons.
