2Sec. 1.  21-A MRSA §698, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 371, §§23 and 
3 24, is further amended by amending the first blocked paragraph to read:
4 The sealed tamper-proof ballot security containers of used ballots must remain sealed for 
5 at least 2 months after the election, unless the Secretary of State authorizes the clerk to 
6 open the containers prior to that date.  After 2 months, the clerk shall open the containers 
7 in the presence of one or more witnesses and transfer the ballots to other containers for the 
8 remainder of the retention period described in section 23. The new containers must be 
9 securely sealed. Except as expressly authorized in this Title or other applicable state or 
10 federal law, the containers must remain sealed and in the possession, custody and control 
11 of the clerk until the used ballots are destroyed in accordance with section 23.
12Sec. 2.  21-A MRSA §739, first ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 258, §1, is further 
13 amended to read:
14 On request, a municipal clerk or the Secretary of State, or both, shall produce any 
15 ballots or incoming voting lists in their custody before the Governor, either branch of the 
16 Legislature, any legislative committee or a court of competent jurisdiction. Original ballots 
17 produced under this section must remain in the sole custody of the requester until they are 
18 returned to the municipal clerk or Secretary of State, and the requester shall maintain the 
19 ballots in a secure location. Inspection of ballots produced under this section is subject to 
20 oversight by a public official authorized by law to inspect ballots. If there is an unresolved 
21 disputed ballot for an election to the State House of Representatives or the State Senate 
22 arising from a recount conducted pursuant to section 737‑A, the Secretary of State shall 
23 make a copy of that ballot available for inspection by the public.  A copy of a ballot that is 
24 made available for public inspection pursuant to this section must be made available in a 
25 manner that preserves the voter's anonymity.  Copies of disputed ballots made available for 
26 public inspection under this section must be retained by the Secretary of State for a period 
27 of 2 years after the outcome of the election is finally determined.

332.  Transfer prohibited.  The municipal clerk may not transfer possession, custody or
