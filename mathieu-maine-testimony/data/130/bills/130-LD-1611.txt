15SUMMARY
16 This bill amends the definition of "commercial track" to include tracks at which fewer

18 determination by the State Harness Racing Commission that the lesser number is in the best 
19 interest of the State's harness horse racing industry and the lesser number of days receives 
20 the express written approval of the track and a statewide association of horsemen.
21 The bill also authorizes a person licensed to conduct harness horse racing with pari-
22 mutuel betting to sell pari-mutuel pools and common pari-mutuel pools for simulcast races 
23 at a facility that is approved by the State Harness Racing Commission.  The facility must 
24 be located within 25 miles of the racetrack where the licensed race is conducted and within 
25 a municipality with a population greater than 55,000, based on the 2010 U.S. Census.  It 
26 also authorizes the person to conduct at the facility any other activities incidental to and 
27 permitted by the person's license.16
