34 of indigenous fish, the following standards apply.
35 (1)  The 30-day average dissolved oxygen criterion of a Class C water is 6.5 parts 
36 per million using a temperature of 22 degrees centigrade or the ambient 
37 temperature of the water body, whichever is less, if:
38 (a)  A license or water quality certificate other than a general permit was issued 
39 prior to March 16, 2004 for the Class C water and was not based on a 6.5 parts 
40 per million 30-day average dissolved oxygen criterion; or
41 (b)  A discharge or a hydropower project was in existence on March 16, 2005 
42 and required but did not have a license or water quality certificate other than a 
43 general permit for the Class C water.
Page 4 - 130LR2597(01)1 This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and water quality certificates 
2 issued on or after March 16, 2004.
3 (2)  In Class C waters not governed by subparagraph (1), dissolved oxygen may 
4 not be less than 6.5 parts per million as a 30-day average based upon a temperature 
5 of 24 degrees centigrade or the ambient temperature of the water body, whichever 
6 is less.  This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and water quality 
7 certificates issued on or after March 16, 2004.
8 The department may negotiate and enter into agreements with licensees and water 
9 quality certificate holders in order to provide further protection for the growth of 
10 indigenous fish.  Agreements entered into under this paragraph are enforceable as 
11 department orders according to the provisions of sections 347-A to 349.
12 Between April 15th and October 31st, the number of Escherichia coli bacteria in Class 
13 C waters may not exceed a geometric mean of 100 CFU or MPN per 100 milliliters 
14 over a 90-day interval or 236 CFU or MPN per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the 
15 samples in any 90-day interval.   The board shall adopt rules governing the procedure 
16 for designation of spawning areas. Those rules must include provision for periodic 
17 review of designated spawning areas and consultation with affected persons prior to 
18 designation of a stretch of water as a spawning area.

23 other appropriate criteria. Class GPA waters must have a stable or decreasing trophic 
24 state, subject only to natural fluctuations, and must be free of culturally induced algal 
25 blooms that impair their use and enjoyment.  The number of Escherichia coli bacteria 
26 in these waters may not exceed a geometric mean of 29 CFU or MPN per 100 milliliters 
27 over a 90-day interval or 194 CFU or MPN per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the
