3Whereas, Public Law 2021, chapter 387 requires the Department of Administrative 
4 and Financial Services’ office of marijuana policy to adopt major substantive rules relating 
5 to the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act; and
6Whereas, any rules adopted by the department will have significant effects on Maine's 
7 medical marijuana patients and thousands of registered medical marijuana caregivers and 
8 associated businesses across the State; and
9Whereas, this warrants meaningful legislative oversight and approval; and
10Whereas, the department has authority to adopt rules prior to the expiration of the 90-
11 day period; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15 therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

26 provisionally adopted by the department in accordance with this subsection and submitted

29 to this subsection, the department shall consult with caregivers, registered caregivers, 
30 patients and medical providers with significant knowledge and experience certifying 
31 patients under this chapter.  The department shall develop a process to use when hiring 
32 consultants to advise on rule changes related to this chapter and shall report any subsequent

34 jurisdiction over medical use of marijuana matters.
