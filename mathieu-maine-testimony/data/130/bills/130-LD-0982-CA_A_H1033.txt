SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It creates a new section in the Maine Human Rights 
Act that states it is unlawful discrimination for a public entity to discriminate against, 
exclude from participation in or otherwise deny the benefits of the services, programs or 
activities of a public entity to any individual by reason of the individual's race, color, sex, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or 
national origin. It amends existing sections of the Maine Human Rights Act to create 
consistency with the new section.

This bill may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. The additional workload associated with the 
minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require additional funding at this time. The collection 
of additional filing fees may increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $496,965 in fiscal year 2022-23 to the Department of Corrections for 
3 Prison Administration Coordinator positions, related costs to review, process and investigate additional claims of 
discrimination and to reimburse the Attorney General's office for work performed on the department's behalf. 
The bill also includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $134,448 beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 to 
establish one Assistant Attorney General position in the Litigation Division of the Office of the Attorney General and 
provide funding for related All Other costs. 
Any additional costs to the Maine Human Rights Commission du~ to an increase in complaints filed are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed ~thin existing budgeted resources.
