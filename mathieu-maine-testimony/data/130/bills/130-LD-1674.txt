10SUMMARY
11 This bill establishes resident health care committees in all adult correctional facilities

13 requirements for resident health care committees, the process for selecting members and 
14 the duties of the resident health care committees.  The bill requires the department to adopt 
15 routine technical rules to implement those provisions.  The bill requires the department to 
16 collaborate with resident health care committees to annually report to the joint standing 
17 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal justice and public safety 
18 matters on the adequacy of medical and mental health services in correctional facilities.
19 The bill prohibits the department from charging a client a fee to access the client's 
20 medical records, from charging indigent clients fees for medical services and from charging 
21 fees for medical services when the client does not have sufficient funds.  The bill provides 
22 a client with the right to be transported and accompanied to medical and mental health 
23 service providers by corrections officers of the client's gender or of an appropriate gender 
24 and to receive medical and mental health services without the presence of a corrections 
25 officer under certain circumstances.  The bill also requires the department to adopt routine 
26 technical rules to delineate between searches of property and strip and body cavity searches
