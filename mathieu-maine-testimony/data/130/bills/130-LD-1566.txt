Page 1 - 130LR1869(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the State is currently in a prolonged state of emergency and a global 
4 pandemic has decimated certain industries such as live entertainment; and
5Whereas, the health of these affected industries is crucial because they are major 
6 industries in the State, contributing substantially to the state economy and representing tens 
7 of thousands of jobs; and
8Whereas, many of these industries were not able to operate profitably, if at all, in 
9 2020 and are unable financially to wait until the economy returns to normal and may fail 
10 or go out of business in the near future, especially if the adverse effects of the pandemic 
11 last throughout the remainder of this year; and
12Whereas, many performers and other workers who produced or supported live 
13 entertainment are of modest means and are suffering financially by not receiving work or 
14 revenue during the state of emergency; and
15Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
16 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
17 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
18 therefore, be it
19Sec. 1.  Department of Economic and Community Development to create 
20and administer fund to provide live entertainment venue, performer and 
21worker and public art recovery grants.  Resolved:  That the Department of 
22 Economic and Community Development shall create and administer a fund, referred to in 
23 this resolve as "the fund," to operate a program to provide live entertainment venue, 
24 performer and worker and public art recovery grants, referred to in this resolve as "the 
25 program."  The sources of funds for the fund are any funds derived from the Federal

28 and are eligible to be used for the purposes of the program, funds appropriated by the State 
29 and funds from any other public or private sources.  The purpose of the program is to 
30 compensate eligible businesses, performers and workers for revenue and profits lost in 
31 calendar year 2020 as a result of state-directed closures or economic disruptions due to the 
32 restrictions enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19.  An application may be made by an

25 Revenue Services.  Funds received under the program are reportable income for tax filing

26 businesses and performers and nonemployee workers, to compensate for the loss of revenue 
27 and profits due to state-ordered closures or restrictions to prevent the spread of the 
28 coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, and for public art to be funded partly by any 
29 federal funds received by the State in 2021 eligible to be used for that purpose.  For the 
30 purpose of this resolve, a live entertainment venue includes any business operation 
31 providing entertainment, including theater, music, other performing arts, cinema, sports, 
32 lectures or horse or harness racing, at a venue in which customers attend in person to view

36 resolve appropriates $10,000,000 to the fund and directs that $20,000,000 of any funds 
37 received from the Federal Government in 2021 that are eligible to be used for the purposes
