10 Funding for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Diagnostic and Research 
11 Laboratory" 
12 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
13 'An Act To Repeal the Pesticide Container Fee and the Tick Laboratory and Pest 
14 Management Fund' 
15 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the following: 
16 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
17 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
18 Whereas, in June 2020, Public Law 2019, chapter 548 went into effect imposing a fee 
19 of 15 ¢ per container on the retail sale in the State of pesticide products registered with the 
20 Board of Pesticides Control; and 
21 Whereas, implementation of the law has proven to be problematic and complex for 
22 retailers across the State; and 
23 Whereas, although the Legislature appreciates the intent to fund research related to 
24 tick and brown tail moth pest management, the pesticide container fee has put retailers at 
25 risk with Maine Revenue Services; and 
26 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
27 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
28 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
29 therefore,'
