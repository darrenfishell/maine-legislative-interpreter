SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. 
The amendment clarifies that health insurance carriers may not deny treatment for 
mental health treatment services that use evidence-based practices and are determined to 
be medically necessary health care for an individual 21 years of age or younger. The 
amendment defines "evidence-based practices" as clinically sound and scientifically based 
policies, practices and programs that reflect expert consensus on the prevention, treatment 
and recovery science, including, but not limited to, policies, practices and programs 
published and disseminated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration and the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse within the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services, the What Works Clearinghouse within 
the United States Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences and the 
California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare within the California 
Department of Social Services, Office of Child Abuse Prevention. 
The amendment also makes technical changes to state law requirements .related to 
mental health parity to be consistent with federal law and regulations. Changes to the 
mental health parity provisions were initially codified in state law in Public Law 2019, 
chapter 5, Part D. The amendment makes further technical changes that were not included 
at that time.
