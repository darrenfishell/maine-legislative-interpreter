47 of or interest or premium on such bonds.  The issuance of bonds or refunding of bonds 
48 under this chapter may not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy

50 payment of the bonds or the interest or premium on the bonds.

25 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utility matters.
26§4210.  Property of authority; eminent domain
27 The authority shall hold and acquire property as follows.

36 authority, or permitted to be installed or erected by the authority.

Page 9 - 130LR1455(01)42 easements and other property the authority determines necessary or convenient.  Title to 
43 any property taken by eminent domain must be in the name of the authority.
34.  Entry upon lands.  The authority and its authorized agents and employees may 
4 enter upon any lands, waters and premises in the State for the purpose of making surveys, 
5 soundings, drillings and examinations as the authority determines necessary or convenient 
6 for the purpose of this chapter and the entry may not be deemed a trespass.
75.  Authority for transfers of interest in land to authority.  Notwithstanding any 
8 provision of law to the contrary, all counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions 
9 and all public agencies and commissions of the State and all public service corporations

11 on such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of the counties, municipalities, 
12 political subdivisions, agencies, commissions, public service corporations and districts 
13 determine reasonable and fair and without the necessity for any advertisement, order of 
14 court or other action or formality other than the regular and formal action of the authorities 
15 concerned, any real or personal property or rights therein that may be necessary or 
16 convenient to the effectuation of the authorized purposes of the authority, including real 
17 and personal property or rights therein already devoted to public use. As used in this 
18 subsection, the term "public service corporation" includes every public utility as defined in

23 of this chapter, the authority may provide by resolution from time to time for the issuance

25 to be bonds under this chapter, but not exceeding $1,500,000,000 in the principal amount 
26 at any one time outstanding, exclusive of refunding, for any lawful purpose of the authority.
272.  Bonds; negotiable; not debt of State.  The bonds of the authority do not constitute 
28 a debt of the State or of any agency or political subdivision of the State and are payable 
29 solely from the operating revenues of the authority.  Notwithstanding any provision of law 
30 to the contrary, any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter are fully negotiable.  If any of the 
31 members or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on the bonds or coupons 
32 cease to be members or officers before the delivery of the bonds, the signature is, 
33 nevertheless, valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the members or officers had 
34 remained in office until that delivery.
35 Whether or not the bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments 
36 under Title 11, Article 8-A, the bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the 
37 meaning of and for all the purposes of Title 11, Article 8-A, subject only to the provisions 
38 of the bonds for registration.
39 It is the intention of this chapter that any pledge made by the authority in respect to the 
40 bonds or notes is valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, that the funds 
41 or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority is immediately subject to 
42 the lien of that pledge without any physical delivery of those funds or property or further 
43 act and that the lien of such a pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims 
44 of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority irrespective of whether those 1
2
Page 10 - 130LR1455(01)45 parties have notice of that lien.  The resolution, trust indenture or any other instrument by 
46 which a pledge is created need not be recorded.

4 bonds:
5 A.  The manner of executing the bonds and coupons;
6 B.  The form and denomination of the bonds;
7 C.  Maturity dates;

33 may otherwise be provided in that resolution or trust indenture or loan or other security 
34 agreement, the sinking fund must be a fund for the benefit of all bonds issued under this 
35 chapter without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the 
36 resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or of the trust indenture or loan or other 
37 security agreement, any money in the sinking fund in excess of an amount equal to one 
38 year's interest on all bonds then outstanding may be applied to the purchase or redemption 
39 of bonds.  All bonds so purchased or redeemed must immediately be canceled and may not

12 for a period of 60 days or defaults in any other agreement with the bondholders or with a 
13 trustee under a trust indenture or loan or security agreement, the holders of 25% in 
14 aggregate principal amounts of the bonds then outstanding by instrument filed in the office 
15 of the Secretary of State duly acknowledged may appoint a trustee to represent the 
16 bondholders for the purpose provided in this section.  The trustee may upon the written 
17 request of the holders of 25% in principal amount of the bonds then outstanding:

25 right, to the appointment of a receiver who may, to the extent that the authority could itself 
26 do, enter and take possession of the facilities of the authority or any part thereof, the 
27 revenue or receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds in 
28 default, and operate and maintain the facilities and collect and receive all revenue thereafter 
29 arising from the facilities in the same manner as the authority might do and shall deposit 
30 all such money in a separate account and apply the money in such manner as the court 
31 directs.  In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee, the fees, counsel fees and expenses 
32 of the trustee and the receiver, if any, and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court 
33 must be a first charge on any authority revenues, the revenues and receipts from which are 
34 or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default.  The trustees, in addition, 
35 have and possess all the powers necessary and appropriate for the exercise of any functions 
36 specifically set forth in this section or incident to the general representation of the 
37 bondholders in the enforcement and protection of their rights.  Except as may otherwise be 
38 provided in a bond resolution or trust indenture or loan or other security agreement, in 
39 addition to other rights and limitations, any bondholder has the right by mandamus or other 
40 suit, action or proceeding in law or in equity to enforce the bondholder's rights against the 
41 authority, including the right to require the authority to carry out any agreement or covenant

23SUMMARY
24 This bill establishes the Maine Generation Authority as a state authority authorized to 
25 issue revenue bonds that are backed by Maine electric ratepayers.
26 The purpose of the authority is to finance and own electricity generation projects that 
27 generate electricity using renewable fuels that produce zero greenhouse gas emissions and 
28 that are located in the State or, for those located in federal waters in the Gulf of Maine, 
29 capable of delivering all electricity generated into Maine in amounts sufficient to meet or 
30 offset residential and business energy requirements, and electricity storage systems located 
31 in the State that can store sufficient quantities of electricity generated by renewable 
32 generation projects to enable Maine's electricity grid to meet total in-state demands for 
33 electricity at all times.
34 The governance structure, administration, powers, obligations, property rights and 
35 bond issuance authority of the authority are modeled on the Maine Turnpike Authority.  
36 The amount of authorized bonding is intended to provide sufficient funding to allow the 
37 authority to meet the energy and storage targets set forth in the bill.
38 The bill authorizes the authority to undertake the following activities in fulfillment of 
39 its purpose:
40 1. Acquire fee simple ownership or easements in or enter long-term leases of real estate
