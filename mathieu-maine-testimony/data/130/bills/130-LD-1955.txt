32 sponsor within 7 days of that acceptance;
33 D.  Synchronize the customer's net energy billing cycle with the project sponsor's net 
34 energy billing cycle so that net energy billing credits are applied in real time;
35 E.  Implement automated billing and crediting procedures determined by the 
36 commission to be necessary to ensure billing accuracy and timeliness;

19 participation in any energy conservation or assistance program, participation in any 
20 other net energy billing or demand-response program or in any electric vehicle 
21 charging program; and

5 information about the complaints received and any evaluative information the commission 
6 determines would be useful to current or prospective net energy billing customers.
7SUMMARY
8 This bill establishes various requirements for transmission and distribution utilities to 
9 share information, handle billing and otherwise interact with customers and project 
10 sponsors in net energy billing arrangements, including timely delivery of net energy billing 
11 data, synchronization of billing cycles, application of net energy billing credits and 
12 development of a mechanism for electronic access to data in near real time. The bill requires 
13 the Public Utilities Commission to establish a complaint handling process for project 
14 sponsor complaints about transmission and distribution utility compliance with data 
15 sharing and billing requirements and provides that the commission may direct a 
16 transmission and distribution utility to pay costs resulting from billing errors.8
