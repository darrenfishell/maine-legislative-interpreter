22 a majority of the legal voters casting ballots at the general election, and the total number of 
23 votes cast for and against the acceptance of this Act at the election must equal or exceed 
24 50% of the total number of votes cast in the county for Governor at the last gubernatorial 
25 election.
26 The result of a referendum must be declared by the county commissioners or county 
27 administrators and due certificate filed with the Secretary of State within 10 days after the 
28 date of the election.
