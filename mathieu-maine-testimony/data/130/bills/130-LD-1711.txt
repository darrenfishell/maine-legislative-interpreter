21 under Title 5, chapter 337, subchapter 3.  A whistleblower may seek injunctive or 
22 declaratory relief that the State would be entitled to seek.  A private enforcement action

24 conduct occurred and may allege multiple violations that have affected different parties 
25 aggrieved by the same defendant.  A whistleblower may select a representative 
26 organization to initiate a private enforcement action on the whistleblower's behalf.
27§840-C.  Procedure
281.  Required notice; filing fee.  Before filing a private enforcement action under this 
29 subchapter, a whistleblower must submit written notice of the claim and a filing fee of $75 
30 to the Attorney General or the appropriate responsible state official.  The time periods set 
31 forth in this section begin when both the notice and filing fee have been submitted.  The 
32 Attorney General or the responsible state official may waive the filing fee in accordance 
33 with rules adopted by the Attorney General and the responsible state official.
342.  Contents of notice.  The notice under subsection 1, construed in the light most 
35 favorable to the whistleblower, must include:
36 A.  The name, address and contact information of the alleged violator;
37 B.  If the whistleblower's identity is confidential, the name and contact information of

39 C.  If the whistleblower's identity is not confidential, the name and contact information 
40 of the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative organization;
Page 3 - 130LR0835(01)1 D.  If the whistleblower has retained legal counsel, the name, address and contact 
2 information of the legal counsel; and
3 E.  A concise statement of the underlying claim reasonably calculated to apprise the 
4 Attorney General or the responsible state official of the substance and nature of the

63.  Amended notice.  The Attorney General or the responsible state official has 30 
7 days to determine if the notice filed in accordance with subsection 1 is in compliance with 
8 this section and rules adopted pursuant to this section.  If the notice is not in compliance, 
9 the Attorney General or the responsible state official shall specify the deficiencies in the 
10 notice and allow the whistleblower to furnish an amended notice.  The whistleblower must 
11 provide the amended notice within 30 days of receiving the deficiency determination from 
12 the Attorney General or the responsible state official.  If a deficiency determination is not 
13 made within 30 days by the Attorney General or the responsible state official, the notice is 
14 considered to be in compliance with this section.
154.  Investigation; decision regarding action.  The Attorney General or the responsible 
16 state official who receives notice under subsection 1 has 180 days to investigate the alleged 
17 violation and initiate a private enforcement action.
185.  Prefiling settlement.  If the parties reach a settlement after the whistleblower has 
19 provided notice pursuant to subsection 1 but prior to the private enforcement action being 
20 filed in court, the Attorney General or the responsible state official shall review the 
21 proposed settlement.  The Attorney General or the responsible state official shall approve 
22 the settlement if the Attorney General or the responsible state official determines the 
23 settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable and in the public interest.  The parties shall also 
24 comply with any other requirement necessary to finalize settlement.
256.  Commencement of private enforcement action.  At any time after receiving the 
26 notice under subsection 1, the Attorney General or the responsible state official may notify 
27 the whistleblower that the whistleblower may commence a private enforcement action.  If 
28 the Attorney General or the responsible state official does not initiate an enforcement action 
29 within 180 days of receipt of the notice, the whistleblower may commence a private 
30 enforcement action.  If a whistleblower commences a private enforcement action under this 
31 subsection, the whistleblower shall submit a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General 
32 or the responsible state official.
337.  Intervention by State.  Within 30 days after the filing of a private enforcement 
34 action under subsection 6, the Attorney General or the responsible state official may 
35 intervene and proceed with any claim in the private enforcement action.  After the 
36 expiration of the 30-day period, the Attorney General or the responsible state official may 
37 intervene in the private enforcement action for good cause shown, as determined by the 
38 court.
39 A.  If the Attorney General or the responsible state official intervenes in a private 
40 enforcement action:
41 (1)  The Attorney General or the responsible state official has primary 
42 responsibility for prosecuting the private enforcement action and is not bound by 
43 an act of the whistleblower bringing the private enforcement action;
44 (2)  The whistleblower remains a party to the private enforcement action;
Page 4 - 130LR0835(01)1 (3)  The Attorney General or the responsible state official may move to dismiss or 
2 settle the private enforcement action after the whistleblower has been notified of 
3 the filing of the motion and has been provided with an opportunity to be heard and 
4 the court determines that the dismissal or settlement is rationally related to 
5 accomplishing a valid governmental purpose and is not fraudulent, arbitrary and 
6 capricious or illegal; and
7 (4)  If the Attorney General or the responsible state official substantially prevails 
8 in the private enforcement action, the Attorney General or the responsible state 
9 official must provide fair compensation for the attorney's fees and costs expended 
10 on behalf of the whistleblower in instituting the private enforcement action.
11 B.  If the Attorney General or the responsible state official does not intervene in a 
12 private enforcement action, the whistleblower may prosecute the private enforcement 
13 action subject to the following limitations.
14 (1)  The court must review and approve any settlement of the private enforcement 
15 action.  The proposed settlement must be submitted to the Attorney General and 
16 the responsible state official at the same time that the proposed settlement is 
17 submitted to the court.  The court may approve a settlement or dismissal of the 
18 private enforcement action only upon a determination that the settlement or 
19 voluntary dismissal is fair, adequate, reasonable and in the public interest.
20 (2)  The Attorney General or the responsible state official may attend to the 
21 interests of the State in the private enforcement action or to any other interest of 
22 the State.
238.  Prompt trial.  Concurrent adjudication of another private claim may not delay a 
24 private enforcement action.
259.  Not subject to rules governing class action suits.  A private enforcement action is 
26 not required to meet the requirements governing class action suits in the Maine Rules of 
27 Civil Procedure, Rule 23.
2810.  Pretrial discovery.  The court rules governing pretrial discovery in a private 
29 enforcement action are the same as the rules applicable in other civil actions.  A special 
30 showing of merit or other additional requirement may not be imposed on a whistleblower's 
31 discovery rights in a private enforcement action.
3211.  Action based on same facts.  If a whistleblower brings a private enforcement 
33 action, another person may not bring a related private enforcement action based on the 
34 same facts unless the court determines that the previously filed private enforcement action 
35 was not diligently prosecuted. 
3612.  Private agreement may not impair right.  The right to bring a private 
37 enforcement action under this section may not be impaired by any private agreement.
3813.  Commencement of action; statute of limitations.  Notwithstanding any 
39 provision of law to the contrary, a private enforcement action must be commenced within 
40 the same period of time that the Attorney General or the responsible state official has to 
41 bring an action for the same set of circumstances under the applicable statute.  The statute 
42 of limitations for bringing a private enforcement action is tolled from the date a 
43 whistleblower files a notice pursuant to subsection 1 or the date the Attorney General or 
44 the responsible state official commences an investigation, whichever is earlier.
Page 5 - 130LR0835(01)114.  Private action based on same injury.  This section does not limit the right for the 
2 whistleblower to pursue a private action based on the same injury.
315.  Rules.  The Attorney General and the responsible state official shall adopt rules to 
4 implement this section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical 
5 rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
6§840-D.  Penalties, fees and costs 
71.  Penalties.  For a private enforcement action brought pursuant to this subchapter:

14 penalty;

19 violation occurred; and
20 E.  The court may award a lesser amount of civil penalty than the amounts specified in 
21 this subsection if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do 
22 otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive or 
23 confiscatory.
242.  Attorney's fees; costs.  A whistleblower that prevails in a private enforcement 
25 action, including by recovering a civil penalty or obtaining declaratory or injunctive relief

3SUMMARY
4 This bill provides for a right of a whistleblower alleging a violation of certain labor 
5 laws to bring a private enforcement action on behalf of the State and in the name of the 
6 State after providing notice to the Attorney General, the Department of Labor or the Maine 
7 Human Rights Commission, depending on which law has been claimed to be violated.  The 
8 Attorney General, the Department of Labor or the Maine Human Rights Commission may 
9 choose to intervene, in which case the State takes primary responsibility for the private 
10 enforcement action.  If the State declines to intervene, the whistleblower is allowed to 
11 proceed with the private enforcement action.  Any settlement or voluntary dismissal of the 
12 private enforcement action must be reviewed and approved by the state agencies involved 
13 and, after the settlement or dismissal occurs after the filing of the private enforcement 
14 action, the court.  The bill provides for penalties if the private enforcement action succeeds, 
15 which vary depending on whether the State has intervened, and for distribution of the 
16 penalties, including 15% of any penalty received to be deposited into the Community 
17 Outreach and Labor Education Fund, created by the bill to assist workers enforcing 
18 employment rights, including outreach, community-based education events, training 
19 materials, technical assistance, counseling and investigative, research and referral services.1
