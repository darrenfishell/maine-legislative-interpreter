Fiscal Note 
Legislative approval may avoid constitutional conflict 
This bill provides legislative approval of an existing lease of certain lands in Dennistown Plantation. The lease was 
issued in 2016 to Christian Camps and generates annual revenue of less than $300. Approval is occurring now to 
avoid any potential conflict with certain constitutional requirements for real estate held by the State. Such approval 
will confirm the validity of the existing lease and there will be no impact on the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation, and Forestry.
