Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the Maine Gold Standard for Radon Testing and Mitigation Initiative within the Department of 
Health and human Services to reward, recognize, promote and assist landlords, homeowners and home builders who 
participate in radon testing and mitigation activities. If the landlord, homeowner or home builder meets certain 
requirements of the program, they will be able to receive $600 towards any mitigation required after the testing is 
complete. As it is unknown how many landlords, homeowners or home builders would do the required testing to 
meet the requirements of the program and how many of the tests would result in high levels that require mitigation, 
no cost estimate is made at this time.
