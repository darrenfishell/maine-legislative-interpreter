6 to stand trial and whom the court commits to the custody of the Commissioner of Health 
7 and Human Services under Title 15, section 101-D, subsection 5 if, in addition to the 
8 findings required under Title 15, section 101-D, subsection 5, the court, after hearing, finds 
9 that:
10 A.  The defendant is a person with mental illness and, as a result of the defendant's 
11 mental illness, it is more probable than not that the defendant poses a likelihood of 
12 serious harm to others;
13 B.  There is not sufficient security at a state mental health institute to address the

16 a correctional facility.
172.  Termination of placement.  The commissioner may terminate the placement of a

20 mental health institute has increased or for any other reason.
213.  Disclosure of information.  With respect to an adult defendant who has previously 
22 been hospitalized under Title 34-B, chapter 3, subchapter 4, the commissioner may make 
23 it a prerequisite to accepting placement of the defendant under this section that necessary 
24 information be disclosed to the department pursuant to Title 34-B, section 1207, subsection 
25 1, paragraph B.
264.  Application of other laws.  All other applicable provisions of law governing
