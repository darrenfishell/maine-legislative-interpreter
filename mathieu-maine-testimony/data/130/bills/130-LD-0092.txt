2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, in 2007, the Legislature established the waste motor oil disposal site 
4 remediation program pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 1020-A to 
5 help eligible responsible parties pay their share of response costs associated with the 
6 cleanup of sites in Casco, Ellsworth, Plymouth and Presque Isle formerly operated by the 
7 now-defunct Portland-Bangor Waste Oil Company; and
8Whereas, the program authorized the Finance Authority of Maine, among other 
9 things, to issue bonds to fund the response costs of eligible responsible parties at the sites; 
10 and
11Whereas, the bond payments were successfully made with revenues collected from 
12 various premiums on motor oil changes, bulk motor vehicle oil and prepackaged motor oil 
13 sales and motor vehicle oil sold in various sizes and refinements; and
14Whereas, the program generated sufficient revenues to enable payment of all debt 
15 service and other expenses related to the bonds as well as other related statutory obligations 
16 so that all obligations for past costs have been fully met; and
17Whereas, the bonds have been fully redeemed and retired early by the Finance 
18 Authority of Maine; and

20 direct the remaining excess funds and conclude the program; and
