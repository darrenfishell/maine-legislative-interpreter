72.  Proof of ownership required.  An employer in this State who applies for a bond 
8 worker in a logging occupation shall provide proof of the employer's ownership of any 
9 logging equipment used by that worker in the course of employment, including proof of 
10 ownership of at least one piece of logging equipment for every 2 bond workers employed 
11 by the employer in a logging occupation.  The employer shall provide proof of ownership 
12 as required by this subsection on a form provided by the Commissioner of Labor.  The 
13 proof required by this subsection must include, but not be limited to, a receipt for payment 
14 for the equipment purchased in a bona fide transaction and documentation of payment of 
15 any tax assessed on the equipment pursuant to Title 36, chapter 105 for the year in which 
16 the bond worker is employed by the employer.  Proof of ownership must be carried in the 
17 equipment and, upon request by the department or its designee, the operator of equipment 
18 subject to this section shall provide proof of ownership.  If proof of ownership is not 
19 provided within 30 14 calendar days of such a request, a fine of not less than $5,000 and 
20 not more than $25,000 may be assessed against that employer and collected by the 
21 Commissioner of Labor.  Notwithstanding section 3, information regarding proof of 
22 ownership is not confidential and may be disclosed to the public. If the equipment is leased 
23 by the employer, the employer shall provide the name, address and telephone number of 
24 the leasing company and its affiliates and subsidiaries; the names, addresses and telephone 
25 numbers of the leasing company's owner or owners, its agent and members of its board of 
26 directors; and a copy of the lease document.  A lease is sufficient to meet the ownership 
27 requirement of this section only if it is a bona fide lease and:
28 A.  The lease consists of an arm’s length transaction between unrelated entities or is a 
29 transfer of equipment between affiliated companies;
30 B.  The lease document contains a specific duration and lease amount;
31 C.  The lessor is not an entity owned or controlled by a bond worker or a bond worker’s 
32 spouse, parent, child, sibling, aunt, uncle or cousin or person related to a bond worker 
33 in the same manner by marriage, or by any combination of a bond worker and the bond 
34 worker’s family members described in this paragraph;
35 D.  The lessor is a leasing business as evidenced by a lease of logging equipment to at 
36 least 3 different, unrelated entities within each of the past 3 years; and
37 E.  The lessor provides proof of payment of personal property tax assessed on the leased 
38 equipment.

45 equipment, including serial number, a bond worker will operate; receipts for payment for 
46 the logging equipment purchased in bona fide transactions; and documentation of payment 
47 of any tax assessed on the logging equipment pursuant to Title 36, chapter 105.  An 
48 employer shall notify the Maine Department of Labor within 30 14 calendar days of the 
49 date on which a bond worker begins work in the State and shall specify the name of the 
50 bond worker and the anticipated locations where the bond worker will be conducting work 
51 and shall provide a copy of the United States Customs and Border Protection's entry form 
52 for that worker.  The employer shall certify to the Maine Department of Labor that the 
53 employer is not requiring the bond worker to engage in point-to-point hauling of forest 
54 products within the State or to otherwise violate federal cabotage laws.  If the notification 
55 is not provided within 30 14 calendar days of the date on which a bond worker begins work, 
56 a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $25,000 must be assessed against that
