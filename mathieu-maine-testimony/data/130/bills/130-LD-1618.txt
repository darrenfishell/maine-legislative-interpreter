Page 1 - 130LR2036(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the continued increase in the variety of available registration plates has 
4 created logistical complications in the manufacture, storage and administration of 
5 registration plates and imposed a considerable administrative burden on municipalities and 
6 other political subdivisions of the State performing registrations; and
7Whereas, there is an absence of a strategic plan for the growth and usage of 
8 registration plates; and
9Whereas, there is an immediate need to clearly define the role of specialty registration 
10 plates used for fund-raising by government and private entities under the Maine Revised 
11 Statutes, Title 29-A, section 468; and
12Whereas, specialty registration plates could convey messages that are considered 
13 controversial, unfair or not uniformly representative of other points of view; and
