2 Under current law, a winery or small winery located within this State or another state 
3 may obtain a license from the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
4 Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to ship its products directly to 
5 Maine customers.   The bill expands the types of entities eligible to receive licenses from 
6 the bureau for the direct shipment of wine to Maine customers to include retailers licensed 
7 in this State or another state to sell wine for off-premises consumption as well as 
8 wholesalers licensed in this State or another state.  The bill also increases from 12 to 24 the 
9 maximum number of 9-liter cases of wine that may be directly shipped by one entity to any 
10 one recipient address and removes the prohibitions against the direct shipment of containers 
11 of less than 750 milliliters of wine and of products commonly known as "wine coolers."  
12 Finally, the bill removes the provision of current law that exempts from the State's beverage 
13 container redemption law wine that is imported to the State by a licensed direct shipper.2
