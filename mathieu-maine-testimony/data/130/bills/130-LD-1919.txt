32 for:
33 1.  Up to 160 hours of the labor costs for both the new employee and the person training

37 3.  A percentage of Maine income tax withheld for a new employee in the first 3 years 
38 of employment as follows:

2 If a new employee does not work at least 900 hours in the first calendar year of 
3 employment, the partial first year of employment and the calendar year following that 
4 employee's start is considered the first year of employment for purposes of determining the 
5 percentage of reimbursement as long as that employee meets the requirements during the 
6 first full year of employment. Additionally, the costs of training incurred by the employer 
7 and the amount equal to the tax withheld for that new employee during that partial calendar 
8 year of employment may be claimed by the employer in the calendar year following the 
9 employee's start, as long as that employee meets all the requirements for qualification, 
10 including working at least 900 hours.
