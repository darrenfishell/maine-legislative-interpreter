Page 1 - 130LR0805(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §2602-A, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1991, c. 499, §3 and 
3 affected by §26, is further amended to read:
42.  Fees.  The Except as provided in subsection 3, the department shall charge the 
5 average cost of the analysis for an examination, testing or analysis of private residential 
6 water supplies requested under this chapter.  These fees must be recalculated and deposited 
7 according to section 565, subsection 3 and section 568, provided except that the fee charged 
8 for testing a private residential water supply may not exceed $150 when:
9 A.  In the opinion of the department, initial testing or screening performed at the 
10 expense of the owner indicates the need for additional testing at a cost in excess of 
11 $150 to determine whether that water supply contains contaminants potentially 
12 hazardous to human health and that additional testing is essential to the maintenance 
13 of public health; or
14 B.  In the opinion of the department, there is reason to suspect that a private residential 
15 water supply may be affected by contamination potentially hazardous to human health 
16 and that additional testing is essential to the maintenance of public health.  In making 
17 such a determination, the department shall consider the following:
18 (1)  The proximity of the private residential water supply to a known or suspected 
19 source of contamination;
20 (2)  The proximity of the private residential water supply to another private well or 
21 water supply known to be contaminated;
22 (3)  Information provided in writing to the department by a physician who has seen 
23 or treated a person and who has identified contaminated drinking water as a 
24 possible cause of the person's condition or symptoms; or
25 (4)  Information provided by the owner or a user of the private residential water 
26 supply voluntarily or in response to questions asked by personnel of the 
27 department.
28 The department may shall waive all fees incurred in connection with the testing of a private 
29 residential water supply upon a showing of indigency.
30Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §2602-A, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
313.  Well water testing for low-income residents.  The department shall establish and 
32 maintain a program through the Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory established 
33 in section 565 to provide free testing of the private residential water supplies of low-income 
34 residents of the State.  The department may not charge any fee or recover any cost as 
35 otherwise permitted by this chapter for a test of a private residential water supply performed 
36 for a low-income resident of the State under the program established by this subsection.
37Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §2660-U, as amended by PL 2017, c. 475, Pt. C, §7, is further

41 Testing Laboratory established in section 565 shall collect a fee not to exceed $10 from a 
Page 2 - 130LR0805(01)42 person or entity ordering a water test for a water sample from a residential private drinking 
43 water well.  The fees collected must be credited to the Private Well Safe Drinking Water 
44 Fund established in section 2660‑W and used for the purpose of increasing testing of 
45 residential private drinking water wells.  If more than one test of a water sample from the 
46 same residential private drinking water well is conducted, the department may waive 
47 payment of a fee established under this section for a one-year period.  A fee collected under 
48 this section is in addition to any fee charged by the department pursuant to section 2602‑A, 
49 subsection 2.
9Sec. 4.  22 MRSA §2660-W, sub-§3, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 230, §3, is

13 amended to read:
14 C.  To defray the department's costs in administering this subchapter and in waiving 
15 fees under section 2602‑A, subsection subsections 2 . and 3; and
16Sec. 6.  22 MRSA §2660-W, sub-§3, ¶D is enacted to read:
17 D.  To implement the program established pursuant to section 2602-A to provide free 
18 testing of private residential water supplies to low-income residents of the State.
19Sec. 7.  22 MRSA §2660-Y is enacted to read:
20§2660-Y.  Landlord arsenic testing
21 A landlord shall periodically test for arsenic each private drinking water well used to 
22 provide water to a tenant of the landlord.  The landlord shall conduct testing under this 
23 section through a laboratory certified or accredited pursuant to section 567 and shall 
24 promptly provide to each of the landlord's tenants the results of any test conducted under

26 landlord shall promptly notify any new tenant of the most recent results of a test conducted 
27 under this section on a private drinking water well that will be used to provide water to the 
28 tenant.
29Sec. 8.  Maximum contaminant level for arsenic.  The provisions of this section 
30 apply to arsenic testing for community water systems.
311.  Interim maximum contaminant level for arsenic; reporting.  If a test of a 
32 community water system, as defined in Title 22, section 2660-B, subsection 2, conducted 
33 by a laboratory approved pursuant to Title 22, section 2607 detects the presence of arsenic 
34 at or above a concentration of 5 parts per billion, the laboratory shall report to the 
35 department an exceedance of the maximum contaminant level for arsenic in accordance 
36 with 10-144 C.M.R. Chapter 231, Section 6.
372.  Treatment.  If a laboratory reports an exceedance of the maximum contaminant 
38 level for arsenic within a community water system under this section to the department, the 
39 department shall direct the community water system to implement treatments or other 
40 remedies necessary to reduce the contaminant level of arsenic below 5 parts per billion.1

15 This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a program 
16 to provide free well water testing for low-income residents of the State to be conducted by

19 those tests to their tenants.
20 The bill provides that the maximum contaminant level of arsenic that is acceptable in 
21 water for human consumption in a community water system is 5 parts per billion.  The bill 
22 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to consider recent research on the 
23 toxicity of arsenic and the acceptable level of consumption of arsenic and to adopt a rule 
24 to specify the maximum contaminant level of arsenic that is acceptable in water for human 
25 consumption on or before December 31, 2021.15
