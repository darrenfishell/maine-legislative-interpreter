23 immediate danger to the public safety or is reasonably expected to cause significant, 
24 imminent and irreparable public injury.  An emergency cease and desist order is 
25 effective immediately and continues in force and effect until further order of the 
26 commission or until stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In a subsequent

35 issue such orders, preliminary or final, as it considers proper under the facts established 
36 before it.
3713.  Notice to Attorney General.  If the commission has reason to believe that any a 
38 competitive electricity provider, 3rd-party sales agent or transmission and distribution 
39 utility has violated any provision of law for which criminal prosecution is provided and 
40 would be in order or any antitrust law of this State or the United States, the commission 
41 shall notify the Attorney General.  The Attorney General shall promptly institute any 
42 actions or proceedings the Attorney General considers appropriate.
4313-A.  Investigation.  The commission may investigate any matter relating to the 
44 provision of service by a competitive electricity provider or the actions of a 3rd-party sales

46 commission shall use the procedures established under section 1303, subsection 2.

7 charges for standard-offer service provided under section 3212.
815.  Standard billing.  The commission shall consider requiring standard billing 
9 information on bills for electric power service.  If standard billing information is required,

16 commission shall provide load data on a class basis that is in the possession of a 
17 transmission and distribution utility, subject to reasonable protective orders to protect 
18 confidentiality, if considered necessary by the commission.
1916-A.  Customer information.  A transmission and distribution utility may not release 
20 any customer-specific information to a licensed competitive electricity provider unless the 
21 provider produces sufficient evidence, as defined by the commission by rule, that the 
22 provider has obtained the customer's authorization.
2317.  Rules.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, rules adopted pursuant to this 
24 section are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter II-A  2-A.
2518.  Confidentiality of consumer information.  Information concerning customers of 
26 a competitive electricity provider or a 3rd-party sales agent is subject to the same 
27 confidentiality protections afforded utility customer information under section 704, 
28 subsection 5.
29SUMMARY
30 This bill establishes requirements for and places certain limitations and penalties on 
31 3rd-party sales agents, defined as a person or entity that is not an employee of a competitive 
32 electricity provider but has a business relationship with a competitive electricity provider 
33 in which the person or entity conducts or arranges to conduct sales of electricity to the 
34 public at retail on behalf of the competitive electricity provider through direct contact 
35 accomplished by means of a personal visit to the consumer, other than at the 3rd-party sales 
36 agent's place of business, without the consumer soliciting the initial contact.  The bill 
37 requires 3rd-party sales agents to register with the Public Utilities Commission and to 
38 comply with the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act and other federal and state laws and 
39 rules regarding door-to-door sales.  The bill prohibits a 3rd-party sales agent from entering 
40 into an agreement to provide service to a residential consumer when that service is solicited 
41 using door-to-door sales practices without providing the residential consumer a standard 
42 disclosure form that meets requirements prescribed by the commission by rule. The bill 
43 prohibits a competitive electricity provider or a 3rd-party sales agent from representing 
44 itself as an alternative to a transmission and distribution utility.1
