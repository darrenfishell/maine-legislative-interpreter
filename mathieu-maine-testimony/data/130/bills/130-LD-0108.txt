12SUMMARY
13 This bill repeals the law restricting the use of single-use carry-out plastic bags by retail 
14 stores and instead allows a retailer to use plastic bags to bag products at the point of retail 
15 sale if the retailer locates inside the store or within 20 feet of the main entrance to the store 
16 a receptacle for collecting any used plastic bags and ensures that the plastic bags collected 
17 are recycled or delivered to a person engaged in recycling plastics.
18 The purpose of this repeal is to allow the use of single-use bags instead of reusable 
19 bags and prevent the spread of disease that may exist on reusable bags.
