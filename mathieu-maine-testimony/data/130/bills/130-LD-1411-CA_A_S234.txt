SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, raises the dollar value 
of a manufactured good to $5,000 per item or per purchase order. It removes the 
opportunity for in-state contractors to submit a matching bid price and replaces it with a 
10% preference applied in a manner consistent with rules adopted by the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services. The amendment also adds an appropriations and 
allocations section.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Requiring all procurement bids and subsequent contracts to contain a provision that the manufactured goods be 
manufactured in the United States could increase costs to all state agencies and public higher educational institutions 
if contracted goods are less expensive than those manufactured in the United States and a waiver is not granted. This 
provision does not apply to the Department of Transportation's construction contracts. The Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) has indicated it will require additional positions to research which 
products are manufactured in the United States, to review all contracts and to implement and enforce the waiver 
process. The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $252,784 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $260,873 in fiscal year 
2022-23 for 2 Planning and Research Associate I positions and 2 Procurement Analyst I positions.
