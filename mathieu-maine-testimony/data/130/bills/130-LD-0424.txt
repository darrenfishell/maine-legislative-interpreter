3 further amended to read:
41.  Policies subject to this section.  This section applies to all individual, group and 
5 blanket medical insurance policies except hospital indemnity, specified accident, specified 
6 disease, long-term care and short-term, limited-duration policies issued by insurers or

14 B.  An insurer or the insurer's agent or broker may not issue a short-term, 
15 limited‑duration policy that replaces a prior short-term, limited‑duration policy as long 
16 as if the combined term of the new policy and all prior successive policies  does not 
17 exceed exceeds 24 months  and the individual has not been covered under any prior 
18 short-term, limited-duration policy for at least 12 months.  All individuals making an

30SUMMARY
31 This bill reverses several changes regulating short-term, limited-duration health 
32 insurance policies enacted in Public Law 2019, chapter 330.  The bill authorizes the 
33 issuance of a policy for up to 12 months and eliminates the restriction terminating a 
34 short-term, limited-duration policy on December 31st of the year in which it is issued.  The 
35 bill removes the prohibition on selling a short-term, limited-duration policy to anyone who 
36 has had prior short-term policy coverage in the last 12 months and removes the combined 
37 cap on coverage of 24 months.  The bill also removes the requirement that these policies 
38 may be sold only through an in-person encounter and the provision prohibiting the sale of 
39 these policies during any open enrollment period.
40 The changes made in the bill apply to short-term, limited-duration health insurance 
41 policies, contracts and certificates issued or renewed in this State on or after January 1, 
42 2022.
