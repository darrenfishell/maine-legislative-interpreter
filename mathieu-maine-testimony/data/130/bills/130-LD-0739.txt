Page 1 - 130LR0992(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง1714-E, sub-ยง4, as reallocated by RR 2011, c. 2, ยง25, is 
3 amended to read:
44.  Final determination; offset.  Upon a final determination that fraud has occurred  
5 an allegation of fraud has been established and that money is owed by the MaineCare 
6 provider to the department, and 31 21 days after exhaustion of all administrative appeals  
7 and any judicial review available under Title 5, chapter 375, the department may retain and 
8 apply as an offset to amounts determined to be owed to the department any payments to 
9 the provider that were suspended by the department pursuant to this section. The amount 
10 retained pursuant to this subsection may not exceed the amount determined finally to be 
11 owed.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill allows the Department of Health and Human Services, after a final 
14 determination that an allegation of fraud concerning a MaineCare provider has been 
15 established, rather than that fraud has occurred, to retain and apply as an offset to amounts 
16 determined to be owed to the department any payments to the provider that were suspended 
17 by the department.  This bill also decreases from 31 days to 21 days after exhaustion of all 
18 administrative appeals when the department may take that action and removes reference to 
19 judicial review.
