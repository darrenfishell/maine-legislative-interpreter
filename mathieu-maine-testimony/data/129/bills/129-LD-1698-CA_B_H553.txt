Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill provides an income tax credit for the production of renewable chemicals by the conversion of renewable 
biomass from the forest, farms, the sea or solid waste and would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of 
$19,000 in fiscal year 2021-22. It would also result in a reduction in Local Government Fund revenue of $1,000 in 
fiscal year 2021-22. 
Additional costs to the Department of Economic and Community Development to implement the requirements of this 
legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
