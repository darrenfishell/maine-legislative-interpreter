Committee: Education and Cultural Affairs 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Schools already, in compliance 
This bill prohibits local school administrative units, the University of Maine System, the Maine Community College 
System and the Maine Maritime Academy from having or adopting a name, symbol or image that depicts or refers to a 
Native American tribe, individual, custom or tradition as a mascot, nickname, logo or team name of the school. 
Because the school board representing the last public school in Maine that had been using a Native American mascot 
voted in early March of this year to stop using the Native American as a mascot, this bill does not require local units 
of government to expend local revenues to comply. There'. is no fiscal impact on the University of Maine System, the 
Maine Community College System or the Maine Maritim~ Academy.
