9SUMMARY
10This bill contains the following provisions.
111.  In Part A it amends the crime of endangering the welfare of a child by enacting in 
12the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph D a new 
13Class C crime for the reckless violation of a duty of care or protection that results in death 
14or serious bodily injury to the child.  It amends the crime of endangering the welfare of a 
15child under Title 17-A, section 554, subsection 1, paragraph C to cover recklessly 
16violating a duty of care or protection.
172.  In Part B it amends the crime of gross sexual assault against a person under 12 
18years of age or under 14 years of age, both of which are Class A crimes, by requiring that 
19the actor be at least 3 years older than the other person.
203.  In Part C it amends Title 15, section 393 to recognize that convictions in the tribal 
21courts of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation are disqualifying domestic 
22violence convictions for the purposes of the prohibition against firearms created by Title 
2315, section 393, subsection 1-B.  It makes Title 15, section 393 more consistent with the 
24Maine Criminal Code by using the phrase "another jurisdiction" to reference the courts 
25defined by that term.
264.  In Part D, in response to State v. LeBlanc-Simpson, 2018 ME 109, it clarifies that 
27a judicial officer in issuing a written release order under Title 15, section 1026, 
28subsection 2-A or 3 must inform a defendant of the conditions of release, that the 
29conditions take effect and are fully enforceable immediately and that failure to appear or 
30comply with conditions may result in revocation of bail and additional criminal penalties.  
31The bill provides that a condition of release takes effect and is fully enforceable 
32immediately as of the time the judicial officer sets the condition, unless the bail order 
33expressly excludes a condition of release from immediate applicability, if the defendant is 
34advised of the conditions and that failure to appear or comply with the conditions may 
35subject the defendant to revocation of bail and additional criminal penalties.
365.  In Part E it amends the probation statutes to reflect the current practice of the 
37Department of Corrections with respect to calculating the period of probation.  A 
38probationer receives credit for a full day of probation on the day probation commences, 
Page 7 - 129LR0228(01)-11regardless of the time of day, and receives no credit for a day on which probation is 
2tolled.  The period of probation ends when the final day of the probation period ends.
