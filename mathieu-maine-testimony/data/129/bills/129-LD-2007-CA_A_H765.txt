base reinsurance premium rates, subject to approval of the superintendent, set at levels

22 section number to read consecutively. 
23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
25 1. It specifies that the reporting to the Legislature on the operations of the Maine 
26 Health Insurance Marketplace is to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
27 jurisdiction over health coverage, insurance and financial services matters. 
28 2. It adds cross-references to the definitions of "individual health plan" and "small 
29 group health plan" to clarify that the requirements for the pooled market do not extend to 
30 certain limited benefit insurance plans. 
31 3. It clarifies the intent that a health plan in the pooled market must comply with the 
32 requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, chapter 56-A. 
33 4. It clarifies that the pooled market does not change current law allowing carriers to 
34 limit their operations to a designated service area or to offer different plans within 
35 different service areas. 
36 5. It clarifies that the 11average premium" trigger is not intended to allow the pooled 
37 market to go forward merely on a finding that average premiums for the pooled group 
38 will be lower, if savings for nongroup policyholders come at the expense of increased 
39 costs for small business. It also adds language requiring the Superintendent of Insurance

30 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1425, L.D. 2007 
to conduct an analysis of alternative proposals to stabilize the small group market, should 
the pooled market not be implemented. 
6. It clarifies that the Superintendent of Insurance is required to develop at least one 
clear choice design plan for each tier and allows carriers to offer up to 3 alternative plans 
subject to submission of a satisfactory actuarial certification to the Superintendent of 
Insurance. 
7. It allows the Maine Guaranteed Access Reinsurance Association the option to 
continue to charge a ceding premium even after converting to a retrospective program. 
8. It clarifies that the Maine Guaranteed Access Reinsurance Association is not 
required to transition to a retrospective reinsurance model in 2022 if the pooled market is 
not in effect. It does provide the option that the association may elect to move to a 
retrospective model regardless of the pooled market, subject to approval by the 
Superintendent of Insurance. 
9. It affirms that the reinsurance program is contingent on federal approval, which is 
an important technical distinction, in order for the program to generate pass-through 
funding. 
10. It limits the scope of the primary care and behavioral health benefit to the 
individual, small group and future pooled markets and corrects an error that inadvertently 
made it applicable to large group plans. It clarifies the intent of the bill to apply the 
primary health services requirement to a total of 6 visits, 3 primary care visits and 3 
behavioral health visits, and further requires that copays for the 2nd and 3rd primary care 
and behavioral health visits must count toward the enrollee's deductible. It adds the word 
"office" after "behavioral health" for clarity. It requires the Superintendent of Insurance 
to analyze the effects of the primary health services requirement on premiums following 
implementation and authorizes the superintendent to adopt rules to address the 
coordination of the requirements for coverage without cost sharing for the first primary 
care visit and the requirements with respect to coverage of an annual well visit. 
11. It adds an appropriations and allocations section.
