28SUMMARY
29This bill exempts from Maine income tax certain income from out-of-state pensions 
30in order to avoid double taxation of that income.  The exemption is only for the amount of 
31the contribution made by the taxpayer divided by the life expectancy of the taxpayer and 
32applies only if the income is included in federal adjusted gross income and not deducted 
33under the general pension deduction.
34In order to qualify for the exemption, the contribution must have been made using 
35income on which income tax was paid and is available only if the state in which the 
36taxpayer resided at the time of the contribution provides a similar exemption to a former 
37resident of Maine.
