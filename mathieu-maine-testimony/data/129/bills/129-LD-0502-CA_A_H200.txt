This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $243,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 to a newly created Summer 
Success Pilot Program Fund within the Department of Education to provide grants to school administrative units 
(SAU's) for 90% of the cost of the pilot program. The estimated annual cost of the pilot program provided by the 
Department of Education is based on the assumption that one SAU in each of the 9 superintendent regions in the State 
will participate in the pilot program at a cost of$27,000 per SAU ($30,000 x 90%). The cost-per-region assumes the 
need for 3 teachers for 4 half-day sessions with 30 children participating. The estimate also includes transportation 
costs. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to establish and administer the program can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
