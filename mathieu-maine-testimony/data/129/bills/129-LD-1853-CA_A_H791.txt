17section number to read consecutively.
18SUMMARY
19This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment establishes requirements for and 
20places certain limitations and penalties on 3rd-party sales agents, defined as a person or 
21entity that is not an employee of a competitive electricity provider but has a business 
22relationship with a competitive electricity provider in which the person or entity conducts 
23or arranges to conduct sales of electricity to the public at retail on behalf of the 
24competitive electricity provider through direct contact accomplished by means of a 
25personal visit to the consumer, other than at the 3rd-party sales agent's place of business, 
26without the consumer soliciting the initial contact.  The amendment requires 3rd-party 
27sales agents to register with the Public Utilities Commission and to comply with the 
28Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act and other federal and state laws and rules regarding 
29door-to-door sales.  The amendment prohibits a 3rd-party sales agent from entering into 
30an agreement to provide service to a residential consumer when that service is solicited 
31using door-to-door sales practices without providing the residential consumer a standard 
32disclosure form that meets requirements prescribed by the commission by rule. The 
33amendment prohibits a competitive electricity provider or a 3rd-party sales agent from 
34representing itself as an alternative to a transmission and distribution utility.
