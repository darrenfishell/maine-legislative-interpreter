Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill states the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) may enter into contracts with organizations 
representing individuals with a brain injury and their families, bringing together state and national expertise to provide 
core brain injury support for underserved populations of individuals with an acquired brain injury. These new 
contracts, if entered into by the DHHS, must be provided within the limits of available DHHS resources, so no new 
appropriations will be made to the DHHS. However, any new contracts will reduce the resources of the DHHS which 
could lead to other cul'l'ent services receiving less funding.
