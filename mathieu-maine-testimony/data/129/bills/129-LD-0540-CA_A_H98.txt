HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "!),, to H.P. 397, L.D. 540, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Qualifications for District Attorneys" 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 2 (page 1, lines 5 to 10 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'2. Qualifications. Only attorneys admitted to the general praetiee of law in this an 
attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the State and who reside resides 
in the prosecutorial district may be elected or appointed district attorney. Removal from 
the prosecutorial district or disbarment or suspension from the practice of law vacates the 
office. For purposes of this subsection, a person is a "member in good standing of the bar 
of the State" if that person is admitted to the practice of law in this State, is presently 
registered with the Board of Overseers of the Bar as an active practitioner and is not 
currently disbarred or suspended from practice in this State pursuant to Title 4. chapter 
17. subchapter 2 or the Maine Bar Rules.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
The bill provides for the disqualification of a person to be elected or appointed 
district attorney if the person has been suspended from the practice of law within the 
previous 10 years. It also provides thi:tt disbarment or suspension during the term of 
office results in the person vacating the office; this amendment retains this provision. 
This amendment requires a district attorney to be a "member in good standing of the 
bar of the State, 11 which is consistent with the generally accepted standard of qualification 
of attorneys for positions. Language from the law governing qualifications for the 
Attorney General is added to the law governing qualifications for a district attorney to 
make these provisions consistent. The atnendment does not require a waiting period after 
a suspension.
