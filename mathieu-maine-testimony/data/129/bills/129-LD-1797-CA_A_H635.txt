Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill repeals provisions in current law that directed the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of 
Public Safety to award one entity through a competitive bidding process a license to conduct advance deposit 
wagering and instead allows commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities and multijurisdictional account wagering 
providers to be licensed to participate in advance deposit wagering. Advance deposit wagering licensees are directed 
to remit 4% of their gross advance deposit wagering income to the GCU for distribution as follows: 
Credited to the General Fund 
Fund to Stabilize Off-Track Betting Facilities (OSR) 
Sire Stakes Fund (OSR) 
Agricultural Fair Support Fund (OSR)

The State's share of the advance deposit wagering in fiscal year 2019-20 is anticipated to generate only $2400 in 
revenue of which $240 will be credited to the General Fund and $2,160 will be distributed into the various Other 
Special Revenue Funds accounts listed above. In fiscal year 2020-21, General Fund revenue is estimated to be $252 
and Other Special Revenue Funds revenue is estimated to be $2,268. Corresponding Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocations are included to allow for the expenditure of the funds. 
License and application fees are estimated to generate $22,500 in fiscal year 2019-20 with additional revenue in 
fiscal year 2024-25 when the 5-year licenses are renewed. License fee revenue assumes that five off-track betting 
facilities and 10 multijurisdictional account wagering providers will seek licensure. This bill also includes 
appropriations to the GCU of$93,046 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $127,628 in fiscal year 2020-21 for one Public 
Safety Manager II position and associated All Other costs.
