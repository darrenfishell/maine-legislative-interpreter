Page 2 - 129LR1878(01)-11account wagering provider may receive a license from the board to conduct advance 
2deposit wagering in this State, including accepting deposits and wagers from account 
3holders.  The board shall require a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000 and an 
4applicant must pay the costs of the board for processing an application and performing 
5background investigations.  A license issued pursuant to this section authorizes the 
6licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering for a period of 5 years.  The fee for a 
7license to conduct advance deposit wagering is $500.  The renewal fee for a license to 
8conduct advance deposit wagering is $250.  A licensee shall purchase a bond to secure 
9the accounts of advance deposit wagering bettors.  A licensee shall use a system to 
10conduct advance deposit wagering to ensure that bettors who establish accounts to place 
11bets on horse racing via advance deposit wagering are 18 years of age or older and 
12residents of the State.  Advance deposit wagering may be conducted directly by an 
13advance deposit wagering licensee or through such a licensee entering into a contract 
14with a provider of advance deposit wagering services located within the United States.
15An advance deposit wagering licensee may accept a wager from an advance deposit 
16wagering account holder in person or by telephone, Internet, mobile device, electronic 
17communication or, if approved by the board, other electronic media.  If permitted by an 
18off-track betting facility or a commercial track, an advance deposit wagering account 
19holder may access the account holder's account at such locations so that a wager using an 
20advance deposit wagering account is treated as if the wager had been made at the 
21commercial track or off-track betting facility.
22SUMMARY
23This bill allows commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities and multijurisdictional 
24account wagering providers to be licensed to participate in advance deposit wagering.  It 
25repeals the provision that directs the Department of Public Safety, Gambling Control 
26Board, through a competitive bidding process, to award one bidder the privilege to be 
27licensed to conduct advance deposit wagering.  It requires the board to establish by rule 
28the net commission that must be collected by a licensee for distribution by the board.
