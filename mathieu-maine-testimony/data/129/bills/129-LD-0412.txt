7SUMMARY
8Current law requires that, beginning in fiscal year 2018-19, a portion of the system 
9administration allocation must be allocated to school administrative units that have 
10established regionalized administrative services.  This bill instead establishes the system 
11administration allocation at $135 per pupil, the same as it was for fiscal year 2017-18, 
12and repeals provisions that increase for future fiscal years the per-pupil amount and 
13restrict allocation of portions of the funds to school administrative units that have 
14established regionalized administrative services.
