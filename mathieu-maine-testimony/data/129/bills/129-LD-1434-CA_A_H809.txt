9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to H.P. 1044, L.D. 1434, “An Act To Allow 
10 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists To Bill for Their Services”
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
12 following:
13 'Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4320-P is enacted to read:
14§4320-P.  Coverage for services provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist
151.  Services provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist.  A carrier offering 
16 a health plan in this State shall provide coverage for health care services performed by a 
17 certified registered nurse anesthetist licensed under Title 32, chapter 31 when those services 
18 are covered services under the health plan when performed by any other health care 
19 provider and when those services are within the lawful scope of practice of the certified 
20 registered nurse anesthetist.
212.  Limits; deductible; copayment; coinsurance.  A carrier may offer a health plan 
22 containing a provision for a deductible, copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health 
23 care service provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist as long as the deductible, 
24 copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance 
25 applicable to the same service provided by other health care providers. 
263.  Network participation.  A carrier may not prohibit a certified registered nurse 
27 anesthetist from participating in the carrier's provider network or billing the carrier directly 
28 solely because the provider is a certified registered nurse anesthetist as long as the provider 
29 is willing to meet the same terms and conditions as other participating providers. This 
30 subsection does not require a carrier to contract with all certified registered nurse 
31 anesthetists or require a carrier to provide coverage under a health plan for any service 
32 provided by a participating certified registered nurse anesthetist that is not a covered service 
33 under the plan.
344.  Claim submission.  Services billed by a certified registered nurse anesthetist must 
35 be submitted using the current standardized claim form for professional services approved 
36 by the Federal Government and submitted electronically.
