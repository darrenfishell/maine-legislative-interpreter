Sec. 2. Maine Revised Statutes headnote enacted; revision clause. In the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, chapter 15, after the chapter headnote, the headnote 
"subchapter 1, children's mental health program" is enacted and the Revisor of Statutes 
shall implement this revision when updating, publishing or republishing the statutes. 
Sec. 3. Early childhood consultation program. By September 1, 2020, the 
Department of Health and Human Services shall develop, establish and implement an 
early childhood consultation program under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, 
chapter 15, subchapter 2, referred to in this section as "the program," to enable trained 
consultants with expertise in the areas of early childhood development and mental health 
to work on-site with early care and education teachers and providers working with 
children to aid them in the use of low-cost or no-cost evidence-based strategies that 
reduce challenging behaviors in children and promote social-emotional growth; to 
provide guidance to parents about effective ways to address their children's behavioral 
difficulties; and to connect children and families to programs, resources and supports that 
will assist them in their development and success, while addressing barriers to accessing 
these resources and supports. The department shall design the program in consultation 
with the national Center of Excellence for Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health 
Consultation, a project funded by the United States Department of Health and Human 
Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Children's 
Cabinet established in Title 5, chapter 439 and key stakeholders in the State, including 
mental health professionals delivering mental health consultation within the State. In 
developing the program, the department shall: 
1. Develop standards and guidelines to ensure that the program is implemented with 
primary consideration given to the core elements of evidence-based services as adapted 
for the State's unique rural character. The guidelines must include effective strengths­
based strategies and plans that support children's success across learning environments. 
The standards must include knowledge of research-informed infant and early childhood 
mental health practices, family circumstances that affect children's behavior and mental 
health, developmental science and milestones, mental health, trauma-informed 
approaches, adverse childhood experiences, sensory processing issues, poverty, disability 
and community supports, resources and services available to a child and the child's family 
to alleviate family stress; 
2. Explore enhancing cross-sector professional development capacity in the State 
through partnerships with entities such as the national Center of Excellence for Infant and 
Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation; 
3. Develop and implement a plan for consultants to provide individualized on-site 
coaching as requested by teachers, caregivers and families. The plan may include 
professional development in the form of group training and communities of practice that 
include professionals, such as home visitors or child welfare staff, who work with young 
children and families. The plan must reinforce and extend the supports provided by early 
childhood mental health consultants to people providing professional development in 
early childhood and public school settings; 
4. Develop a system for collecting and analyzing implementation data and selected 
outcomes to identify areas for improvement, promote accountability and provide 
continuous quality improvement and service delivery to improve child outcomes by
