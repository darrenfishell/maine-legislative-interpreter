25advance review and prior approval of individual health insurance rates.  It requires the 
26Superintendent of Insurance to hold a hearing if a filing proposes an increase in rates in 
27individual health insurance plans.  It requires the Superintendent of Insurance to

29requirements for individual health plans.  The changes apply to individual health plan rate 
30filings submitted to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of 
31Insurance beginning with the 2022 plan or policy year.

33insurance plans to reduce the rating band for age and to require that the ratio on the basis 
34of geographic area is 1.5 to 1 and that the ratio for age and geographic area may not 
35exceed 2.5.  These changes reinstate the rating provisions in place before the enactment 
36of Public Law 2011, chapter 90. Part B also prohibits the use of tobacco as a rating factor.  
37The changes apply to all individual and small group policies issued or renewed on or after
