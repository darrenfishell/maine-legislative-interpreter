This amendment eliminates the ongoing General Fund appropriations in the bill of $500,000 per year beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20 to the School Finance and Operations program within the Department of Education to provide 
funding to those school administrative units that start or expand alternative breakfast delivery services that provide 
breakfast after the start of the school day. A "one-time" nonlapsing General Fund appropriation of $500,000 in fiscal 
year 2019-20 was already provided in Public Law 2019, chapter 480 (LD 701) for this purpose.
