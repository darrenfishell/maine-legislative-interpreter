12SUMMARY
13 This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.
14 This amendment replaces the bill.  The amendment requires court authorization for the 
15 Department of Health and Human Services to release confidential information related to 
16 child protective activities to an administrator of a social media service to report, investigate 
17 or remove a threat or serious intimidation attempt directed at a department employee, an 
18 employee of the Attorney General's Office, a guardian ad litem, a court employee or an 
19 officer of the court, including prosecuting and other attorneys.
20 The amendment defines "social media service" and prohibits the social media service 
21 from redisclosing the confidential information that is provided by the department.
22 This amendment differs from the majority report by requiring the department to 
23 disclose confidential information to a law enforcement agency, to the extent necessary for 
24 reporting, investigating or removing a threat or serious intimidation attempt directed 
25 against an employee of the department, an employee of the Attorney General's Office, a 
26 guardian ad litem or an employee or officer of any court or court system.

additional funding at this time.  The collection of additional filing fees may increase Ge neral Fund and other dedicated revenue by minor amounts.
