Page 1 - 129LR0403(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3209-A, as corrected by RR 2017, c. 1, §32, is amended to 
3read:
4§3209-A.  Net energy billing
5The commission may shall adopt or amend rules governing net energy billing.  Rules 
6adopted or amended pursuant to this section must allow up to 200 customers to share 
7ownership of an electricity generating facility under net energy billing; must allow 
8electricity generating facilities of up to one megawatt installed capacity to qualify for net 
9energy billing; and must require the commission to review net energy billing when the 
10cumulative capacity of electricity generating facilities that participate in net energy 
11billing in the service territory of a transmission and distribution utility reaches 10% of the 
12utility's peak demand.  Rules adopted or amended under this section are routine technical 
13rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  "Net energy billing" means a 
14billing and metering practice under which a customer is billed on the basis of net energy 
15over the billing period taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt-hour credits from 
16the previous billing period.
17Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§2, ¶B-3, as amended by PL 2015, c. 220, §1, is 
18further amended to read:
19B-3.  "Renewable capacity resource" means a source of electrical generation:
20(1)  Whose total power production capacity does not exceed 100 megawatts and 
21relies on one or more of the following:
22(a)  Fuel cells;

24(c)  Solar arrays and installations;
25(d)  Geothermal installations;
26(e)  Hydroelectric generators that meet all state and federal fish passage 
27requirements applicable to the generator;
28(f)  Biomass generators that are fueled by wood, wood waste or landfill gas;

34greater than or equal to 25 megawatts, that meet all state and federal fish passage 
35requirements applicable to the generator and that are highly productive, as 
36defined by the commission by rule.
37Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§2, ¶B-4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 413, §1, is

4electricity generated by pilot program participants.  In determining the rate or tariff, the 
5commission shall consider whether capacity associated with the energy is included in the 
6program, and rate or tariff, or stays with the pilot program participant. 
73. The commission shall implement the pilot program no later than January 1, 2020. 
8The commission shall evaluate the pilot program and report its findings and 
9recommendations to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
10over energy matters no later than April 15, 2023.  The committee may submit a bill 
11related to the pilot program to the First Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.
12SUMMARY
13This bill does the following.
141. It increases the portfolio requirement for new renewable resources from 10% to 
1550% by 2030 and makes several changes to resource eligibility for the requirement to 
16encourage solar generation and highly productive hydropower resources and to provide 
17minimum efficiency standards for biomass resources.
182. It directs the Public Utilities Commission to procure long-term contracts over a 5-
19year period for 800 megawatts of grid-scale renewable resources, 90 megawatts of 
20community-based renewable resources and 135 megawatts of renewable resources owned 
21by commercial and industrial electricity customers.  For each of these 3 types of 
22renewable resources, the bill requires the commission to conduct annual solicitations for 
23the long-term contracts and specifies requirements for the procurement process, resulting 
24contracts and resource qualification.
253. It requires that the Public Utilities Commission rules governing net energy billing 
26allow up to 200 customers to share ownership of an electricity generating facility for net 
27energy billing, allow electricity generating facilities of up to one megawatt installed 
28capacity to qualify for net energy billing and require the commission to review net energy 
29billing when the cumulative capacity of electricity generating facilities that participate in 
30net energy billing in the service territory of a transmission and distribution utility reaches 
3110% of the utility's peak demand.
324. It directs the Public Utilities Commission to develop a plan for implementing a 
33thermal renewable resource portfolio standard to encourage commercial and industrial 
34pellet and wood heating systems, residential biomass systems and combined heat and 
35power systems fueled by biomass.  It requires the commission to submit a plan for the 
36thermal renewable resource portfolio standard by January 1, 2020.
375. It directs the Public Utilities Commission to develop, implement and evaluate a 
38distributed generation pilot program to encourage on-site renewable energy generation. It 
39requires the commission to evaluate the pilot program after 3 years of operation and 
Page 7 - 129LR0403(01)-11report its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the 
2Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters by April 15, 2023.
