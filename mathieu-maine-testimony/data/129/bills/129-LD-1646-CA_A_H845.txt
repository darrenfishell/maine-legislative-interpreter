Legislative Cost/Study
Fiscal Detail and Notes129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
Any costs resulting from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) initiating an inquiry related to notification of 
authorized entities of any proposed sale of an investor-own ed transmission and distribution utility and to provide the 
opportunity to bid on the sale are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.  
The PUC has indicated that a second inqui ry regarding a process or pilot progra m to finance capital investment in and 
ownership of new transmission and distribution plant by a least-cost capita l provider and to compensate transmission 
and distribution utilities for certain planning, building, maintaining and operating activities of a new plant would 
require specialized consulting assistance to provide a comple te and comprehensive report in time for consideration in 
the next legislative session. No estimate of these costs is made at this time. Without this consulting assistance the 
PUC can only solicit public comments on the issues and prov ide a report that discusses the comments received and 
the questions raised. 
Additional costs to the Office of the State Treasurer and th e PUC associated with providing assistance to the task 
force can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Th e additional cost to the Finance Authority of Maine to 
provide the task force with insight and/or information on financing, if requested, can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.  Fiscal NoteAn Act To Restore Local Ownership and Control of Maine's Power Delivery Systems

Legislative Cost/Study
Current biennium cost increas e - Other Special Revenue Funds
The general operating expenses of this study/task force are projected to be $1,695 in  fiscal year 2020-21 and $1,218 
in fiscal year 2021-22. An estimated $6,190 is available in fiscal year 2020-21 in the Legislature's budget for 
legislative studies as well as balances from prior years fo r this purpose. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund 
all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature The task 
force is authorized to contract for staffing, consulting or other services to complete its work.  Whether or not these 
costs will be incurred will depend on the total amount of funds received by the task force and accepted by the Legislative Council.  This fiscal estimate assumes the agencies listed in subsection 7 will provide staff support in the absence of additional funding beyond the funding needed to reimburse legislative members for their attendance.
