8 FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "ft" to S.P. 291, L.D. 1012, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Provide Stable Funding and Support for Child Care Providers" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following: 
12 'Sec. 2. 22 MRSA §3737, sub-§3, as corrected by RR 2015, c. 1, §21, is amended 
13 to read: 
14 3. Quality differential. To the extent permitted by federal law, the department shall 
15 pay a differential rate for child care services that meet or that make substantial progress 
16 toward meeting nationally recognized quality standards, such as those standards required 
17 by the Head Start program or required for accreditation by the National Association for 
18 the Education of Young Children, and shall do so from the Child Care Development Fund 
19 25% Quality Set-aside funds or by other acceptable federal practices. Rules adopted 
20 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, 
21 subchapter 2-A. The rules must establish a 4-step child care quality rating system and 
22 must provide for graduated quality differential rates for step 2, step 3 and step 4 child 
23 care services. 
24 Nothing in this subsection requires the department to pay a quality differential rate for 
25 child care services provided through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block 
26 grant. Nothing in this subsection prohibits the department from using state funds to pay a 
27 quality differential rate for child care services. 
28 Sec. 3. 22 MRSA §3737, sub-§3-A is enacted to read: 
29 3-A. Graduated quality differential rates. The graduated quality differential rates 
30 that the department is required to pay for child care services under subsection 3 include: 
31 A. Five percent for step 2 child care services other than for infants or 25% for step 2 
32 child care services for infants; 
33 B. Ten percent for step 3 child care services other than for infants or 30% for step 3 
34 child care services for infants; and

2 4 child care services for infants.' 
3 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 4 and inserting the following: 
4 'Sec. 4. 22 MRSA §3737, sub-§§5 and 6 are enacted to read: 
5 5. Use of contracts to improve supply of care for infants, toddlers and preschool 
6 children. The department may use up to 25% of funding received each year from the 
7 child care and development block grant authorized under the federal Child Care and 
8 Development Block Grant Act of 1990 for providing child care services for contracts 
9 with providers of child care services at step 3 and step 4 under subsection 3 to increase 
10 the availability of care for infants, toddlers and preschool children up to 4 years of age. 
11 The contracts must prioritize continuity of care and stable settings for infants, toddlers 
12 and preschool children up to 4 years of age but may support children in another age 
13 group. To qualify for a contract, a provider of child care services under this subsection 
14 must have appropriate training in child development, child trauma, adverse childhood 
15 experience, child protective services and working with children with disabilities. The 
16 department shall ensure that any contracts issued are granted to providers of child care 
17 services under this subsection that prioritize the following at-risk populations: 
18 A. Infants, toddlers and preschool children up to 4 years of age receiving or who 
19 have received child protective services; 
20 B. Infants with disabilities or those referred by the Child Development Services 
21 System as defined in Title 20-A, section 7001, subsection 1-A; 
22 C. Infants whose parents are participating in a substance use disorder treatment 
23 program; 
24 D. Infants whose parents are or have been homeless in the preceding 6 months; and 
25 E. Infants in geographic areas of the State where parents have few opportunities to 
26 secure high-quality infant care. 
27 The department shall submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the 
28 Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters no later than 
29 January 1st of each year, beginning in 2021, describing the use of contracts pursuant to 
30 this subsection. The report must include the number of contracts, the percentage of block 
31 grant funding used for the contracts and the number, grouped by paragraphs A to E, of at-
32 risk children. 
33 6. Shared services. The department may create a program to support providers of 
34 child care services in sharing administrative and program services and costs to make the 
35 providers more efficient and fmancially sustainable and to improve the providers' ability 
36 to deliver high-quality child care services. 
37 Sec. 5. Appropriations and allocations. The following appropriations and 
38 allocations are made.

10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment, which is the majority report, lowers the increases to graduated 
12 quality differential rates for child care services for children other than infants from the 
13 bill. It also clarifies that the Department of Health and Human Services may use state 
14 funds to pay a quality differential rate for high-quality child care services if it chooses to 
15 do so. It allows the Department of Health and Human Services to use up to 25% of the 
16 State's federal child care and development block grant funding for contracts for high-
17 quality child care to underserved children and areas of the State rather than requiring use 
18 of funding for contracts. The department is required to submit an annual report to the 
19 joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human 
20 services matters on the number of contracts, the percentage of block grant funding used 
21 for the contracts and the number of children served. It allows, rather than requires as in 
22 the bill, the department to develop a shared services program.
