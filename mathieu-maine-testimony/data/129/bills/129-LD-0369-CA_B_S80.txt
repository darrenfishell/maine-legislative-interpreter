Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the couit system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any penalty assessed by the Department of Labor pursuant to section 63 7, subsection 9 of this Act accrnes to the 
General Fund. No estimate of these penalties can be made at this time. Additional costs to the Department of Labor to 
enforce the requirements of this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Some providers of Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) services are paid through a cost-settlement 
process. If those providers do not currently provide earned paid sick leave, their costs could increase due to this 
proposal. If the providers' costs increase, then DHHS would also have an increase in the amount paid to those 
providers. It is not known how many cost-settled providers are currently paying earned paid sick leave or what the 
increased cost would be, but DHHS expects any additional costs to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
