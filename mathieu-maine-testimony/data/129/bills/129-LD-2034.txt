23filing a separate petition if the minor asserts good cause.  A change of a minor's name

9cause.  The court may change a minor's name by agreement of all the parties without a 
10determination of good cause.

20E.  Whether the minor is known by a particular name in the community;
21F.  The difficulties, harassment or embarrassment that the minor may experience by 
22bearing the current or proposed name; and
23G.  Any other factor the court considers relevant, including the factors outlined in 
24Title 19-A, section 1653, subsection 3.
253.  Record.  The judge court shall make and preserve a record of a name change.  If 
26the judge court limited the notice required under subsection 2 or 2-A, the judge court may 
27seal the record of the name change.
284.  Filing fee.  The fee for filing a name change petition is $40.
295.  Background checks.  The judge court may require a person seeking a name 
30change to undergo one or more of the following background checks:  a criminal history 
31record check; a motor vehicle record check; or a credit check.  The judge court may 
32require the person to pay the cost of each background check required.
336.  Denial of petition brought for improper purpose.  The judge court may not 
34change the name of a person if the judge court has reason to believe that the person is 
35seeking the name change for purposes of defrauding another person or entity or for 
36purposes otherwise contrary to the public interest.

6SUMMARY
7This bill clarifies and consolidates in a single section of Maine law the process and 
8standards for changing the names of adults and minors.  The current process to change the 
9name of an adult is for the adult to file a petition in the Probate Court in the county where 
10the adult lives, except when an adult is petitioning to change that adult's name pursuant to 
11a divorce proceeding, and this bill does not change that.  This bill provides that a parent 
12or guardian of a minor may file a name change petition for the minor in the Probate Court 
13in the county in which the minor lives, unless the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction 
14regarding the minor pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 4, section 152, 
15subsection 5-A, in which case the petition must be filed in District Court.  The bill also 
16permits a parent or guardian to request to change the minor's name as part of a proceeding 
17concerning parentage or other parental rights with respect to the minor in the District 
18Court.  A separate petition is not required in these cases.
19This bill requires the parent or legal guardian who requests a name change for the 
20minor in District Court to provide notice pursuant to the applicable rules of procedure to 
21any other parent, any guardian and any person or agency with legal custody of the minor 
22and to the minor if the minor is 14 years of age or older.  The court must provide an 
23opportunity for those entitled to notice to be heard and may change the name of the minor 
24if the court finds that the change is in the best interest of the minor.
25Because this bill consolidates the provisions governing the process for change of 
26name, except in the case of annulment, divorce or adoption, it revises the provision in the 
27Maine Parentage Act providing for change of name of a minor on determination of 
28parentage.
