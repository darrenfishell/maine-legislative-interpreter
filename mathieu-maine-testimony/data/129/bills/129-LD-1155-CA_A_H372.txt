23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment makes several changes to the bill. 
25 1. It removes the reference to inadequately controlled pain and uses the phrase 
26 "severe pain" to maintain consistency with the definition used in the federal Patient 
27 Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
28 2. It clarifies the definition of "emergency service" so that it applies to services 
29 provided in an emergency setting or facility and makes other changes to maintain 
30 consistent language within the definition .. 
31 3. It removes the reference to prior authorization for emergency services in section 2 
32 of the bill because it is redundant with changes made in section 3. 
33 4. It clarifies that before a carrier denies benefits or reduces payment for an 
34 emergency service based on a determination of the absence of an emergency medical 
35 condition or a detennination that a lower level of care was needed, the carrier's utilization 
36 review must be done by a board-certified emergency physician who is licensed in this 
37 State and that the review must include a review of the enrollee's medical record related to
