Page 1 - 129LR0422(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง5219-L, sub-ยง1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 502, Pt. J, ยง1 and 
3affected by ยง3, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:
41.  Super credit allowed for substantial expansions of research and development.  
5For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, a taxpayer that qualifies for the 
6research expense tax credit allowed under section 5219-K is allowed an additional credit 
7against the tax due under this Part equal to the excess, if any, of qualified research 
8expenses for the taxable year over the super credit base amount.  For purposes of this 
9section, "super credit base amount" means the greater of the average annual amount spent 
10on qualified research expenses by the taxpayer in the 3 taxable years immediately 
11preceding:
12A.  The tax year for which the credit is taken; and
13B.  The effective date of this subsection.
14For purposes of this section, "qualified research expenses" has the same meaning as under 
15the Code, Section 41 but applies only to expenditures for research conducted in this State.
16Sec. 2.  Retroactivity; application.  This Act applies retroactively to tax years 
17beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
18SUMMARY
19Under a tax credit that expired January 1, 2014, a taxpayer that qualified for a 
20research expense tax credit was allowed a so-called super credit for qualified research 
21expenses for research conducted in this State.  A taxpayer who had unused credits may 
22carry over any unused credit for the next succeeding 10 years, except that the credit is 
23limited to no more than 25% of the taxpayer's tax due after the allowance of other tax 
24credits.
25This bill restores the availability of the super credit, retroactive to January 1, 2014, 
26and resets the base amount to the average annual amount spent by the taxpayer on 
27qualified research expenses during the 3 years before the credit is taken or during the 3 
28years before the effective date of this legislation, whichever is greater.
