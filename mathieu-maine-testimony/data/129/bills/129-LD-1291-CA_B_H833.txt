13SUMMARY
14This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.  
15It replaces the bill, which is a concept draft.
16The only difference from the majority report is that it retains the terminology of 
17"woman" who gave birth rather than making it gender neutral.
18This amendment amends the Maine Parentage Act to include 2 provisions that are 
19part of the Uniform Parentage Act adopted by the Uniform Law Commission in 2017.
20The amendment amends the acknowledgment of paternity provision to broaden the 
21process to be an acknowledgment of parentage and allows intended parents participating 
22in assisted reproduction, as well as presumed parents, to sign the acknowledgment of 
23parentage.  
24The amendment adds a new subchapter 9 to the Maine Parentage Act to apply to the 
25collection and sharing of information about donors who donate gametes used in assisted 
26reproduction.  It requires gamete banks and fertility clinics to collect information from 
27donors and requires a donor to sign a declaration allowing the sharing of identifying 
28information about the donor or prohibiting the sharing of identifying information about 
29the donor.  A person conceived by assisted reproduction who has attained 18 years of age 
30or, if the person is a minor, the parent or guardian may request identifying information 
31about the donor from the gamete bank or fertility clinic.  If the donor signed a declaration 
32prohibiting the sharing of identifying information about the donor, the gamete bank or 
33fertility clinic may share only nonidentifying information.  If the donor did not agree to 
34the sharing of identifying information, the gamete bank or fertility clinic must make a 
35good faith effort to contact the donor, who may then authorize the sharing of the 
36information.  Otherwise, the gamete bank or fertility clinic may share the identifying 
37information upon request.  The person or, if the person is a minor, the parent or guardian 
38may request nonidentifying information about the donor, and the gamete bank or fertility 
39clinic is required to make a good faith effort to provide the information.
