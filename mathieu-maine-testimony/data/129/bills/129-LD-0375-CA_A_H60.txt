129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " A" to H.P. 284, L.D. 375, Bill, "An Act To 
Promote the Forest Products Industry in School Construction and Renovation Involving 
Heating Systems" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §15908-B is enacted to read: 
§15908-B. Heating systems 
In approving school construction projects, the state board shall ensure that school 
administrative units have considered heating systems that use renewable, locally sourced 
wood-based fuels and that benefit the State's economy and reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions in all planning and design for new or substantially renovated schools or school 
buildings subject to state board approval. 
As used in this section, "substantially renovated" has the same meaning as in section 
15908-A, subsection 1.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that, in approving school construction projects, the State 
Board of Education is required to ensure that school administrative units have considered 
heating systems that use renewable, locally sourced wood-based fuels and that benefit the 
State's economy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in all planning and design for new 
or substantially renovated schools or school buildings subject to state board approval. The 
amendment strikes the requirement that the school administrative unit demonstrates a 
preference for modern wood heating systems.
