11 SUMMARY 
12 This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, amends the bill as 
13 follows. 
14 1. It makes the definition of "recovery" consistent with the definition of "recovery 
15 support services." 
16 2. It allows for a short-term rental subsidy to be provided for a person in recovery so 
17 that the rental subsidy may be provided to an administrator of the recovery residence not 
18 only the person in recovery directly. 
19 3. It removes the requirement that recovery residences provide medication-assisted 
20 treatment as a condition of receiving a short-term rental subsidy and instead requires that 
21 the recovery residences must permit medication-assisted treatment. 
22 4. It makes the Maine State Housing Authority's rule-making authority permissive 
23 with respect to providing a short-term rental subsidy for a person in recovery. 
24 5. It removes the appropriations and allocations section so that the short-term rental 
25 subsidy can be provided within existing budgeted resources. 
26 6. It removes certain provisions that add "recovery" to "substance. use disorder 
27 prevention and treatment" that have substantive implications beyond the scope of this 
28 legislation. 
29 7. It adds an appropriations and allocations section.
