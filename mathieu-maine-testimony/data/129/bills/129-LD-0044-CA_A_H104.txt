Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would establish a new Class C crime for the reckless violation of a duty of care or protection that results in 
death or serious bodily injury to a child. According to data pertaining to the maltreatment of a child resulting in death 
where neglect was present, it is anticipated that the establishment of this crime will result in an additional 2 
convictions per year. Given the effective date of the bill, only one additional conviction under the new crime is 
anticipated in FY 2019-20. 
The current average cost to the Department of Corrections for a Class C crime is $44, 106 per sentence based on an 
average length of stay of 364 days, with an additional $2,03 8 for probation costs. The bill includes general fund 
appropriations to the Department of Corrections of $44,106 in FY 2019-20 and $90,250 in FY 2020-21.
