6SUMMARY
7This bill creates requirements that a municipality must meet in order to provide

9requires the municipality to hold a referendum to decide whether the municipality may 
10offer broadband service.  It includes general operation limitations, including those related 
11to the establishment of rates, the use of subsidization and the use of eminent domain.  It 
12requires the adoption of ordinances relating to service quality and enforcement by a 
13municipality that elects to provide broadband service.  It also removes antitrust liability 
14protections from a municipality as those protections relate to the municipality's offering 
15broadband service.
16The bill also requires that in order to receive any grants from the ConnectME 
17Authority, the municipality must show evidence of compliance with the requirements of 
18the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, chapter 94.
