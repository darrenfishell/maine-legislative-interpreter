SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the resolve 
to provide that the 25% rate increase for assertive community treatment is ongoing. It 
removes the directive to the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with a 
3rd party to conduct a rate study. It also replaces the appropriations and allocations 
section to reflect a change in funding.

The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of $476,389 
I in fiscal year 2018-19, $1,905,557 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,905,557 in fiscal year 2020-21 for an increase to 
certain rates under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapters II and III, Section 17 by 25% 
The funding provided for this bill is all General Fund. This was precipitated by PL 2017 c. 460 which increased rates 
for services in Sections 17, _23 and 65 which are included in the Clinic Upper Payment Limit calculations. The impact 
of those increases put the department at or slightly above the amount allowed to be paid by the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services. As a result, the rate increase in this bill will have to be paid with state general fund money 
only.
