Fiscal Note 
Redistribution of state subsidy -Local school administrative units 
This legislation repeals the section of cmTent law tha~ requires the per-pupil allocation for system administration 
beginning in fiscal year 2020-21 be detennined by the Commissioner of Education based on a review by a statewide 
education policy research institute and allocated to only those school administrative units (SAU's) that have 
established regionalized administrative services. Instead, it sets the allocation at $135 per pupil for all SAU's. 
Changing the way in which the allocation for system administration is to be distributed beginning in fiscal year 2020-
21 will result in a redistribution of state subsidy, with some SAU's receiving more subsidy than would have been 
received absent this legislation and some SAU's receiving less. The impact to individual SAU's can not be determined.
