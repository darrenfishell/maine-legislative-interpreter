9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "Rr, "to S.P. 17, L.D. 53, Bill, "An Act To Clarify 
1 O Local Referendum Ballots" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
12 'Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §2501, sub-§4 is enacted to read: 
13 4. Ballot questions. Notwithstanding the provision of Title 21-A, section 906, 
14 subsection 7 requiring sequential numbering of ballot questions, municipal officers may 
15 elect to list municipal initiative and referendum questions on the ballot using sequential 
16 capital letters of the alphabet instead of sequential numbers. All other provisions of Title 
17 21-A, section 906, subsection 7 apply.' 
18 Amend the bill in section 2 in paragraph C by striking out all of the 2nd sentence 
19 (page 1, lines 11 to 13 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 'Notwithstanding the 
20 provision of Title 21-A, section 906, subsection 7 requiring sequential numbering of 
21 ballot questions, the questions may be listed on the ballot using sequential capital letters 
22 of the alphabet instead of sequential numbers in accordance with section 2501, subsection 
23 4. All other provisions of Title 21-A, section 906, subsection 7 apply.' 
24 SUMMARY 
25 This amendment allows municipal officers to use sequential capital letters for 
26 municipal initiative and referendum questions, rather than requiring the use of sequential 
27 capital letters as in the bill. This amendment also clarifies that only the portion of the 
28 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 906, subsection 7 regarding the required use 
29 of sequential numbers is not applicable to the provisions of this legislation.
