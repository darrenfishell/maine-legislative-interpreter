4. Triennial plan. The board shall vote on a detailed, triennial, energy efficiency, 
alternative energy resources and conservation plan that includes the quantifiable measmes 
ef performance metrics developed under subsection 3 and make a full report of the vote 
to the commission in accordance with this subsection. The triennial plan must provide 
integrated planning, program design and implementation strategies for all energy 
efficiency, alternative energy resources and conservation programs a<;lministered by the

Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund under section 10119 and any state or federal 
funds or publicly directed funds accepted by or allocated to the trust for the purposes of 
this chapter. The triennial plan must include provisions for the application of appropriate 
program funds to support workforce development efforts that are consistent with and

business to participate in a natural gas conservation program. All amounts collected 
under this subsection must be transferred to the natural gas conservation fund. Any 
interest on funds in the fund must be credited to the fund. Funds not spent in any fiscal 
year remain in the fund to be used for the purposes of this section. 
The assessments eharged to funds collected from gas utilities under this section are just 
and reasonable costs for rate-making purposes and must be reflected in the rates of gas 
utilities. 
All funds collected pursuant to this section are collected under the authority and for the 
purposes of this section and are deemed to be held in trust for the purposes of benefiting 
natural gas consumers served by the gas utilities assessed under this subseetion. In the 
event funds are not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years of being 
collected from consumers, the commission shall ensure that the value of those funds is 
returned to consumers. 
For purposes of this subsection, "large-volume manufacturer" means a customer that is a 
gas utility ratepayer engaged in manufacturing in the State and purchases at least 
1,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural gas per year. For purposes of this subsection, 
"large-volume agricultural business" means a customer that is a gas utility ratepayer that 
purchases at least 1,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural gas per year and is engaged in 
the commercial growing or harvesting of plants or commercial aquaculture, as defined in 
Title 12, section 6001, subsection 1, in the State. 
When determining the maximum achievable cost-effective natural gas energy efficiency 
resources, the commission shall apply the discount rate adopted by the trust and ensure 
that the calculations of avoided energy costs are consistent with rules adopted by the trust 
and are supported by evidence in the record. A voided energy costs must include but are 
not limited to the retail value of natural gas supply including a wholesale risk premium 
and demand reduction induced price effects. The trust shall use, and the commission 
shall give deference to, values for each element of avoided energy cost from a regional 
avoided energy cost study as long as the analysis has been developed through a 
transparent process, with input from state agencies, public advocates, utilities or energy 
efficiency administrators from at least 3 other states in New England and the analysis has 
been published not more than 24 months prior to the trust's filing of the triennial plan. 
When values specific to the State are not available in the regional study, the trust may 
use, and the commission shall give deference to, regional values provided in that regional 
study or values determined from other sources when supported by evidence in the record. 
Rules adopted by the commission under this subsection are routine technical rules as
