STATE OF MAINE 
SENATE 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT" A." to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 107, 
L.D. 125, "Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
To Convey Certain Lands to Roosevelt Conference Center Doing Business as Eagle Lake 
Sporting Camps" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 by striking out all of the last indented paragraph 
(page 2, lines 1 to 4 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
'The director shall ensure that the deed conveying the land contains the following 
covenant, or words to such effect: As a condition of the conveyance of the property, 
Eagle Lake Sporting Camps and its successors and assigns agree that they will never ask 
for any changes to the deed and that they will neither ask for nor accept any further grants 
of land from the State other than the 12.86-acre parcel conveyed pursuant to this resolve. 
A violation of this covenant results in the immediate reversion of the parcel to the State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the language from the committee amendment that required 
the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry to provide an opportunity for comment if the director intends 
to lease any more land to Eagle Lake Sporting Camps other than the land conveyed 
pursuant to the resolve. Instead, this amendment requires that the director have placed in 
the deed words to the effect that Eagle Lake Sporting Camps and its successors and 
assigns agree that they will never ask for any changes to the deed and that they will 
neither ask for nor accept any further grants of land from the State other than the 12.86-
acre parcel conveyed pursuant to this resolve. A violation of this covenant results in the 
immediate reversion of the parcel to the State.
