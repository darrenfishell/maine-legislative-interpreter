34SUMMARY
35This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 
36vehicles, including commercial motor vehicles, buses and camper trailers, and mobile 
37homes registered in the State.
38With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles and buses and special 
39mobile equipment, current law requires that the excise tax be based upon the maker's list 
40price for the motor vehicle or mobile home; the excise tax on certain commercial motor 
Page 3 - 129LR1369(01)-11vehicles and buses and special mobile equipment is based on the purchase price.  This bill 
2requires that the excise tax for all motor vehicles, mobile homes and camper trailers be 
3based upon the actual value of the vehicle or mobile home at the time of delivery to the 
4owner, as determined by sources approved by the State Tax Assessor.
5Current law requires the State to reimburse a municipality for the difference in the 
6amount of excise tax that would have been collected by the municipality on each 
7commercial motor vehicle or bus using the manufacturer's suggested retail price instead 
8of the actual purchase price.  This bill applies that requirement to all vehicles registered 
9and taxed by the municipality using the actual value.
