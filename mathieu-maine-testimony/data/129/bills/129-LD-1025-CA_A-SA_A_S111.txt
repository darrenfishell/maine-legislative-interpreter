"aversive practice or treatment" as any practice or treatment that is intended to induce 
changes in behavior through unpleasant stimuli or punishment and provides examples of 
aversive practices or treatments. 
2. It provides that advertising, offering or administering conversion therapy to 
individuals under 18 years of age in the State is an unfair trade practice. Court actions

Maine Health Security Act for actions involving professional negligence. 
3. It prohibits school psychologists and guidance counselors, nurses, doctors, 
physician assistants, psychologists, psychological examiners, alcohol and drug counselors 
and aides, social workers, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, professional 
counselors, marriage and family therapists, pastoral counselors, speech-language 
pathologists and assistants and audiologists from administering conversion therapy to 
individuals under 18 years of age. Administration of conversion therapy to an individual 
under 18 years of age in violation of this prohibition is grounds for discipline of the 
professional by the department or board that issued the professional's license, certification 
or registration, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of the license, 
certification or registration. 
4. It prohibits MaineCare reimbursement for conversion therapy administered to an
