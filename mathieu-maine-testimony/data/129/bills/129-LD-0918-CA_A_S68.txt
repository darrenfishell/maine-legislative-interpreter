Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to adopt rules to require a one-time payment from a 
transmission and distribution utility to a person who constructs an underground electric line extension upon the 
transfer of ownership of that line to the transmission and distribution utility. Any additional costs to the PUC are 
anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
