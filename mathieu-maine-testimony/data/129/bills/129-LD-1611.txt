17premium subsidies under the federal Affordable Care Act, is appropriated to the Maine

29credits under the federal Affordable Care Act, are paid directly to the Maine Health Fund.  
30When all required waivers, exemptions, agreements and legislation are obtained, the 
31Maine Health Plan assumes responsibility for all health care benefits and health care 
32services previously paid for with federal funds.  In obtaining the waivers, exemptions, 
33agreements or legislation, the Governor and, if required, commissioners shall seek from 
34the Federal Government a contribution for health care services in the State that reflects: 
35medical inflation, the state gross domestic product, the size and age of the population of 
36the State, the number of residents of the State living below the poverty level and the 
37number of individuals in this State eligible for Medicare and services from the federal 
38Department of Veterans Affairs and that does not decrease in relation to the federal 
39contributions to other states as a result of the waivers, exemptions, agreements or savings 
40from implementation of the Maine Health Plan.
Page 8 - 129LR1913(01)-115.  Federal preemption.  The board shall seek to secure a repeal or a waiver of any 
2provision of federal law that preempts any provision of this chapter.  The Commissioner 
3of Health and Human Services shall provide all necessary assistance.  In the application 
4for an innovation waiver under Section 1332 of the federal Affordable Care Act, the 
5board shall request to waive any of the following provisions of the federal Affordable 
6Care Act to the extent necessary to implement this Act:
7A.  In 42 United States Code, Sections 18021 to 18024;
8B.  In 42 United States Code, Sections 18031 to 18033;
9C.  In 42 United States Code, Section 18071; and
10D.  In 26 United States Code, Sections 36B and 5000A.
11In the event that a repeal or a waiver of law or regulations cannot be secured, the board 
12shall adopt rules, or seek conforming state legislation, consistent with federal law, in an 
13effort to best fulfill the purposes of this chapter.
146.  Secondary to federal government programs.  The Maine Health Plan's 
15responsibility for providing care is secondary to existing federal government programs 
16for health care services to the extent that funding for these programs is not transferred to 
17the Maine Health Fund or that the transfer is delayed beyond the date on which initial 
18benefits are provided under the Maine Health Plan.
197.  No cost sharing.  Except as provided in section 7504, subsection 4, no deductible, 
20copayment, coinsurance or other cost sharing may be imposed with respect to covered 
21benefits.
22§7508.  Subrogation
231.  Collateral source.  When other payers for health care have been terminated, 
24health care costs must be collected from collateral sources whenever medical services 
25provided to an individual are, or may be, covered services under a policy of insurance, or 
26other collateral source available to that individual, or when the individual has a right of 
27action for compensation permitted under law.
28A.  As used in this section, "collateral source" includes:

30homeowner's and other forms of insurance;

32(3)  Pension plans;
33(4)  Employer plans;
34(5)  Employee benefit contracts;
35(6)  Government benefit programs;
36(7)  A judgment for damages for personal injury;
37(8)  The state of last domicile for individuals moving to the State for medical care 
38who have extraordinary medical needs; and
Page 9 - 129LR1913(01)-11(9)  Any 3rd party who is or may be liable to an individual for health care 
2services or costs.
3B.  As used in this section, "collateral source" does not include:
4(1)  A contract or plan that is subject to federal preemption; or
5(2)  Any governmental unit, agency or service to the extent that subrogation is 
6prohibited by law.  An entity described in paragraph A is not excluded from the 
7obligations imposed by this section by virtue of a contract or relationship with a 
8governmental unit, agency or service.
9C.  The board shall negotiate waivers, seek federal legislation or make other 
10arrangements to incorporate collateral sources into the Maine Health Plan.
112.  Notification.  When an individual who receives health care services under the 
12Maine Health Plan is entitled to coverage, reimbursement, indemnity or other 
13compensation from a collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider 
14and provide information identifying the collateral source, the nature and extent of 
15coverage or entitlement and other relevant information.  The health care provider shall 
16forward this information to the board.  The individual entitled to coverage, 
17reimbursement, indemnity or other compensation from a collateral source shall provide 
18additional information as requested by the board.
193.  Reimbursement.  The Maine Health Board shall seek reimbursement from the 
20collateral source for services provided to the individual and may institute appropriate 
21action, including legal proceedings, to recover the reimbursement.  Upon demand, the 
22collateral source shall pay to the Maine Health Fund the sums it would have paid or 
23expended on behalf of the individual for the health care services provided by the Maine 
24Health Plan.
25A.  In addition to any other right to recovery provided in this section, the board has 
26the same right to recover the reasonable value of health care benefits from a collateral 
27source as provided to the Commissioner of Health and Human Services.
28B.  If a collateral source is exempt from subrogation or the obligation to reimburse 
29the Maine Health Plan, the board may require that an individual who is entitled to 
30medical services from the source first seek those services from that source before 
31seeking those services from the Maine Health Plan.
32C.  To the extent permitted by federal law, the board has the same right of 
33subrogation over contractual retiree health care benefits provided by employers as 
34other contracts, allowing the Maine Health Plan to recover the cost of health care 
35services provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits, unless arrangements 
36are made to transfer the revenues of the health care benefits directly to the Maine 
37Health Fund.
384.  Defaults, underpayments and late payments.  Default, underpayment or late 
39payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by this chapter results in the remedies 
40and penalties provided by law, except as provided in this section.  Eligibility for health 
41care benefits under this chapter may not be impaired by any default, underpayment or late 
42payment of any premium or other obligation imposed by this chapter.

5governing referral fees and fee splitting, including, but not limited to, 42 United States 
6Code, Sections 1320a-7b and 1395nn, whether reimbursed by federal funds or not.  A fee 
7schedule or financial incentive may not adversely affect the care a patient receives or the 
8care a health care provider recommends.

10establish and oversee a fair and efficient payment system for noninstitutional providers in 
11accordance with this subsection.

33investment plan that will serve as a guide in determining the annual budgets of 
34institutional providers and in deciding whether to approve applications for approval of 
35capital expenditures by noninstitutional providers.  Providers who propose to make 
36capital purchases in excess of $500,000 must obtain board approval.  The board may alter 
37the threshold expenditure level that triggers the requirement to submit information on 
38capital expenditures.  Institutional providers shall propose these expenditures and submit 
39the required information as part of the annual budget they submit to the board.  
40Noninstitutional providers shall submit applications for approval of these expenditures to 
41the board.  The board shall respond to capital expenditure applications in a timely
