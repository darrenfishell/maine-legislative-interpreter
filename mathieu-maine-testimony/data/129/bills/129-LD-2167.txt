 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID -19 has 3 
created a public h ealth emergency; and  4 
Whereas, COVID -19 is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal disease that has 5 
infected more than 138,000 people and caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide, 6 
including more than 1,600 infected and 41 deaths in the United States; and  7 
Whe reas, in response to this widespread disease, the World Health Organization has 8 
declared a pandemic, the President of the United States has declared a national 9 
emergency and the Governor of Maine has declared a civil state of emergency; and  10 
Whereas, state and federal authorities, including the federal Centers for Disease 11 
Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, Maine Center for 12 
Disease Control and Prevention and the Governor of Maine have recommended 13 
cancellation and postponement  of gatherings during the spring of 2020; and  14 
Whereas, the most recommended ways of avoiding infection and further spreading 15 
the virus that causes the disease are for the authorities to reduce the number of public 16 
gatherings and for people to avoid large c rowds; and  17 
Whereas, in an effort to comply with these recommendations, colleges and 18 
universities across the nation have suspended their academic years and closed their 19 
campuses; professional and collegiate sports teams have placed their seasons on an 20 
indef inite hiatus; concerts, conferences and conventions that attract large crowds have 21 
been cancelled; and the United States Congress has barred the public from the grounds of 22 
the United States Capitol; and  23 
Whereas, municipal leaders seek to ensure public safe ty by acting in concert with 24 
public health guidelines by discouraging large gatherings and also recognize the 25 
likelihood of low voter turnout at meetings held, depriving voters of full participation in 26 
municipal decisions; and  27 
Whereas, there is no procedur e in Maine law to postpone a municipal secret ballot 28 
election or nomination process already in progress, and delay of municipal budget 29 
meetings will deprive municipal authorities of legal authority to spend and continue 30 
operations; and  31 
Whereas, it is imper ative that action be taken at the earliest possible moment to 32 
allow for continuity of services by municipalities despite the need to postpone meetings; 33 
and 34 
Whereas, in addition to the assistance already being provided by the banks and 35 
credit unions in Main e, it is imperative that the State respond quickly and in an 36 
appropriate manner to the needs of its residents who have experienced a reduction in or 37 
loss of income due to the impact of COVID -19; and  38 
 
 Page 2 - 129LR3296(01) -1 
 Whereas, it is in the best interests of the citizens of M aine to temporarily provide 1 
authorization to the Governor to waive certain restrictions, deadlines and requirements 2 
and take other necessary measures that allow the State to react quickly, efficiently and 3 
effectively to the effects of the pandemic on the c itizens of Maine; and  4 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 5 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 6 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, heal th and safety; now, 7 
therefore,  8 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  9

the loans eligible credit unions and financial institutions  make to affected employees. 14 
Under the program, affected employees are eligible for up to 3 loans, each equal to their 15 
monthly after -tax pay, up to $5,000, less unemployment benefits.  Repayment is due 16 
starting 90 days after the end of the state of emergen cy and during the subsequent 6 17

the end of the 270 days, a credit union or financial institution that made a loan under the 19 
program, after a good faith effort to colle ct the principal amount of the loan, may apply to 20 
the authority for repayment of the uncollected amount of the loan in default.  The 21 
authority is required to make reasonable efforts to recoup the amount of any payments 22 
made to credit unions and financial i nstitutions from the employee who defaulted on the 23 
loan.  The authority may not make any loans after December 31, 2020 and the program 24 
ends once all obligations for payment, repayment or discharge of the loans are satisfied.  25 
The bill gives the Joint Stand ing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 26

Part J delays from April 22, 2020 to January 15, 2021 the requirement that a retail 28 
establishment charge a fee of at leas t 5¢ per recycled paper or reusable plastic bag used at 29 
the point of sale.  Part J also moves up from April 22, 2020 to March 17, 2020 the date on 30 
which the State occupies the whole field of regulation of single -use carry -out bags at 31 
retail establishments,  but delays until January 15, 2021 the voiding of any municipal 32 
ordinance in conflict with state law.  33 
Part K authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to require a 34 
designated health care facility to report specific information to the departmen t, such as 35 
the health care facility's emergency management plan and, on a daily basis, the number of 36

Depending upon the actions the Governor takes, additional election costs to the Department of Secretary of State may 
be incurred. No estimate can be made until any such actions are determined. Additional costs to the Office of the Governor associated with Part L can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.Additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services associated with Part K can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.Part I of this bill establishes the Loan Guarantee Program Fund (Fund) within the Office of Treasurer of State with a 
one-time transfer of $500,000 from the General Fund in fiscal year 2019-20. It also includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation to the Office of the Treasurer of State of $500,000 in fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 to expend the funds. If this amount is not sufficient to cover the State's liability, additional funding will be required. The Fund will be used to guarantee the repayment of the amount of loans made by eligible financial institutions to Maine residents who have experienced a reduction in income since January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020 due to COVID-19. The bill allows loans up to a maximum of the lesser of $5,000 or an individual's most recent monthly after-tax pay reduced by any unemployment compensation benefits. Individuals are eligible to apply for up to 3 loans under the program. Administrative costs incurred by the Office of Treasurer of State can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Part I also includes a provision that allows the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) to retain a portion of the money it recovers from loans in default to pay for its costs to administer the loan guarantee program. FAME will not require a General Fund appropriation. However, this provision will reduce the amount of funds returned to the Loan Guarantee Program Fund from the recovery of defaulted loans.Legislation in Part B of this bill also waives the one week waiting period that must be served before an individual who 
is dislocated or temporarily laid off as a result of a public health emergency can begin collecting unemployment benefits. The cost to the State as a direct reimbursement employer will depend on such factors as the number of employees affected, the length of the work stoppage and the amount of leave employees have available to use during the time they are out. Under Part B of the bill, benefits paid to individuals who are dislocated or temporarily laid off as a result of a public 
health emergency are not to be charged against the experience rating record of any employer. This means that the future contribution rate of employers will not be increased for unemployment benefits attributable to a public health emergency. The Department of Labor has estimated that if the unemployment rate were to increase from the approximately 3% rate (as of December 2019) to 4% from April 1, 2020 to May 30, 2020, the impact to the Fund would be approximately $8.4 million. If the unemployment rate were to increase to 5% over the same time period, the impact to the Fund would be approximately $16.2 million. The additional cost will depend on actual experience. Direct reimbursement employers would continue to be charged for benefits to their employees.
Additional costs to the Department of Public Safety, Emergency Medical Services, associated with Part C can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
