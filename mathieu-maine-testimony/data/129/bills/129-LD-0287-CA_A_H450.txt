SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the duty that the bill imposes on certain professionals to 
warn and protect if a patient or client is likely to engage in physical violence by limiting 
the duty to cases in which there is a belief that the patient is likely to pose a serious risk 
of harm to self or others. The bill includes a duty with regard to a serious threat of 
substantial damage to real property, which this amendment deletes. 
This amendment also replaces the immunity language provided in the bill to make 
clear that there is no monetary liability and that the specific mental health professionals 
are not subject to a cause of action based on the disclosure of information to a 3rd party in 
an effort to discharge the duty to warn or protect.
