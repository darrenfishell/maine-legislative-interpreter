COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
~,;COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "fi" to H.P. 96, L.D. 114 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, makes the following 
3 changes to the election laws to implement the open primary election procedure authorized 
4 in the bill. 
5 1. It reduces the number of candidate petition signatures that an unenrolled candidate 
6 for the office of United States Senator, United States Representative, Governor, State 
7 Senator or State Representative must obtain to be placed on the open primary ballot to 
8 match the number of petition signatures that a party candidate for the same office must 
9 obtain to be placed on the open primary ballot. 
10 2. It authorizes an unenrolled candidate who is certified for participation under the 
11 Maine Clean Election Act and who participates in a contested open primary election to 
12 receive the same amount of distributions from the Maine Clean Election Fund that a 
13 certified party candidate receives for participation in the same contested open primary 
14 election. 
15 3. If one of the 2 candidates who received the most votes at the open primary, as 
16 determined by ranked-choice voting, withdraws from the race at least 70 days before the 
17 general election, it directs the Secretary of State to replace that candidate on the general 
18 election ballot with the candidate who received the next most votes in the open primary 
19 who is willing and able to appear on the general election ballot. If no candidate meets 
20 these criteria, the amendment directs the Secretary of State to place a blank space on the 
21 general election ballot that may be used by a voter to vote for a write-in candidate. 
22 4. It makes a technical change to the deadlines for candidate certification under the 
23 Maine Clean Election Act. 
24 5. It adds an appropriations and allocations section.

The bill provides for open primary elections for certain state and federal offices. The bill includes a General Fund 
appropriation of $250,000 to the Department of Secretary of State in fiscal year 2019-20 for additional ballot printing 
and postage costs. 
The bill also extends the end of the qualifying period for certification of Maine Clean Election Act candidates from 
April 1 to April 20th. In non-gubernatorial election years this date change will have no fiscal impact on the 
Commission for Governmental Ethics and Election Practices (CGEEP). However, the CGEEP has indicated that in 
gubernatorial election years additional temporary staffing may be required to accommodate the additional workload 
of concunently certifying gubernatorial and legislative candidates. The CGEEP has indicated that the Maine Clean 
Election Fund is forecasted to have sufficient resources to fund the cost of the temporary staff.
