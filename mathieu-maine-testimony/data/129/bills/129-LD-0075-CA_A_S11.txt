Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Eliminating the current offset for holiday pay and vacation pay in excess of 4 weeks when calculating a claimant's 
unemployment compensation benefit will increase costs to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20. The Department of Labor (DOL) perfonned an analysis of the impact of this legislation utilizing 
calendar year 2018 data ( average unemployment rate of approximately 3 .0%) and calendar year 2009 data ( average 
unemployment rate of 8.1 % ). According to this analysis, had this provision been in place for calendar year 2018, the 
estimated increase in benefit payments would have been approximately $250,000. Had this provision been in place 
during the recession year of 2009, the estimated benefit increase would have been approximately $720,000. 
Although the DOL has indicated that the impact of this legislation is unlikely to result in an increase in employer tax 
rates in the near future, this expansion of benefits may potentially affect the contribution rate schedule in future 
biennia. The impact to all employers and the timing of the impact can not be determined at this time and will depend 
on the level of benefits paid, contributions received and the balance of the trust fund when the contribution schedule is 
recalculated. 
This bill will increase unemployment costs for state departments and agencies that are in direct reimbursement status. 
The DOL estimates the impact to be between $3,777 (low recession period) and $11,330 (high recession period.) The 
General Fund share of the cost is approximately 53.0% and the Highway Fund share is approximately 13.0%. The 
ability of individual state departments and agencies to absorbed the additional costs can not be determined and will 
depend on actual experience.
