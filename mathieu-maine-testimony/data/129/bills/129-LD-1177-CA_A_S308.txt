Potential current biennium cost increase -All Funds 
Potential current biennium cost increase -University of Maine System 
Potential current biennium cost increase -Local units of government 
Current law regarding labor relations for municipal public employees, University of Maine System employees and 
state employees including judicial employees provides that the determination of an arbitrator regarding salaries, 
pensions and insurance is advisory only. This legislation changes the law to provide that an arbitrator's determination 
regarding these issues is binding on all parties. This may result in increased personnel and other direct and indirect 
costs to the employers of these public employees if, as a result of the arbitrator's decision, salary, pension or insurance 
costs increase more than they would have absent this legislation. The impact cannot be determined at this time. 
Additional costs to the Maine Labor Relations Board can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
