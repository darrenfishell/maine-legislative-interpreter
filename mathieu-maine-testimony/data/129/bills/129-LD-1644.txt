3further amended to read:
42.  Qualifications and requirements.  Members of the board must be chosen to 
5represent the broadest possible public interest and experience that can be brought to bear 
6on the administration and implementation of this Title and all other laws the board is 
7charged with administering.  At least 3 members must have technical or scientific 
8backgrounds in environmental issues and no more than 4 members may be residents of 
9the same congressional district.  The boundaries of the congressional districts are defined 
10in Title 21-A, chapter 15.  A county commissioner, county employee, municipal official 
11or municipal employee is not considered to hold an incompatible office for purposes of 
12simultaneous service on the board.  If a county or municipality is a participant in an 
13adjudicatory proceeding before the board, a commissioner, official or employee from that 
14county or municipality may not participate in that proceeding.
15Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §341-C, sub-§8, as amended by PL 2011, c. 357, §3, is 
16repealed and the following enacted in its place:
178.  Federal standards.  In accordance with federal standards, board member 
18participation is limited by this subsection.  For the purposes of this subsection, "a 
19significant portion of income" means 10% or more of gross personal income for a 
20calendar year, except that it means 50% or more if the recipient is over 60 years of age 
21and is receiving that portion under retirement, pension or similar arrangement.
22A.  A board member may not participate in the review of or act on an application for 
23a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or the modification, 
24renewal or appeal of a permit under Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution 
25Control Act, 33 United States Code, Section 1342 if the board member receives, or 
26during the previous 2 years has received, a significant portion of income directly or 
27indirectly from license or permit holders or applicants for a license or permit under 
28the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.  Board members whose 
29participation is restricted under this paragraph shall recuse themselves and may not 
30participate in any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System matter as long as 
31the restriction applies.  The recusal must be from all National Pollutant Discharge

39decision or enforcement order under the federal Clean Air Act, 42 United States

43participation is restricted under this paragraph shall recuse themselves from all 
Page 2 - 129LR2393(01)-11permitting and enforcement matters under the federal Clean Air Act.  The restriction 
2imposed by this paragraph may not be interpreted to be more restrictive than federal 
3law or the regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
