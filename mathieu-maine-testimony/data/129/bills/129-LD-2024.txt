Page 1 - 129LR3126(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §5806, sub-§2, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, c. 497, 
3§1, is amended to read:
42.  Maximum allowable tuition.  The maximum allowable tuition charged to a 
5school administrative unit by a private school is the rate established under subsection 1 or 
6the state average per public secondary student cost as adjusted, whichever is lower, plus 
7an insured value factor.  The insured value factor is computed by dividing 5% of the 
8insured value of school buildings and equipment by the average number of pupils 
9enrolled in the school on October 1st and April 1st of the year immediately before the 
10school year for which the tuition charge is computed.  From school year 2009-2010 to 
11school year 2013-2014, a school administrative unit is not required to pay an insured 
12value factor greater than 5% of the school's tuition rate or $500 per student, whichever is 
13less, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to authorize its 
14school board to pay a higher insured value factor that is no greater than 10% of the 
15school's tuition rate per student.  For the 2014-2015 school year, a school administrative 
16unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than 6% of the school's tuition 
17rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to 
18authorize its school board to pay a higher insured value factor that is no greater than 10% 
19of the school's tuition rate per student.  Beginning in the 2015-2016 school year, a school 
20administrative unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than the amount 
21of the prior school year's insured value factor adjusted by a percentage equal to the 
22percentage change in the state share percentage of the total cost of funding public 
23education in the prior school year as determined by section 15671, subsection 7, 
24paragraph C B as compared to the applicable percentage for the current school year.  In 
25no case may the insured value factor be less than 6% or greater than 10% of the school's 
26tuition rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes 
27to authorize its school board to pay an insured value factor that exceeds the amount 
28otherwise permitted by this subsection by no more than 5% of the school's tuition rate per 
29student.  For the 2013-2014 school year only, the maximum allowable tuition charged to 
30a school administrative unit by a private school that participates in the Maine Public 
31Employees Retirement System must be increased above the amount otherwise permitted 
32under this section by an amount equal to the calculated normal cost of teacher retirement 
33for that school divided by the number of enrolled students as of October 1, 2012.
34Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §15671, sub-§7, ¶C, as amended by PL 2019, c. 343, Pt. C, 
35§2, is repealed.
36SUMMARY
37Current law provides a method of calculating the state share percentage of the total 
38cost of funding public education from kindergarten to grade 12 that includes the unfunded 
39actuarial liability of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System as it applies to 
40teachers.  This bill repeals that provision of law.
