Page 1 - 129LR0718(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §4301, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2013, c. 551, §1, is further 
3amended to read:
47.  Income.  "Income" means any form of income in cash or in kind received by the 
5household, including net remuneration for services performed, cash received on either 
6secured or unsecured credit, any payments received as an annuity, retirement or disability 
7benefits, veterans' pensions, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, benefits 
8under any state or federal categorical assistance program, supplemental security income, 
9social security and any other payments from governmental sources, unless specifically 
10prohibited by any law or regulation, court ordered support payments, income from 
11pension or trust funds, household income from any other source, including relatives or 
12unrelated household members and any benefit received pursuant to Title 36, chapter 907, 
13Title 36, section 5219-II and, Title 36, section 5219-KK and Title 36, section 5219-VV, 
14unless used for basic necessities as defined in section 4301, subsection 1.
15The following items are not available within the meaning of this subsection and 
16subsection 10: 
17A.  Real or personal income-producing property, tools of trade, governmental 
18entitlement specifically treated as exempt assets by state or federal law;
19B.  Actual work-related expenses, whether itemized or by standard deduction, such as 
20taxes, retirement fund contributions, union dues, transportation costs to and from 
21work, special equipment costs and child care expenses; or
22C.  Earned income of children below the age of 18 years who are full-time students 
23and who are not working full time.
24In determining need, the period of time used as a basis for the calculation is the 30-day 
25period commencing on the date of the application.  This prospective calculation does not 
26disqualify an applicant who has exhausted income to purchase basic necessities if that 
27income does not exceed the income standards established by the municipality.  
28Notwithstanding this prospective calculation, if any applicant or recipient receives a lump 
29sum payment prior or subsequent to applying for assistance, that payment must be 
30prorated over future months.  The period of proration is determined by disregarding any 
31portion of the lump sum payment that the applicant or recipient has spent to purchase 
32basic necessities, including but not limited to:  all basic necessities provided by general 
33assistance; reasonable payment of funeral or burial expenses for a family member; 
34reasonable travel costs related to the illness or death of a family member; repair or 
35replacement of essentials lost due to fire, flood or other natural disaster; repair or 
36purchase of a motor vehicle essential for employment, education, training or other day-to-
37day living necessities; repayments of loans or credit, the proceeds of which can be 
38verified as having been spent on basic necessities; and payment of bills earmarked for the 
39purpose for which the lump sum is paid.  All income received by the household between 
40the receipt of the lump sum payment and the application for assistance is added to the 
41remainder of the lump sum.  The period of proration is then determined by dividing the 
42remainder of the lump sum payment by the verified actual monthly amounts for all of the 
43household's basic necessities.  That dividend represents the period of proration 
Page 2 - 129LR0718(01)-11determined by the administrator to commence on the date of receipt of the lump sum 
2payment.  The prorated sum for each month must be considered available to the 
3household for 12 months from the date of application or during the period of proration, 
4whichever is less.
5Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §943-C, sub-§1, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 478, §3, is 
6amended to read:
