Page 1 - 129LR1815(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §201, sub-§3-A, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 294, §2, is 
3amended to read:
4A.  It is demonstrated by clear and convincing a preponderance of the evidence that:
5(1)  The work stress was extraordinary and unusual in comparison to pressures 
6and tensions experienced by the average employee; and
7(2)  The work stress, and not some other source of stress, was the predominant 
8cause of the mental injury.
9The amount of work stress must be measured by objective standards and actual 
10events rather than any misperceptions by the employee; or
11Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §201, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 
12affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
134.  Preexisting condition.  If a work-related injury aggravates, accelerates or 
14combines with a preexisting physical or mental condition, any resulting disability is 
15compensable only if contributed to by the employment in a significant manner.
16SUMMARY
17This bill changes the standard of proof required to demonstrate entitlement to 
18compensation for a mental injury caused by stress so that it is the same standard as is 
19required with respect to physical injuries.  In addition, this bill specifies that a work-
20related injury that aggravates a preexisting mental condition may result in a compensable 
21disability, just as aggravating a preexisting physical condition may.
