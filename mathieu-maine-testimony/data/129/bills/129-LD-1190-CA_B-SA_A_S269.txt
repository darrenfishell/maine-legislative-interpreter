129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT" A--" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "B" to S.P. 364, 
L.D. 1190, Bill, "An Act To Prohibit the Sale and Distribution of Flavored Tobacco 
Products" 
Amend the amendment on page 2 by striking out all of the first paragraph A (page 2, 
lines 9 to 21 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
'A. "Characterizing flavor" means a distinguishable taste or aroma of candy, 
chocolate, vanilla, fruit, berry, nut, herb, spice, honey or an alcoholic drink that is 
imparted to tobacco or tobacco smoke either prior to or dl:lring consumption. 
"Characterizing flavor" does not include a taste or aroma from tobacco. A cigar is _ 
deemed to have a characterizing flavor if the cigar is advertised or marketed as 
having or producing the taste or aroma of candy, chocolate, vanilla, fruit, berry, nut, 
herb, spice, honey or an alcoholic drink, other than the taste or aroma of tobacco, 
imparted either prior to or during consumption of a tobacco product or component 
part thereof, including, but not limited to, tastes or aromas relating to any fruit, 
chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb or spice; 
however, a tobacco product may not be considered to have a characterizing flavor 
solely because of the use of additives or flavorings or the provision of ingredient 
information.' 
SUMMARY 
Committee Amendment "B" provides an exception for the flavors of menthol, mint 
and wintergreen on the list of prohibited flavors in the bill. This amendment removes the 
exception.
