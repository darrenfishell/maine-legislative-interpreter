1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment establishes an income tax exemption for civil service retirement 
3 plan benefits that do not participate in the federal Social Security program in recognition 
4 of the fact that the current law provides an income exemption for all Social Security 
5 benefits in addition to a $10,000 pension exemption for retirement plan benefits. The 
6 amendment phases in greater parity in treatment of the 2 types of pension systems by 
7 increasing the civil service pension deduction amount by $5,000 per year until 2024 when 
8 it reaches the maximum annual benefit that an individual retiring at retirement age would 
9 receive under the federal Social Security Act. 
10 This amendment also adds an appropriation for computer programming costs to add 
11 an additional line to the individual income tax form.
