8 FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" /t "to S.P. 90, L.D. 278, Bill, "An Act Regarding 
10 Pay Equality" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
12 following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 5 MRSA §4577 is enacted to read: 
14 §4577. Compensation history inquiry as evidence of unlawful discrimination 
15 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Legislature finds that despite requirements 
16 regarding equal pay having been a part of the laws of Maine since 1965, wage inequality 
17 is an ongoing issue in the State. Wage inequality causes substantial harm to the citizens 
18 and to the economy of the State. The Legislature finds that when employers base 
19 compensation decisions on compensation history of a prospective employee, it directly 
20 perpetuates this wage inequality. An employer's knowledge of a prospective employee's 
21 compensation history is directly related to the practice of basing compensation decisions 
22 on compensation history. It is the intent of the Legislature to promote the payment of 
23 equal compensation for comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements 
24 relating to skill, effort and responsibility and to prevent unlawful employment 
25 discrimination with respect to compensation. 
26 2. Evidence of unlawful employment discrimination. Evidence of unlawful 
27 employment discrimination under section 4572 and Title 26, section 628 includes, but is 
28 not limited to, an employer's inquiring, either directly or indirectly, about the 
29 compensation history of a prospective employee from the prospective employee or a 
30 current or former employer of the prospective employee or otherwise seeking the 
31 compensation history of a prospective employee. 
32 3. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 2, an employer or employment agency 
33 may inquire about or seek compensation history of an employee or prospective employee 
34 after an offer of employment that includes all te1ms of compensation has been negotiated 
35 and made to the prospective employee: If an employee or prospective employee has 
36 voluntarily disclosed compensation history information, without prompting by the

employer or employment agency, the employer or employment agency may seek to 
2 confirm or permit a prospective employee to confirm such information prior to an offer of 
3 employment. This section does not apply to an employer who inquires about 
4 compensation history pursuant to any federal or state law that specifically requires the 
5 disclosure or verification of compensation history for employment purposes. 
6 Sec. 2. 26 MRSA §626-A, first ,r, as amended by PL 1999, c. 465, §5, is further 
7 amended to read: 
8 Whoever violates any of the provisions of sections 621-A to 623 or section 626, 628, 
9 628-A, 629 or 629-B is subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100 nor more than $500 
10 for each violation. 
11 Sec. 3. 26 MRSA §628, first ,r, as amended by PL 2009, c. 29, §1, is further 
12 amended to read: 
13 An employer may not discriminate between employees in the same establishment on 
14 the basis of sex by paying wages to any employee in any occupation in this State at a rate 
15 less than the rate at which the employer pays any employee of the opposite sex for 
16 comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements relating to skill, effort and 
17 responsibility. Differentials that are paid pursuant to established seniority systems or 
18 merit increase systems or difference in the shift or time of the day worked that do not 
19 discriminate on the basis of sex are not within this prohibition. An employer may not 
20 discharge or discriminate against any employee by reason of any action taken by such 
21 employee to invoke or assist in any manner the enforcement of this section. An employer 
22 may not prohibit an employee from disclosing the employee's own wages or from 
23 inquiring about or disclosing another employee's wages if the purpose of the disclosure or 
24 inquiry is to enforce the rights granted by this section. Nothing in this section creates an 
25 obligation to disclose wages. 
26 Sec. 4. 26 MRSA §628-A is enacted to read: 
27 · §628-A. Compensation history inquiry prohibited 
28 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Legislature finds that despite requirements 
29 regarding equal pay having been a part of the laws of Maine since 1965, wage inequality 
30 is an ongoing issue in the State. Wage inequality causes substantial harm to the citizens 
31 and to the economy of the State. The Legislature fmds that when employers base 
32 compensation decisions on compensation history of a prospective employee, it directly 
33 perpetuates this wage inequality. An employer's knowledge of a prospective employee's 
34 compensation history is directly related to the practice of basing compensation decisions 
35 on compensation history. It is the intent of the Legislature to promote the payment of 
36 equal compensation for comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements 
37 relating to skill, effort and responsibility and to prevent unlawful employment 
38 discrimination with respect to compensation. 
39 2. Prohibition. An employer may not use or inquire about the compensation history 
40 of a prospective employee from the prospective employee or a current or former 
41 employer of the prospective employee unless an offer of employment that includes all 
42 terms of compensation has been negotiated and made to the prospective employee, after

which the employer may inquire about or confirm the prospective employee's 
2 compensation history. 
3 3. Exception. This section does• not apply to an employer who inquires about 
4 compensation history pursuant to any federal or state law that specifically requires the 
5 disclosure or verification of compensation history for employment purposes. 
6 4. Penalty. This section may be enforced pursuant to section 626-A. The civil action 
7 provided pursuant to section 626-A may be brought to enforce this section by or on 
8 behalf of a person affected by a violation of subsection 2 or by the Department of Labor 
9 on behalf of a person affected by a violation of subsection 2. and the plaintiff or plaintiffs 
10 may also seek judgment for compensatory damages.' 
11 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
12 section number to read consecutively. 
13 SUMMARY 
14 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. The amendment prohibits an employer 
15 from inquiring about a prospective employee's compensation history until after an offer of 
16 employment that includes all terms of compensation has been negotiated and made to the 
17 prospective employee. It creates an exception for compensation history sought pursuant 
18 to any federal or state law that specifically requires the disclosure or verification of 
19 compensation history for employment purposes, for example, when such information is 
20 related to economic development programs that specifically create employment 
21 opportunities for persons with low incomes. An employer that violates this provision is 
22 subject to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 per violation and is also 
23 subject to a civil action that may be brought by or on behalf of an affected employee or 
24 applicant by the Department of Labor or the affected employee or applicant. 
25 This amendment also amends the Maine Human Rights Act to provide that evidence 
26 of unlawful employment discrimination includes an employer's seeking information about 
27 a prospective employee's compensation history before an offer of employment, including 
28 all terms of compensation, to the applicant has been made. It also creates an exception 
29 for compensation history sought pursuant to any federal or state law that specifically 
30 requires the disclosure or verification of compensation history for employment purposes.
