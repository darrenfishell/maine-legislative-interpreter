28 section 3472, subsection 6 and "incapacitated adult" in Title 22, section 3472, subsection 
29 10. The amendment designates the following types of theft or fraud as Class B crimes if 
30 the owner of the property is a vulnerable person: theft by unauthorized taking or transfer, 
31 theft by deception, theft by misapplication of property and misuse of entrusted property. 
32 The amendment includes an appropriations and allocations section.

This bill would raise the class 
of various theft crimes if the victim is a vulnerable person to a Class B crime. CuITently 
theft from a vulnerable person could range from a Class E to a Class B crime, depending on the circumstances of the 
case. 
In 2018 the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services handled about 3,400 cases under the theft crime sections 
changed in this bill that were not already charged as Class B crimes. Of these, about 2-5% are estimated to have been 
committed against a vulnerable person. The average incremental cost to the commission of increasing these crimes 
from a class E, D, or C crime to a Class B crime is $750. As a result, this would represent increased costs to the 
commission of $51,000 to $127,500, or an average of $89,250 per year. The bill includes General Fund appropriations 
to the commission of $66,938 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $89,250 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
In addition, the Maine Department of CoITections (DOC) will face increased costs due to more incarcerated 
individuals and individuals incarcerated for longer periods of time. It is unclear how many individuals would be 
convicted of a Class B crime who otherwise would have been charged with a lower class crime. The incremental cost 
of changing a Class C crime to a Class B crime is $27 ,506 per sentence. The incremental cost of changing a Class D 
or E crime to a class B crime is $71,611. The DOC has not indicated the need for additional funding at this time and 
no funding is included in the bill for DOC. 
The collection of additional fine revenue by the courts will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor 
amounts.
