9 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
10 It amends the bill to make clear that the parties to a rent-to-own or option-to-buy contract 
11 may agree to treat the agreement as a residential lease subject to the rental statutes in the 
12 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 14, chapters 709, 710 and 710-A; otherwise the residential 
13 properties foreclosure procedures apply. If the contract is treated as a residential lease 
14 agreement, the down payment is treated as a security deposit and must be returned when 
15 the rental ends. 
16 The bill requires vendors who engage in land installment contracts to be treated as 
17 creditors under the Maine Consumer Credit Code. The amendment exempts vendors who 
18 engage in no more than one land installment contract per year.
