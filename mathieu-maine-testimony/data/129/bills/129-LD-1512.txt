10§103.  Commitment following acceptance of negotiated insanity plea or following 
11verdict or finding of insanity
12When A judgment must state if a court accepts a negotiated plea of not criminally 
13responsible by reason of insanity or when if a defendant is found not criminally 
14responsible by reason of insanity by jury verdict or court finding, the judgment must so 
15state.  In those cases.  Upon a judgment of not criminally responsible by reason of 
16insanity, the court shall order the person committed to the custody of the Commissioner 
17of Health and Human Services to be placed in an appropriate institution for the care and 
18treatment of persons with mental illness or in an appropriate residential program that 
19provides care and treatment for persons who have intellectual disabilities or autism for 
20care and treatment.  If the court determines that a person committed under this section is 
21to be placed in an institution outside the State, prior to the placement the court shall 
22conduct a hearing to determine if the placement outside the State is the least restrictive 
23appropriate placement, if an equivalent placement is not available in the State and if the 
24institution outside the State will comply with the reporting provisions of section 104-A, 
25subsection 1. Subsequent to being placed in an institution outside the State under this 
26section, a person may petition the Superior Court of the county in which the person was 
27committed to determine if the placement outside the State is the least restrictive 
28appropriate placement and if an equivalent placement is not available in the State.  The 
29court shall give reasonable notice of a hearing under this section to the Attorney General 
30and the office of the district attorney that prosecuted the criminal charges for which the 
31person was committed under this section.  A hearing under this section must include the 
32testimony of at least one psychiatrist who has treated the person and a member of the 
33State Forensic Service who has examined the person, the testimony of an independent 
34psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist who is employed by the prosecutor and has 
35examined the person, any other relevant testimony and documentation that the institution 
36outside the State agrees to comply with the reporting provisions of section 104-A, 
37subsection 1. If, after hearing, the court finds that the placement outside the State is not 
38the least restrictive, that there is an equivalent appropriate placement in the State or there 
39is insufficient evidence that the institution outside the State agrees to comply with the 
40reporting provision of section 104-A, subsection 1, the court shall order that the person 
41remain in or be placed in an appropriate placement in the State, which may include an 
42order that the person be returned from outside the State. If the court determines that a Human Services Committee for 
Oversight of Out-of-

2until the institution outside the State agrees in writing to comply with the reporting 
3provisions of section 104-A, subsection 1.  Upon placement in the appropriate institution 
4or residential program and in the event of transfer from one institution or residential 
5program to another of persons a person committed under this section, notice of the 
6placement or transfer must be given by the commissioner to the committing court.

8Service is committed into the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human 
9Services pursuant to this section, the court shall order that the State Forensic Service 
10share any information it has collected or generated with respect to the person with the 
11institution or residential program in which the person is placed and to the committee for 
12oversight of out-of-state forensic patients under section 109 upon request of the 
13committee and production of the person's written authorization under section 109,
