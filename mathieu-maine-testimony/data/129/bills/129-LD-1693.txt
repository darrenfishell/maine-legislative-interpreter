Page 2 - 129LR1343(01)-11§840-B.  Public enforcement action
21.  Initiation of action.  A relator, on behalf of the State and in the name of the State, 
3may initiate a public enforcement action pursuant to the procedures and subject to the 
4limitations specified in section 840-F.  A relator may seek injunctive or declaratory relief 
5that the State would be entitled to seek.  A public enforcement action may be brought in 
6any court of competent jurisdiction for any county in which the alleged conduct occurred 
7and may allege multiple violations that have affected different parties aggrieved by the 
8same defendant.
92.  Penalties.  With respect to public enforcement actions brought pursuant to this 
10subchapter:
11A.  If the State has intervened in the public enforcement action, the State may assess 
12penalties on the defendant;
13B.  If the State has not intervened in the public enforcement action but a responsible 
14state official is authorized to assess a civil penalty, the court shall assess an 
15equivalent civil penalty;
16C.  If state law creates a duty owing to an employee but no civil penalty is 
17specifically provided, the court shall assess a civil penalty of $250 for each aggrieved 
18person for each 2-week period in which the violation occurred;
19D.  The court shall award a penalty for each person aggrieved by each violation 
20during the relevant time period; and
21E.  The court may award a lesser amount of civil penalties than those specified if, 
22based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would 
23result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.
243.  Attorney's fees; costs.  A relator that prevails in a public enforcement action, 
25including by recovering a civil penalty or obtaining declaratory or injunctive relief 
26pursuant to a court decision or settlement, must be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and 
27costs.
284.  Distribution of amounts recovered.  Civil penalties recovered under this section 
29pursuant to a court decision or settlement must be distributed as follows:
30A.  If the State has not intervened, the relator is entitled to 30% of the amount 
31recovered and the remaining 70% of the proceeds of the action or settlement must be 
32returned to the State; and
33B.  If the State has intervened, the relator is entitled to 20% of the amount recovered 
34and the remaining 80% of the proceeds of the action or settlement must be returned to 
35the State.
36The relator shall equitably distribute the share of penalties due the relator among the 
37persons aggrieved by the practices complained of in the public enforcement action. The 
38relator shall submit a distribution summary to the State, which may order a different 
39distribution within 60 days after submission of the distribution summary, as long as the 
40relator receives an award that reflects the burdens and risks assumed by the relator in 
Page 3 - 129LR1343(01)-11prosecuting the action, including any costs incurred by a representative organization that 
2serves as a relator.
35.  Private agreement may not impair right.  The right to bring a public 
4enforcement action under this section may not be impaired by any private agreement.
56.  Commencement of action; statute of limitations.  Notwithstanding any other 
6provision of law to the contrary, a public enforcement action must be commenced within 
7the same period of time that the applicable responsible state official has to bring an action 
8under the applicable statute.  The statute of limitations for bringing a public enforcement 
9action is tolled from the date a relator files a notice pursuant to section 840-F or the date 
10the State commences an investigation, whichever is earlier.
117.  Private action based on same injury.  Nothing in this section limits an aggrieved 
12party's right to pursue a private action based on the same injury.
13§840-C.  Prohibition on certain public enforcement actions by relators
14Notwithstanding the provisions of section 840-B, a public enforcement action may 
15not be brought by a relator:
161.  Action by State.  If the State, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within 
17the time periods set forth in section 840-F for a violation of the same section or sections 
18of the laws under which the relator is attempting to recover a civil penalty or other 
19remedy on behalf of aggrieved employees or others, or files a proceeding to assess 
20penalties or enforce other remedies available to the State, as long as the State serves 
21notice on the relator pursuant to section 840-F.  Actions brought by the State preclude 
22subsequent state enforcement efforts based on the same facts and law, whether brought by 
23the State or by a relator under this subchapter; however, nothing in this section limits the 
24State's right to seek restitution for aggrieved parties as part of a public enforcement action 
25in which it has intervened, and the State shall distribute any amounts it recovers as 
26restitution in the same manner in which it distributes restitution proceeds in other 
27enforcement actions initiated by the State;
282.  Posting, filing, reporting requirements.  For any violation of a posting, notice, 
29agency reporting or filing requirement, except when the filing or reporting requirement 
30involves mandatory payroll or injury reporting; or
313.  Minor variations in legal name or address.  If the violation is for minor 
32variations in the legal name or address of the employer in a wage statement required 
33under section 665 as long as the variations do not impair an employee's ability to 
34promptly and easily identify the employer.
35§840-D.  Public access to information
361.  Publicly available database.  The Attorney General shall establish and maintain a 
37publicly available database of public enforcement actions brought pursuant to this 
38subchapter that includes the names of the parties, the disposition and any other 
39information that the Attorney General by rule prescribes.
Page 4 - 129LR1343(01)-112.  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding subsection 1:
2A.  At the request of an aggrieved party, that aggrieved party's name and personally 
3identifying information must be kept confidential and may not be included in the 
4publicly available database; and
5B.  The Attorney General may redact from the publicly available database certain 
6information associated with a public enforcement action at the request of a relator.
7§840-E.  Retaliation prohibited
81.  Prohibition.  A person may not retaliate, or threaten to retaliate, in any manner 
9against an aggrieved person or whistleblower because:
10A.  The aggrieved person or whistleblower has brought a public enforcement action;
11B.  The aggrieved person or whistleblower has cooperated with a relator in a public 
12enforcement action; or
13C.  The person believes that the aggrieved person or whistleblower may bring a 
14public enforcement action or cooperate with a public enforcement action.
152.  Remedy.  A person aggrieved by a violation of this section may bring an action 
16seeking compensatory and punitive damages or equitable relief, including restraint of 
17prohibited acts, restitution of past and future wages or benefits, reinstatement, costs, 
18reasonable attorney's fees and other appropriate relief.
19§840-F.  Procedure
201.  Required notice; filing fee.  A public enforcement action under this subchapter 
21may not be commenced prior to 30 days after written notice of the claim has been 
22submitted by the relator to the responsible state official and to the Attorney General.  If 
23more than one responsible state official is charged with enforcement of laws at issue in 
24the prospective action, the relator shall provide notice under this subsection to each 
25responsible state official.  The relator shall submit a filing fee of $75, and the time 
26periods set forth in this section begin when both the notice and filing fee have been 
27submitted.  The Attorney General may waive the filing fee in accordance with rules 
28adopted by the Attorney General.
292.  Contents of notice.  The notice under subsection 1, which must be construed in 
30the light most favorable to the relator, must include:
31A.  The name, address and contact information of the alleged violator;
32B.  The name and contact information of the relator;
33C.  If the relator has retained legal counsel, the name, address and contact information 
34of the relator's legal counsel; and 
35D.  A concise statement of the underlying claim reasonably calculated to apprise the 
36responsible state official and the Attorney General of the substance and nature of the 
37claim.
Page 5 - 129LR1343(01)-113.  Amended notice.  If within 30 days of the date upon which a relator files notice in 
2accordance with subsection 1 the Attorney General determines that the notice is not in 
3compliance with this section or the rules adopted pursuant to this section, the Attorney 
4General shall allow the relator to furnish an amended notice.  Such a determination must 
5specify the deficiencies in the notice.  If the Attorney General does not make such a 
6determination within 30 days and provide the relator with an opportunity to amend the 
7notice, the notice is deemed to comply with this section.  The relator has 30 days from 
8receiving a determination by the Attorney General of noncompliance to amend the notice.  
9The amended notice will relate back to the original notice.
104.  Investigation; decision regarding action.  If a responsible state official who 
11receives notice under subsection 1 decides to investigate the alleged violation, the 
12responsible state official shall notify the relator of that decision within 30 calendar days 
13of the date of the notice.  Within 120 calendar days of notifying the relator of that 
14decision, the responsible state official may investigate the alleged violation and take any 
15appropriate action.  If the responsible state official, during the course of that 
16investigation, determines that additional time is necessary to complete the investigation, 
17the responsible state official may extend the time by not more than 60 calendar days and 
18shall issue a notice of the extension.  If the responsible state official determines that no 
19action pursuant to the investigation will be taken, the responsible state official shall notify 
20the relator of that decision by certified mail within 5 business days of the determination.
215.  Commencement of public enforcement action.  Upon the receipt of notice under 
22subsection 4 from a responsible state official that no action pursuant to the investigation 
23will be taken, or if the responsible state official fails to provide timely or any notification 
24or does not take action within the time limits set forth in this section, the relator may 
25commence a public enforcement action.
266.  Objection to relator's counsel.  If the responsible state official does not object to 
27the filing of a public enforcement action pursuant to this section but objects to the State 
28being represented by a particular attorney proposed by the relator, the responsible state 
29official may, within the time limits set forth in subsection 4, file that objection with the 
30Attorney General.  Upon finding, after notice and hearing, that, based on the attorney's 
31past conduct while representing clients, the attorney does not meet the required 
32professional standards of representatives or fails to zealously pursue the remedies 
33available under this subchapter, the Attorney General may order that the public 
34enforcement action may not be filed by the attorney on behalf of the relator.  The statute 
35of limitations is tolled from the time the responsible state official files the objection until 
36the Attorney General issues an order or the time for doing so expires.
377.  Intervention by State.  Within 30 days after the filing of a public enforcement 
38action, the State may intervene as of right and proceed with any and all claims in the 
39action.  After the expiration of the 30-day period, the State may intervene in the public 
40enforcement action for good cause shown, as determined by the court.
41A.  If the State intervenes in a public enforcement action:
42(1)  The State has primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and is not 
43bound by an act of the relator bringing the action;
Page 6 - 129LR1343(01)-11(2)  The relator remains a party to the action;
2(3)  The State may move to dismiss or settle the action after the relator has been 
3notified of the filing of the motion and has been provided with an opportunity to 
4be heard and the court determines that such dismissal or settlement is fair, 
5adequate, reasonable and in the public interest; and
6(4)  Any disposition by the State must provide fair compensation for the 
7attorney's fees and costs expended on behalf of the relator in instituting the 
8action.
9B.  If the State does not intervene in a public enforcement action, the relator has the 
10right to conduct the action subject to the following limitations.
11(1)  The court must review and approve any settlement of any action filed 
12pursuant to this subchapter.  The proposed settlement must be submitted to the 
13responsible state official and to the Attorney General at the same time that it is 
14submitted to the court.  The court may approve a settlement of the action only 
15upon a determination that the settlement or voluntary dismissal is fair, adequate, 
16reasonable and in the public interest.  If the parties reach a settlement after the 
17relator has provided notice pursuant to this subchapter but prior to the action 
18being filed in court, the responsible state official shall review the proposed 
19settlement.  The responsible state official shall approve the settlement if the 
20responsible state official determines it is fair, adequate, reasonable and in the 
21public interest.
22(2)  If the State requests, it must be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the 
23action and must be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts.  The State is 
24responsible for costs associated with service of requested pleadings and 
25deposition transcripts.
26(3)  The State may file, at any time, information or advice with the court as 
27amicus curiae concerning the action.
288.  Prompt trial.  A public enforcement action must be tried promptly, without 
29regard to concurrent adjudication of private claims.
309.  Not subject to rules governing class action suits.  A public enforcement action 
31is not required to meet the requirements governing class action suits in the Maine Rules 
32of Civil Procedure, Rule 23.
3310.  Pretrial discovery.  The rules governing pretrial discovery in a public 
34enforcement action are the same as the rules applicable in other civil actions.  A special 
35showing of merit or other additional requirement may not be imposed on a relator's 
36discovery rights in a public enforcement action.
3711.  Action based on same facts.  If a person brings a public enforcement action, 
38another person may not bring a related public enforcement action based on the same facts 
39unless the court determines that the previously filed public enforcement action has not 
40been diligently prosecuted.
