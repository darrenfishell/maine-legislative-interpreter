2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5This bill proposes to enact certain measures designed to allow for increased 
6flexibility in emergency dispatch protocols.  Currently, structured, standardized call-
7taking processes are implemented to assess a caller's condition, scene information and the 
8appropriate response to dispatch to the emergency. This bill would examine:
91.  Whether protocol-based call-taking processes result, in certain instances, in delays 
10in emergency response and the need for additional staffing;
112.  The extent to which the use of protocols improves or impedes the delivery of 
12emergency services;
133.  Any outstanding issues associated with appropriate and effective training in the 
14use of emergency dispatch protocols; and
154.  The costs associated with the implementation of standardized police dispatch 
16protocols that are borne by municipalities.
