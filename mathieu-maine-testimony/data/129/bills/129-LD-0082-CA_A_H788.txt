25SUMMARY
26This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft.
27This amendment eliminates the requirement that a public guardian or public 
28conservator furnish a bond.  The Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in Perry v. Dean, 
292017 ME 35, that the State, having not explicitly waived its sovereign immunity provided 
30under the Maine Tort Claims Act, is immune to claims against the State for breach of 
31fiduciary duty owed to the person subject to public guardianship or public 
32conservatorship.
33The amendment also deappropriates funds no longer needed due to the elimination of 
34the bond requirement.

Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill eliminates a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services of $14,000 in 
fiscal year 2020-21 as these funds will no longer be required to fund the guardianship bond insurance. The 
guardianship bond insurance has increased in the last  3 years from $14,000 annually to $46,000 annually. However, 
no increase in the appropriation was ever given for this in crease, so the deappropriation is based on the original 
funding level.Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
