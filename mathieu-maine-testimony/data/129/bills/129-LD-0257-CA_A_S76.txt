8 FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A;" to S.P. 69, L.D. 257, Bill, "An Act To Ensure 
10 That the Legislature Has the Information Necessary To Do the Work of the People of 
11 Maine" 
12 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
13 'An Act To Help Ensure That the Legislature Has the Information Necessary To Do 
14 the Work of the People of Maine' 
15 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
16 following: 
17 'Sec. 1. 5 MRSA ยง21201, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 675, Pt. C, ยง 12, is amended to 
18 read: 
19 ยง21201. Findings 
20 The Legislature finds that difficulties in interactions among the Exeoutive 
21 Department executive branch, the Legislature and the Judioial Department judicial branch 
22 often arise from the lack of understanding of the functions, structures, needs and 
23 perspectives of the 3 separate but coequal branches of government. Increased 
24 communication and coordination in daily activities as well as in long-range planning are 
25 possible to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all 3 branches without the 
26 imposition of the views or directions of one or 2 branches upon another. The Legislature 
27 finds that active participation by the executive branch in the lawmaking process is 
28 essential to producing informed and effective legislation. The Legislature finds that the 
29 Constitution of Maine, Articles IV and V provide for shared participation in the 
30 lawmaking process and that shared responsibility has long been recognized and respected. 
31 The Legislature finds that a blanket policy by the executive branch that severely limits 
32 executive branch engagement and participation in the legislative process is contrary to 
33 these fundamental understandings and intentions underlying the Constitution of Maine 
34 and that the Governor should provide reasonably accessible information and expertise 
35 when the Legislature reasonably so requests.'
