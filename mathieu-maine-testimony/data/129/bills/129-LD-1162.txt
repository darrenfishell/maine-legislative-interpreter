13SUMMARY
14This bill requires that, if a prescription drug has a wholesale acquisition cost of more 
15than $40 for a course of therapy and there is an increase in the wholesale acquisition cost 
16of that prescription drug of more than 16%, including the proposed increase and the 
17cumulative increases that occurred within the previous two calendar years prior to the 
18current year, the manufacturer of the prescription drug must provide notice to certain 
19registered purchasers.
20Under current law the Maine Health Data Organization, referred to as the 
21"organization," is required to collect and report information with regard to the 25 
22prescription drugs that are the most frequently prescribed in the State, the 25 costliest as 
23determined by the total amount spent on those drugs in the State and the 25 drugs that 
24have the highest year-over-year cost increases in total spending in the State.  This bill 
25requires the organization to post online a list of the identified prescription drugs, along 
26with the corresponding wholesale acquisition cost and the percentage of wholesale 
27acquisition cost increase, if applicable, for each identified prescription drug.
28The bill directs the organization to develop a plan to collect data from manufacturers 
29that will help explain how prescription drug prices are established.  The organization is 
30required to work with other state and national agencies and organizations to determine 
31how to conduct the data collection.  The organization is required to submit the plan as 
32well as any recommendations for legislation to the joint standing committee of the 
33Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters by April 1, 2020.  That committee 
34may report out legislation to the First or Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.
35Using the plan developed and reported to the Legislature, starting in 2021 the 
36organization must require the manufacturer of each drug on the list to disclose drug 
37production, research and development costs, marketing and advertising costs and actual 
38costs paid by purchasers.  The manufacturer must certify the accuracy of the information 
39and provide it within 60 days after the information is requested by the organization.  The 
Page 6 - 129LR0786(01)-11organization is authorized to request additional information related to the required 
2information.
3The information that the manufacturers are directed to provide to the organization, 
4unless the information is already publicly accessible or available or previously released in 
5the public domain, must be held confidential at the request of the manufacturer. The 
6organization may release information that was previously accessible or available or 
7released in the public domain.  The organization may release additional information as 
8long as the information released is not a trade secret.  The organization must treat the 
9information as "Level II" information as required by rules that have already been adopted 
10by the organization.
11This amendment provides that the manufacturer may voluntarily provide any other 
12information the manufacturer determines relevant to the increase in wholesale acquisition 
13cost, including but not limited to information about all manufacturer-sponsored assistance 
14programs for that drug in the previous year, including the terms of the programs, the total 
15amount of financial assistance provided to residents of the State and the average amount 
16of assistance per resident of the State for whom assistance was provided.  This 
17information is not considered confidential and the organization may release it, identifying 
18both the manufacturer and the individual drug.
19The organization is required to submit an annual report to the Legislature based on 
20the list of up to 75 drugs and the wholesale acquisition cost information.  The 
21organization may include in the report recommendations for increasing prescription drug 
22pricing transparency.  Once the organization starts collecting information from 
23manufacturers in 2021, the report must also include at least a summary of the 
24manufacturer information.  The organization is required to post the report online.
25The bill provides that when a manufacturer violates the reporting requirements, the 
26Board of Directors of the Maine Health Data Organization may impose a fine of not more 
27than $10,000 per day after the deadline for reporting required information.  If the 
28manufacturer fails to pay a fine, or if an injunction is necessary, the board may refer the 
29matter to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General may bring an action in Superior 
30Court for injunctive relief, enforcement of fines, costs, attorney's fees and any other 
31appropriate remedy.
32The legislation does not restrict the legal ability of a prescription drug manufacturer 
33to change prices to the extent permitted under federal law.
