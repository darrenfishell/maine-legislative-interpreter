Sec. 3. 25 MRSA §2804-C, sub-§2-E is enacted to read: 
2-E. Training regarding bias-based profiling. The board shall include in the basic 
law enforcement training program a block of instruction aimed specifically at the

SUMMARY 
The bill prohibits profiling on the basis of actual or perceived race, gender, ethnicity, 
religion, socioeconomic status, ancestry or national origin by law enforcement and 
requires data collection to provide information about whether profiling is occurring and, 
if so, the extent to which it is occurring. This amendment retains the prohibition on 
profiling on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
religion, socioeconomic status, age, national origin or ancestry by requiring the 
establishment of anti-profiling policies but removes the data collection requirement and 
instead directs the Attorney General to explore data collection techniques and report to 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary findings and recommendations by March 15, 
2020. The committee may report out legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 
129th Legislature. 
The amendment requires that training of law enforcement officers include anti­
profiling education and instruction. 
The amendment directs the Attorney General to establish procedures for receiving, 
investigating and responding to complaints alleging profiling by law enforcement officers 
or law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General may adopt rules to address the 
operation of administrative complaint procedures and independent audit programs to 
ensure that programs and procedures provide an appropriate response to allegations of 
profiling by law enforcement officers or law enforcement agencies.
