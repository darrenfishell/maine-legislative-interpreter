26This bill changes the date by which definitions of "subdivision" that are in municipal

28"subdivision" in state law.  It also extends the time municipalities have to register an 
29ordinance with a conflicting definition with the registry of deeds.  The bill also removes 
30cross-references to the site location of development laws in an exemption to municipal 
31subdivision review and adds a cross-reference to the law governing municipal site plan 
32review ordinances.
