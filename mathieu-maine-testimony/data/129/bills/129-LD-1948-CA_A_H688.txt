obtain the patient's infonned consent to that examination unless the examination of an 
unconscious patient is required for diagnostic purposes and is medically necessaty or the 
examination is authorized pursuant to the implied consent provision in the Maine Health 
Security Act relating to forensic examinations of unconscious alleged victims of sexual 
assault. 
The amendment clarifies that the provisions apply more broadly to licensed health 
care practitioners, not just physicians as in the bill, and reallocates the provision to the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24, chapter 21, subchapter 5. The amendment expands the 
scope of the bill to include rectal and prostate examinations and also requires a health 
care practitioner to obtain the patient's informed consent orally and in writing.
