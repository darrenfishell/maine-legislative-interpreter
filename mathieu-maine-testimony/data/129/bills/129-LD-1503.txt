12information from the relator.  Any information or documents furnished by the 
13relator to the Attorney General in connection with the initiation of a qui tam 
14action or investigation under subparagraph (2) are not public records and are 
15exempt from disclosure under Title 1, chapter 13.
16(5)  The Attorney General may, for good cause shown, move the court for 
17extensions of time during which the complaint remains under seal under 
18subparagraph (3) and during which the Attorney General may elect to intervene

20subparagraph must be supported by an affidavit or other submission in camera.

22extension ordered under subparagraph (5), the Attorney General shall:

30paragraph until after the complaint is unsealed and served on the defendant as 
31provided in the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 5.
32(8)  When a person brings an action as relator under this paragraph, a person 
33other than the Attorney General on behalf of the State may not intervene or bring 
34a related action based on the facts underlying the action while the action is 
35pending.
36C.  The rights of the parties to a qui tam action under this subsection are determined 
37under this paragraph.
38(1)  If the Attorney General elects not to intervene in and proceed with the action, 
39the relator has the right to conduct the action as plaintiff.
40(a)  At the request of the Attorney General, and upon payment by the 
41Attorney General of the cost of transcription, copying and mailing, the relator 
42shall serve on the Attorney General copies of all pleadings filed in the action.
Page 5 - 129LR1703(01)-11(b)  The court, upon the Attorney General's showing good cause and without 
2limiting the status and rights of the relator, may permit the Attorney General

7the Attorney General has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action

9as a party to the action, subject to the limitations of this subparagraph.
10(a)  The Attorney General may move to dismiss the action for good cause 
11shown notwithstanding the objections of the relator if the relator has been 
12notified by the Attorney General of the filing of the motion and the court has 
13provided the relator with an opportunity to oppose the motion and present 
14evidence at a hearing.
15(b)  The Attorney General may settle the action with the defendant 
16notwithstanding the objections of the relator if the court determines, after a 
17hearing at which the relator has had an opportunity to present evidence, that 
18the proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable under all of the 
19circumstances.
20(c)  Upon a showing by the Attorney General that unrestricted participation 
21during the course of the action by the relator would interfere with or unduly 
22delay the prosecution of the action by the Attorney General or would be 
23repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its 
24discretion, impose limitations on the participation of the relator, including but 
25not limited to:
26(i)  Limiting the number of witnesses the relator may call;
27(ii)  Limiting the length of the testimony of the witnesses called by the 
28relator; and
29(iii)  Limiting the relator's cross-examination of witnesses.
30(d)  Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during 
31the course of the action by the relator would be for purposes of harassment or 
32would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court 
33may limit the participation of the relator in the action.
34(3)  Whether or not the Attorney General intervenes in and proceeds with the 
35action, upon a showing by the Attorney General that certain actions of discovery 
36by the relator would interfere with the Attorney General's investigation or 
37prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court 
38may stay the discovery for a period of not more than 60 days.  A showing under 
39this subparagraph must be conducted in camera.  The court may extend a 60-day 
40stay granted under this subparagraph upon a further showing in camera that the 
41Attorney General has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings 
42with reasonable diligence and that the proposed discovery in the qui tam action 
43would interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.  
Page 6 - 129LR1703(01)-11A motion with regard to discovery in a qui tam action must be filed with the court 
2in accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 26 to 37, as 
3applicable.
4(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph B, the Attorney General may 
5elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the State, 
6including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil penalty.  If an 
7alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the relator has the same rights 
8in the proceeding as the relator would have had if the action had continued under 
9this subsection.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, a finding or conclusion is 
10final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the 
11State, if all time for filing appeals with respect to the finding or conclusion has 
12expired or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.
13D.  If the Attorney General intervenes in and proceeds with a qui tam action under 
14this subsection and a judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff or a settlement is 
15entered in the action, the court shall enter an order as follows.
16(1)  Except as provided in subparagraph (2), the court may award the relator at 
17least 15% but not more than 25% of the proceeds of the action or settlement of 
18the claim, depending on the extent to which the relator and the counsel for the 
19relator contributed to the prosecution of the action.  Any payment to the relator 
20under this subparagraph must be made from the proceeds.
21(2)  If the court finds that the action is based primarily on disclosures of specific 
22information, other than information provided by the relator, relating to allegations 
23or transactions specifically in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, in a 
24legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or investigation or from the 
25news media, the court may award the relator such sums as it considers 
26appropriate, but in no case more than 10% of the proceeds, taking into account 
27the significance of the information and the role of the relator in advancing the 
28case to litigation.  Any payment to the relator under this subparagraph must be 
29made from the proceeds.
30(3)  The court shall order payment of the reasonable expenses of the relator that 
31the court finds to be necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and 
32costs.  All expenses, fees and costs must be awarded against the defendant.
33E.  If the Attorney General does not intervene in and proceed with a qui tam action 
34under this subsection and a judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff or a 
35settlement is entered in the action, the court shall enter an order as follows.  The 
36relator must receive an amount that the court determines reasonable for causing to be 
37collected the fines and damages.  The amount must be at least 25% but not more than 
3830% of the proceeds of the action or settlement and must be paid out of the proceeds.  
39The relator must also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds 
40to be necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  All expenses, 
41fees and costs must be awarded against the defendant.
42F.  Whether or not the Attorney General intervenes in and proceeds with the action, 
43and whether or not a judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff or a settlement is 
44entered in the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a relator who 
Page 7 - 129LR1703(01)-11planned and initiated the violation of subsection 3 upon which the action was 
2brought, the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share 
3of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise receive under this 
4subsection.  The court shall take into account the role of the relator in advancing the 
5case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.  If the 
6relator is convicted of a crime arising from the role of the relator in the violation of 
7subsection 3, the relator must be dismissed from the qui tam action and may not 
8receive any share of the proceeds of the action.  Dismissal of the relator under this 
9paragraph does not prejudice the right of the State to continue the action as plaintiff.
10G.  If the State does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action 
11conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant the defendant's reasonable 
12attorney's fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds 
13that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly 
14vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.
15H.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no liability may be incurred by the 
16State, the department or the Attorney General for any expenses, attorney's fees or 
17other costs incurred by any person in bringing or defending an action under this 
18subsection.
19I.  All money collected from the defendant in an action under this subsection, with the 
20exception of money payable under this subsection to another person, must be paid to 
21the State Controller for credit to the Maine False Claims Act Fund under subsection 
228.
23J.  The following limitations apply to qui tam actions under this subsection.
24(1)  The court does not have jurisdiction over an action brought under paragraph 
25B against a member of the Legislature, a Judge of the District Court or a Justice 
26of the Superior Court or Supreme Judicial Court or an executive branch official 
27appointed by the Governor if the action is based on evidence or information 
28known to the State when the action was brought.
29(2)  The court does not have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or 
30present member of the Armed Forces of the United States against another 
31member of the Armed Forces arising out of that other member's service in the 
32Armed Forces.
33(3)  The court shall dismiss an action or claim under paragraph B, unless opposed 
34by the State, if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the 
35action or claim were publicly disclosed in a state criminal, civil or administrative 
36hearing in which the State or its agent is a party; in a federal congressional or 
37state legislative or other report, hearing or audit, investigation; or from the news 
38media unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing 
39the action is an original source of the information.
40For purposes of this subparagraph, "original source" means an individual either 
41who prior to a public disclosure has voluntarily disclosed to the State the 
42information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based or who has 
43knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed 
Page 8 - 129LR1703(01)-11allegations or transactions and has voluntarily provided the information to the 
2State before filing an action under paragraph B.
3(4)  A person may not bring an action under paragraph B if the action is based 
4upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an 
5administrative civil penalty proceeding in which the State is already a party.
6K.  An employee, contractor or agent who is discharged, demoted, suspended, 
7threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and 
8conditions of employment by the employer of the employee, contractor or agent 
9because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor or agent in furtherance of a 
10qui tam action brought or to be brought under this subsection or other efforts to stop 
11one or more violations of this section, including investigation for, initiation of, 
12testimony for or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this subsection, is 
13entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee, contractor or agent whole.  
14Relief under this paragraph includes reinstatement with the same seniority status that 
15the employee, contractor or agent would have had but for the discriminatory action, 2 
16times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay and compensation for any 
17special damages sustained as a result of the discriminatory action, including litigation 
18costs and reasonable attorney's fees.  An employee, contractor or agent may bring an 
19action in Superior Court in the county in which the employer is located or the county 
20of residence of the employee, contractor or agent.  An action may not be brought 
21more than 3 years after the last act of the employer that is alleged to violate this 
22paragraph.
235.  Limitation of actions; burden of proof.  The following provisions apply to an 
24action under subsection 4.
25A.  An action under subsection 4 may not be brought more than 6 years after the date 
26on which the violation was committed or more than 3 years after the date when facts 
27material to the cause of action are known or reasonably should have been known by 
28the state official charged with the responsibility to act in such circumstances but in no 
29event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed, 
30whichever occurs later.
31B.  If the Attorney General elects to intervene in and proceed with an action brought 
32under subsection 4, paragraph B, the Attorney General may file a complaint or amend 
33the complaint of a relator to clarify or add detail to the claims in which the Attorney 
34General is intervening on behalf of the State and to add any additional claims with 
35respect to which the Attorney General contends the State is entitled to relief.  For 
36statute of limitations purposes, any such Attorney General pleading relates back to 
37the filing date of the complaint of the relator who originally brought the action, to the 
38extent that the claim of the Attorney General on behalf of the State arises out of the 
39conduct, transactions or occurrences set forth or attempted to be set forth in the prior 
40complaint of the relator.
41C.  A civil action under subsection 4 may be brought for activity prior to the effective 
42date of this subsection if the limitations period set in paragraph A has not lapsed.
Page 9 - 129LR1703(01)-11D.  An action under subsection 4 may be brought by the relator in the county in 
2which the relator resides, in the county in which the defendant has its principal place 
3of business or in the Superior Court of Kennebec County.
4E.  In an action brought under subsection 4, the State or the relator is required to 
5prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a 
6preponderance of the evidence.
7F.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a guilty verdict rendered in a criminal 
8proceeding alleging false statements or fraud, whether upon a verdict after trial or 
9upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, estops the defendant from denying the 
10essential elements of the offense in an action brought under subsection 4 that involves 
11the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding.
126.  Civil investigatory demands.  In an investigation of a violation under subsection 
133, the provisions of Title 5, section 211 apply to civil investigatory demands and to the 
14examination of books, records, papers and memoranda of whatever nature and persons 
15having knowledge regarding those materials.  Any information obtained by means of a 
16civil investigatory demand in connection with an action or investigation under this section 
17may be shared with any relator if the Attorney General or a designee of the Attorney 
18General determines it is necessary as part of any false claims act investigation under this 
19Act.
207.  Applicable rules of civil procedure.  The Maine Rules of Civil Procedure apply 
21to all aspects of service, subpoena power, discovery and court procedure of an action filed 
22pursuant to subsection 4 unless inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
238.  Maine False Claims Act Fund.  There is established within the department the 
24Maine False Claims Act Fund.  If the Attorney General initiates an action under 
25subsection 4, paragraph A or intervenes in and proceeds with an action under subsection 
264, paragraph B, the Attorney General is entitled to receive a fixed 33% of the proceeds of 
27the action or settlement of the claim, which funds must be used to provide funding for 
28investigatory, enforcement and litigation expenses within the Office of the Attorney 
29General related to this section.  The remaining 67% of the proceeds of the action or 
30settlement must be returned to the State.  The Maine False Claims Act Fund is a 
31nonlapsing fund dedicated to the purposes of this section.
329.  Remedies under other laws; severability of provisions; liberality of legislative 
33construction; adoption of legislative history.  The remedies provided for in this section 
34are not exclusive and are in addition to any other remedies provided for under section 15, 
35in any other law or available under common law.  If any provision of this section or the 
36application thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the 
37remainder of the section and the application of the provision to other persons and 
38circumstances is not affected thereby.  This section must be liberally construed and 
39applied to promote the public interest.  This section also adopts the congressional intent 
40behind the federal False Claims Act, 31 United States Code, Sections 3729 to 3733, 
41including the federal False Claims Amendments Act of 1986.
42Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §1714-A, sub-§10, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 442, §2, is 
43amended to read:
Page 10 - 129LR1703(01)-1110.  No imposition of liability on other persons.  The department may not by any 
2means, including without limitation any rule or any contract or agreement with a 
3provider, impose liability for a debt under this section on any person other than the 
4provider notified of the debt pursuant to subsection 2 or a person subject to collection by 
5offset pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 5.  This subsection does not prohibit the 
6department from seeking recovery of civil penalties from any person as provided in 
7section 15 15-A.
