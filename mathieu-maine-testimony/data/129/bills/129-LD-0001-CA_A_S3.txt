10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
12 purpose of this amendment is to ensure that consumer protections related to health 
13 insurance coverage included in the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are 
14 codified in state law. 
15 In Part A, the amendment does the following. 
16 1. It makes clear that carriers in the individual, small group and large group markets 
17 must meet guaranteed issue requirements similar to those required by federal law. 
18 2. It makes clear that individual and group health plans may not impose any 
19 preexisting condition exclusion on an enrollee. The amendment does permit a carrier to 
20 restrict enrollment in individual health plans to open enrollment and special enrollment 
21 periods established in rule. 
22 3. It clarifies that carriers offering individual or group health plans may not establish 
23 lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits unless the plan is grandfathered 
24 under the federal Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019 and does not impose new 
25 limits or reduce existing limits. The amendment specifies that the provision prohibiting 
26 annual limits on the dollar value of benefits applies to the dollar value of essential health 
27 benefits. 
28 4. It allows children, until they attain 26 years of age, to remain on their parents' 
29 health insurance policy. 
30 5. It changes the maximum rate differential due to age that may be filed by the 
31 carrier to 3 to 1 and requires that rates that vary based on age do so according to a 
32 uniform age rating curve. 
33 6. It provides that if a carrier varies premium rates based on family membership, the 
34 premium rate must equal the sum of the premiums for each individual in the family. 
35 7. It prohibits a carrier from varying premium rates based on tobacco use for 
36 individuals who are enrolled in an evidence-based tobacco cessation program approved 
37 by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug 
38 Administration. 
39 8. It makes clear that the minimum medical loss ratio in the individual market is 80% 
40 without exception.

9. It adds language to prohibit rescissions of coverage consistent with requirements 
2 under federal law. 
3 10. It makes changes to the timelines and requirements for determinations by a 
4 carrier of coverage for prescription drugs consistent with federal law. 
5 11. It requires carriers to provide information about the health plans offered by the 
6 carrier in a standardized manner that is substantially similar to the manner required for 
7 health plans subject to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as of 
8 January 1, 2019. 
9 12. It removes a provision of the bill that would have repealed the authority for 
1 O certain individuals to purchase coverage under an individual, nonrenewable short-term 
11 policy. 
12 13. It prohibits a health plan from reducing or terminating benefits for an ongoing 
13 course of treatment, including coverage of a prescription drug, during the course of an 
14 appeal of a determination of coverage. 
15 Part B requires that, at a minimum, individual and small group health plans cover 
16 essential health benefits that are substantially similar to those benefits required for health 
17 plans subject to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 
18 2019. The amendment also requires that health plans meet annual limits on cost sharing 
19 that are substantially similar to those benefits required for health plans subject to the 
20 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019. The 
21 amendment removes provisions of the bill that authorized the Superintendent of 
22 Insurance to make changes to essential health benefits and cost sharing limits in rule. The 
23 amendment clarifies that pediatric dental benefits may not be required of all individual 
24 and small group plans if dental coverage is available in accordance with the federal 
25 Affordable Care Act as in effect as of January 1, 2019. 
26 Part C adopts nondiscrimination provisions consistent with similar requirements in 
27 federal law and rule. 
28 Part D makes changes to current requirements in state law related to mental health 
29 parity consistent with similar requirements in federal law and regulations.
