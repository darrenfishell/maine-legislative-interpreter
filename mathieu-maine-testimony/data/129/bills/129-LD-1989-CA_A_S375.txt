9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " A " to S.P. 691, L.D. 1989, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend the Laws Governing Recounts in Municipal Elections" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
12 following: 
13 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
14 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
15 Whereas, this legislation corrects an error in Public Law 2019, chapter 288, An Act 
16 To Clarify Recounts in Municipal Elections, by expanding the recount process created in 
17 that law to all elections for municipal office, not just to the election of a municipal 
18 officer; and 
19 Whereas, delay in the effective date of this legislation will mean that the municipal 
20 recount process for upcoming municipal elections will apply to some but not all of the 
21 elected persons; and 
22 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
23 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
24 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
25 therefore, 1 
26 Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
27 'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
28 legislation takes effect when approved.' 
29 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
30 section number to read consecutively. 
31 SUMMARY
