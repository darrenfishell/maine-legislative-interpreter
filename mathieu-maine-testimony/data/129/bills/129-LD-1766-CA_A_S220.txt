Objectives" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 10 MRSA §1415-G, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 300, §2, is 
repealed and the following enacted in its place: 
1. Residential construction, remodeling and renovation. During the construction, 
remodeling or renovation of a multifamily residential structure, a person may not install 
electric resistance space heating equipment as the primary heating system if that 
construction, remodeling or renovation is funded in whole or in part by public funds, 
guarantees or bond proceeds unless: 
A. The person obtains a waiver from the commission in accordance with subsection 
2; or 
B. The structure meets a standard for calculated heat load established by the 
commission by rule or order. 
For purposes of this section, "multifamily residential structure" means a residential 
structure with more than one dwelling unit and "electric resistance space heating 
equipment" does not include electric thermal storage space heating equipment, a 
high-performance air source heat pump that satisfies minimum heating performance 
standards of the Efficiency Maine Trust or a geothermal heat pump.'

Fiscal Note 
Resources dedicated to heat pumps 
The bill establishes a state goal to install 100,000 new high-performance air source heat pumps and allows the 
Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT) to credit revenue it receives from the ISO-New England Forward Capacity Market to 
the Heating Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund to promote the pumps. This change to the distribution of funds 
dedicated to programs within the EMT will not change the overall level of expenditures by the EMT. 
Additional costs to the Maine State Housing Authority and the Public Utilities Commission associated with the 
requirements of this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
