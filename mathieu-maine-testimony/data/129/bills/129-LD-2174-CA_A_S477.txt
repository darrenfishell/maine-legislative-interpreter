9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 790, L.D. 2174, “An Act To Extend the 
10 Ability of Restaurants and Bars To Serve Alcohol To Go”
11 Amend the bill in section 1 in §1056 in subsection 1 in paragraph E in subparagraph 
12 (2) in the last line (page 2, line 14 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "operates a tasting 
13 room" and inserting the following: 'serves samples of its products to the public for on-
14 premises consumption or sells its products to the public for off-premises consumption as 
15 authorized by section 1355-A, subsection 2'
16 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
17 number to read consecutively.
18SUMMARY
19 This amendment removes the phrase "tasting room" from the bill because that phrase 
20 is not used elsewhere in the State's liquor laws and instead provides a description of the 
21 activity.
