Page 2 - 129LR1664(01)-11A.  The department shall develop the dental incentive payment program by rule.  The 
2dental incentive payment program must reward dentists who significantly increase

8established in section 3174-T.
9B.  Annually, the department shall establish a dental access benchmark against which 
10progress in increasing access to dental care for MaineCare members through the 
11incentive payment program is measured.
12C.  Beginning in fiscal year 2021-22 and annually thereafter, the department shall 
13review the effectiveness of the dental incentive payment program in meeting the 
14benchmarks established pursuant to paragraph B.  If the program fails to meet the 
15established benchmarks, the department shall:

17incentive payment program that will better ensure effectiveness in increasing 
18access to dental care for MaineCare members.  The working group must consist 
19of members representing MaineCare members, a statewide dental association, a 
20statewide dental hygienists association, a statewide primary care association and 
21other persons with policy expertise or experience in promoting access to dental 
22care for individuals with low incomes; and
23(2)  Adopt rules to restructure the dental incentive payment program.  When 
24adopting rules, the department shall consider the recommendations of the 
25working group pursuant to subparagraph (1) and the department's experience with 
26the dental incentive payment program and the experience of other states with 
27similar programs.
28D.  The department shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules adopted

35consider recommendations provided by a working group pursuant to subsection 2.

37pursuant to subsection 1 to implement provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, 
38section 3174-U, subsection 2, the Department of Health and Human Services shall 
39convene a working group to make recommendations to the department for the design of a 
40dental incentive payment program that will significantly increase the number of 
41MaineCare members that become patients of dental providers or for dentists that provide 
42dental services to a disproportionate number of MaineCare members.  The working group 
43must consist of members representing MaineCare members, a statewide dental 
Page 3 - 129LR1664(01)-11association, a statewide dental hygienists association, a statewide primary care 
2association and other persons with policy expertise or experience in promoting access to 
3dental care for individuals with low incomes.
