36which the organization was convicted of the crime to determine, collect and distribute 
37damages to persons in the class that the statute was designed to protect who suffered 
38injuries by reason of the crime, if the court finds that the multiplicity of small claims or 
39other circumstances make restitution by individual suit impractical.  Such supplementary 
40proceedings must be pursuant to rules adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court for this 
41purpose.  The court in which proceedings authorized by this subsection are commenced 
42may order the State to make available to the attorney appointed to institute such

18firearm.
192.  Prohibited forfeiture.  Except as provided in subsection 3, a court may not order 
20the forfeiture of a firearm otherwise qualifying for forfeiture under subsection 1 if, prior 
21to the imposition of the person's sentence:
22A.  For a crime other than murder or any other unlawful homicide crime, another 
23person satisfies the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the other person, at 
24the time of the commission of the crime, had a right to possess the firearm to the 
25exclusion of the convicted person; or
26B.  For the crime of murder or any other unlawful homicide crime, another person 
27satisfies the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the other person, at the

29had been stolen and the other person was not a principal or accomplice in the 
30commission of the crime.
313.  Exceptions to prohibited forfeiture.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, paragraph 
32A, the court shall order the forfeiture of a firearm even if another person meets the

34possessing a firearm in violation of Title 15, section 393 and, prior to the imposition of 
35the person's sentence, the State satisfies the court by a preponderance of the evidence that 
36the other person:
37A.  Knew or should have known that the convicted person was prohibited from 
38owning, possessing or controlling a firearm under Title 15, section 393; and 
Page 6 - 129LR0229(01)-11B.  Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly allowed the convicted person to possess or 
2have under the convicted person's control the firearm.
34.  Disposition of forfeited firearms.  The Attorney General shall adopt rules 
4governing the disposition to state, county and municipal agencies of firearms forfeited 
5under this section.  A firearm used during a murder or other unlawful homicide crime that 
6does not meet the prohibition from forfeiture under subsection 2, paragraph B must be 
7destroyed by the State.

9SENTENCES OF IMPRISONMENT
10§1601.  Definite term of imprisonment required
11In imposing a sentencing alternative pursuant to section 1502 that includes a term of 
12imprisonment, the court shall set a definite term of imprisonment.
13§1602.  Sentencing procedure
141.  Class A, Class B or Class C crimes.  In imposing a sentencing alternative 
15pursuant to section 1502 that includes a term of imprisonment for a Class A, Class B or 
16Class C crime, in setting the appropriate length of that term as well as any unsuspended 
17portion of that term accompanied by a period of probation or administrative release, the 
18court shall employ the following 3-step process.
19A.  First, the court shall determine a basic term of imprisonment by considering the 
20particular nature and seriousness of the offense as committed by the individual.
21B.  Second, the court shall determine the maximum term of imprisonment to be 
22imposed by considering all other relevant sentencing factors, both aggravating and 
23mitigating, appropriate to the case.  Relevant sentencing factors include, but are not 
24limited to, the character of the individual, the individual's criminal history, the effect 
25of the offense on the victim and the protection of the public interest.
26C.  Third, the court shall determine what portion, if any, of the maximum term of 
27imprisonment under paragraph B should be suspended and, if a suspension order is to 
28be entered, determine the appropriate period of probation or administrative release to 
29accompany that suspension.
302.  Crime of murder.  In imposing a sentence pursuant to section 1603 for the crime 
31of murder, the court shall employ only the first 2 steps of the sentencing process as 
32specified in subsection 1, paragraphs A and B.
333.  Imposition of supervised release after imprisonment for violation of gross 
34sexual assault.  When the court imposes a period of supervised release after 
35imprisonment for a violation of section 253, subsection 1, paragraph C as required by 
36section 1881, subsection 1 or chooses to impose a period of supervised release after 
37imprisonment for any other violation of section 253, as authorized by section 1881, 
38subsection 2, the court, after employing the first 2 steps of the sentencing process as 
Page 7 - 129LR0229(01)-11specified in subsection 1, paragraphs A and B, shall determine the appropriate period of 
2supervised release to follow the maximum term of imprisonment.
3§1603.  Imprisonment for crime of murder
41.  Sentence.  A person convicted of the crime of murder must be sentenced to 
5imprisonment for life or for any term of years that is not less than 25.  The sentence of the 
6court must specify the length of the sentence to be served and must commit the person to 
7the Department of Corrections.
82.  Factors of domestic violence or victim's age or pregnancy.  In setting a term of 
9imprisonment pursuant to subsection 1, the court shall assign special weight to each of 
10the following 3 factors as they relate to the sentencing procedure in section 1602, 
11subsection 2:
12A.  That the victim is a child who had not in fact attained 6 years of age at the time 
13the crime was committed;
14B.  That the victim is a woman whom the convicted individual knew or had 
15reasonable cause to believe to be in fact pregnant at the time the crime was 
16committed; and
17C.  That the victim is a family or household member as defined in Title 19-A, section 
184002, subsection 4 who is a victim of domestic violence committed by the convicted 
19individual.
20This subsection may not be construed to restrict a court in setting a term of imprisonment 
21from considering the age of the victim in other circumstances when relevant.
22§1604.  Imprisonment for crimes other than murder
231.  Maximum terms of imprisonment dependent on crime class.  Unless a 
24different maximum term of imprisonment is specified by statute, the maximum term of 
25imprisonment is as follows:
26A.  In the case of a Class A crime, 30 years;
27B.  In the case of a Class B crime, 10 years;
28C.  In the case of a Class C crime, 5 years;
29D.  In the case of a Class D crime, less than one year; or
30E.  In the case of a Class E crime, 6 months.
312.  Exceptions to maximum term of imprisonment based on crime class.  
32Notwithstanding subsection 1:
33A.  In the case of the Class A crime of aggravated attempted murder, the court shall 
34set a term of imprisonment under section 152-A, subsection 2 of life or a definite 
35period of any term of years;
Page 8 - 129LR0229(01)-11B.  If the State pleads and proves that the defendant is a repeat sexual assault 
2offender, the court may set a definite term of imprisonment under section 253-A, 
3subsection 1 for any term of years; and
4C.  In the case of the Class A crime of gross sexual assault against an individual who 
5had not yet attained 12 years of age, the court shall set a definite term of 
6imprisonment under section 253-A, subsection 2 for any term of years.
73.  Mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for crime with use of firearm 
8against an individual.  If the State pleads and proves that a Class A, B or C crime was 
9committed with the use of a firearm against an individual, the minimum sentence of 
10imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows:
11A.  In the case of a Class A crime, 4 years;
12B.  In the case of a Class B crime, 2 years; and
13C.  In the case of a Class C crime, one year.
14For purposes of this subsection, the applicable sentencing class is determined in 
15accordance with subsection 5, paragraph A.
16This subsection does not apply if the State pleads and proves criminal threatening or 
17attempted criminal threatening, as defined in section 209, or terrorizing or attempted 
18terrorizing, as defined in section 210, subsection 1, paragraph A.
194.  Mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for certain drug crimes.  For 
20an individual convicted of violating section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D or 1118-A, 
21except as otherwise provided in section 1125, subsections 2 and 3, the court shall impose 
22a minimum sentence of imprisonment, which may not be suspended, as provided in 
23section 1125, subsection 1.
245.  Circumstances elevating class of crime.  The following circumstances elevate 
25the class of a crime.
26A.  If the State pleads and proves that a Class B, C, D or E crime was committed with 
27the use of a dangerous weapon, then the sentencing class for such crime is one class 
28higher than it would otherwise be. In the case of a Class A crime committed with the 
29use of a dangerous weapon, such use must be assigned special weight by the court in 
30exercising its sentencing discretion. This paragraph does not apply to a violation or 
31an attempted violation of section 208, to any other offenses to which use of a 
32dangerous weapon serves as an element or to any offense for which the sentencing 
33class is otherwise elevated because the actor or an accomplice to that actor's or 
34accomplice's knowledge was armed with a firearm or other dangerous weapon.
35B.  If the State pleads and proves that, at the time any crime, excluding murder, under 
36chapter 9, 11, 12, 13, 27 or 35, excluding section 853-A; section 402-A, subsection 1, 
37paragraph A; or section 752-A or 752-C was committed, or an attempt of any such 
38crime was committed, the individual had 2 or more prior convictions under chapter 9, 
3911,12, 13, 27 or 35, excluding section 853-A; section 402-A, subsection 1, paragraph 
40A; or section 752-A or 752-C, or for an attempt of any such crime, or for engaging in 
Page 9 - 129LR0229(01)-11substantially similar conduct in another jurisdiction, the sentencing class for the 
2crime is one class higher than it would otherwise be.
3(1)  In the case of a Class A crime, the sentencing class is not elevated, but the 
4prior record must be assigned special weight by the court when imposing a 
5sentence.
6(2)  Section 9-A governs the use of prior convictions when determining a 
7sentence, except that, for the purposes of this paragraph, for violations under 
8chapter 11, the dates of prior convictions may have occurred at any time.
9This paragraph does not apply to section 210-A if the prior convictions have already 
10served to elevate the sentencing class under section 210-A, subsection 1, paragraph C 
11or E or any other offense in which prior convictions have already served to elevate 
12the sentencing class.
13C.  The sentencing class for a crime that is pled and proved and is subject to elevation 
14pursuant to both paragraphs A and B may be elevated successively pursuant to both 
15of those paragraphs if the crime that is pled and proved contains different class 
16elevation factors.
176.  Special weight required for certain aggravating sentencing factors pleaded 
18and proved.  In exercising its sentencing discretion, a court shall assign special weight to 
19the following aggravating sentencing factors pleaded and proved by the State:
20A.  In the case of Class A gross sexual assault, the aggravating sentencing factor 
21specified in section 253-A, subsection 3, paragraph A;
22B.  In the case of gross sexual assault in violation of section 253, subsection 1 or 
23section 253, subsection 2, the aggravating sentencing factor specified in section 
24253-A, subsection 3, paragraph B; and 
25C.  In the case of sexual exploitation of a minor, the aggravating sentencing factor 
26specified in section 282, subsection 3.
277.  Special weight required for certain aggravating sentencing factors found 
28present by court.  In exercising its sentencing discretion, the court shall assign special 
29weight to the following aggravating sentencing factors if found by the court.
30A.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 
31individual convicted of aggravated attempted murder, attempted murder, 
32manslaughter, elevated aggravated assault or aggravated assault of a child who had 
33not in fact attained 6 years of age at the time the crime was committed, the court shall 
34assign special weight to this objective fact in determining the basic term of 
35imprisonment as the first step in the sentencing process specified in section 1602, 
36subsection 1, paragraph A.  The court shall assign special weight to any subjective 
37victim impact in determining the maximum term of incarceration in the 2nd step in 
38the sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph B.  The 
39court may not suspend that portion of the maximum term of imprisonment based on 
40objective or subjective victim impact in arriving at the final sentence as the 3rd and 
41final step in the sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph 
Page 10 - 129LR0229(01)-11C.  This paragraph may not be construed to restrict a court in setting a sentence from 
2considering the age of the victim in other circumstances when relevant.
3B.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 
4individual convicted of aggravated attempted murder, attempted murder, 
5manslaughter, elevated aggravated assault or aggravated assault of a woman who the 
6convicted individual knew or had reasonable cause to believe to be in fact pregnant at 
7the time the crime was committed, the court shall assign special weight to this fact in 
8determining the basic term of imprisonment as the first step in the sentencing process 
9specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph A.  The court shall assign special 
10weight to any subjective victim impact in determining the maximum term of 
11incarceration in the 2nd step in the sentencing process specified in section 1602, 
12subsection 1, paragraph B.  The court may not suspend that portion of the maximum 
13term of imprisonment based on objective or subjective victim impact in arriving at 
14the final sentence as the 3rd and final step in the sentencing process specified in 
15section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph C.  This paragraph may not be construed to 
16restrict a court in setting a sentence from considering the fact that the victim was 
17pregnant in other circumstances when relevant.
18C.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 
19individual convicted of a Class C or higher crime, the victim of which was at the time 
20of the commission of the crime in fact being stalked by that individual, the court shall 
21assign special weight to this objective fact in determining the basic sentence in the 
22first step of the sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph 
23A.  The court shall assign special weight to any subjective victim impact caused by 
24the stalking in determining the maximum term of incarceration in the 2nd step in the 
25sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph B.
26§1605.  Suspension of all or part of the term of imprisonment imposed
27Unless the law that the individual is convicted of violating expressly provides that an 
28authorized term of imprisonment may not be suspended, if the individual is eligible for 
29probation as authorized by chapter 67, subchapter 1 or administrative release as 
30authorized by chapter 67, subchapter 2, a sentencing court may suspend the authorized 
31term of imprisonment in whole or in part and accompany the suspension with a period of 
32probation, which may not exceed the maximum period of probation authorized for the 
33crime pursuant to section 1804, or a period of administrative release, which may not 
34exceed one year.
35§1606.  General inapplicability of deductions under chapter 81 in setting the term of 
36imprisonment
37If a court imposes a sentencing alternative pursuant to section 1502 that includes a 
38term of imprisonment, in setting the appropriate length of that term, as well as an 
39unsuspended portion of that term, if any, the court may not consider the potential impact 
40of deductions under chapter 81 except in the context of a plea agreement in which both 
41parties are recommending to the court a particular disposition under the Maine Rules of 
42Unified Criminal Procedure, Rule 11-A.
Page 11 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1607.  Prohibition against imprisonment based on incapacity to pay fine
2If a court finds that an individual has met the burden of proving incapacity to pay a 
3fine pursuant to section 1702, subsection 2, the court may not impose a term of 
4imprisonment or any other sentencing alternative involving imprisonment solely for the 
5reason that the individual does not have the present or future capacity to pay the fine.
6§1608.  Multiple sentences of imprisonment
71.  Court to state whether sentence is served concurrently or consecutively; 
8consecutive sentence contingent upon certain factors.  The court shall state in the 
9sentence of imprisonment whether a sentence must be served concurrently with or 
10consecutively to any other sentence previously imposed or to another sentence imposed 
11on the same date. The sentences must be concurrent except that the court may impose the 
12sentences consecutively after considering the following factors:
13A.  The convictions are for offenses based on different conduct or arising from 
14different criminal episodes;
15B.  The individual was under a previously imposed suspended or unsuspended 
16sentence and was on probation or administrative release, under incarceration or on a 
17release program or period of supervised release at the time the individual committed a 
18subsequent offense;
19C.  The individual had been released on bail when that individual committed a 
20subsequent offense, either pending trial of a previously committed offense or pending 
21the appeal of previous conviction; or
22D.  The seriousness of the criminal conduct involved in either a single criminal 
23episode or in multiple criminal episodes or the seriousness of the criminal record of 
24the individual, or both, require a sentence of imprisonment in excess of the maximum 
25available for the most serious offense.
262.  Limitations on imposition of consecutive terms for crimes in same criminal 
27episode.  An individual may not be sentenced to consecutive terms for crimes arising out 
28of the same criminal episode if:
29A.  One crime is an included crime of the other;
30B.  One crime consists only of a conspiracy, attempt, solicitation or other form of 
31preparation to commit, or facilitation of, the other;
32C.  The crimes differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of 
33conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of that conduct; or
34D.  Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the 
35crimes.
363.  Reason for consecutive sentences must be stated.  If the court decides to impose 
37consecutive sentences, the court shall state its reasons for doing so on the record or in the 
38sentences.
Page 12 - 129LR0229(01)-114.  When new sentence is to be served consecutively for individual on probation, 
2administrative release or supervised release.  If an individual has been placed on 
3probation, administrative release or supervised release pursuant to a previously imposed 
4sentence and the court determines that the previously imposed sentence and a new 
5sentence must be served consecutively, the court shall revoke probation or administrative 
6release pursuant to section 1812, subsections 5 and 6 or terminate supervised release 
7pursuant to section 1881, subsection 6.  The court may order that the sentence that had 
8been suspended be served at the same institution as that which is specified by the new 
9sentence.
105.  Mandatory resentencing following discovery of previously imposed sentence.  
11If it is discovered subsequent to the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment that the 
12sentencing court was unaware of a previously imposed sentence of imprisonment that is 
13not fully discharged, the court shall resentence the individual and shall specify whether 
14the sentences are to be served concurrently or consecutively.
156.  Special requirements for individual previously sentenced in another 
16jurisdiction.  If an individual who has been previously sentenced in another jurisdiction 
17has not commenced or completed that sentence, the court may, with consideration of the 
18factors stated in subsection 1, sentence the individual to a term of imprisonment that must 
19be treated as a concurrent sentence from the date of sentencing although the individual is 
20incarcerated in an institution of the other jurisdiction.  A concurrent sentence pursuant to 
21this subsection may not be imposed unless the individual being sentenced consents or 
22unless the individual being sentenced executes, at the time of sentencing, a written waiver 
23of extradition for that individual's return to this State, upon completion of the sentence of 
24the other jurisdiction, if any portion of this State's sentence remains unserved.  In the 
25absence of an order pursuant to this subsection requiring concurrent sentences, any 
26sentence of imprisonment in this State commences as provided in section 2303, 
27subsections 1 and 2 and runs consecutively to the sentence of the other jurisdiction.
287.  Sentencing subsequent to probation, administrative release or supervised 
29release.  A court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment, not wholly suspended, to 
30be served consecutively to any split sentence, or to any sentence including supervised 
31release under chapter 67, subchapter 3, previously imposed or imposed on the same date, 
32if the net result, even with the options made available by subsections 4 and 8, section 
331804, subsection 12, section 1852, subsection 5 and section 1881, subsection 6, would be 
34to have the individual released from physical confinement to be on probation, 
35administrative release or supervised release for the first sentence and thereafter be 
36required to serve an unsuspended term of imprisonment on the 2nd sentence.
378.  Rearrangement of order of sentences.  A court imposing a sentence of 
38imprisonment to be served consecutively to any other previously imposed sentence that 
39the individual has not yet commenced, in order to comply with subsection 7, may 
40rearrange the order in which the sentences are to be served.
Page 13 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1609.  Nonconcurrent sentence for crime attempted or committed while in 
2execution of term of imprisonment
3Notwithstanding section 1608, when an individual subject to an undischarged term of 
4imprisonment is convicted of a crime committed while in execution of any term of 
5imprisonment or of an attempt to commit a crime while in execution of any term of 
6imprisonment, the sentence is not concurrent with any undischarged term of 
7imprisonment.  The court may order that any undischarged term of imprisonment be 
8tolled and service of the nonconcurrent sentence commence immediately and the court 
9shall so order if any undischarged term of imprisonment is a split sentence.  No portion of 
10the nonconcurrent sentence may be suspended.  Any sentence that the convicted 
11individual receives as a result of the conviction of a crime or attempt to commit a crime 
12while in execution of a term of imprisonment must be nonconcurrent with all other 
13sentences.
14This section applies to prisoners on supervised community confinement pursuant to 
15Title 34-A, section 3036-A.
16§1610.  Place of imprisonment
171.  Class D or Class E crimes.  The court shall specify a county jail as the place of 
18imprisonment for an individual convicted of a Class D or Class E crime, except that, if a 
19sentence to a term of imprisonment in a county jail is consecutive to or is to be followed 
20by a sentence to a term of imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections, 
21the court imposing either sentence may order that both be served in the custody of the 
22Department of Corrections.  If a court imposes consecutive terms of imprisonment for 
23Class D or Class E crimes and the aggregate length of the terms imposed is one year or 
24more, the court may order that they be served in the custody of the Department of 
25Corrections.
262.  Class A, Class B or Class C crimes.  For an individual convicted of a Class A, 
27Class B or Class C crime the court shall:
28A.  Specify a county jail as the place of imprisonment if the term of imprisonment is 
299 months or less; or
30B.  Commit the individual to the Department of Corrections if the term of 
31imprisonment is more than 9 months.
323.  Intermittent service of county jail sentence.  At the request of or with the 
33consent of a convicted individual, the court may order a sentence of imprisonment under 
34this chapter in a county jail, a sentence of probation involving imprisonment in a county 
35jail under chapter 67, subchapter 1 or a sentence of administrative release involving 
36imprisonment in a county jail under chapter 67, subchapter 2 to be served intermittently.
37§1611.  Commitments to Department of Corrections of bound-over juveniles who 
38have not attained 18 years of age at the time of sentencing
39A juvenile who has been bound over, pursuant to Title 15, section 3101, subsection 4, 
40who is subsequently, as to the juvenile crime's adult counterpart, convicted and sentenced 
Page 14 - 129LR0229(01)-11to a sentencing alternative involving imprisonment and who has not attained 18 years of 
2age at the time of sentence imposition must be committed to a Department of Corrections 
3juvenile correctional facility for an indeterminate period not to extend beyond the 
4juvenile's 18th birthday to serve the term of imprisonment or any unsuspended portion 
5until discharge from the juvenile correctional facility, and once discharged the juvenile 
6must be transferred to a correctional facility in which adult individuals are confined to 
7serve out the remainder of the imprisonment term or unsuspended portion, if any.
8§1612.  Tolling of sentence of noncompliant witness
9In the event a witness in a grand jury or criminal proceeding has been ordered 
10confined by a court in the State as a remedial coercive sanction for refusing to comply 
11with an order of the court to testify or provide evidence, and that witness is already in 
12execution of an undischarged term of imprisonment on a sentence in the State, that court 
13may order that the undischarged term of imprisonment be tolled for the duration of the 
14coercive imprisonment.

16FINES, FEES, ASSESSMENTS AND SURCHARGES
17SUBCHAPTER 1
18FINES
19§1701.  Definite fine amount required
20In imposing a sentencing alternative pursuant to section 1502 that includes a fine, the 
21court shall set a specific amount of money.
22§1702.  Criteria for imposing sentencing alternative that includes fine
231.  Consideration of financial capacity to pay and financial burden.  In 
24determining the amount of a fine, unless the fine amount is mandatory, and in 
25determining the method of payment of a fine, the court shall take into account the present 
26and future financial capacity of the convicted person to pay the fine and the nature of the 
27financial burden that payment of the fine will impose on the person or a dependent, if 
28any, of the person.
292.  Burden of proving financial hardship or incapacity to pay.  A convicted 
30person who asserts a present or future incapacity to pay a fine or asserts that the fine will 
31cause an excessive financial hardship on the person or on a dependent of the person has 
32the burden of proving the incapacity or excessive hardship by a preponderance of the 
33evidence.  On appeal of a sentencing alternative involving a fine, the person has the 
34burden of demonstrating that the incapacity or excessive financial hardship was proven as 
35a matter of law.
Page 15 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1703.  Use of fine relative to individuals
2Except when specifically precluded, in choosing the appropriate punishment for an 
3individual convicted of a crime, the court shall consider the desirability of imposing a 
4sentencing alternative involving a fine either in conjunction with or in lieu of a sentencing 
5alternative involving imprisonment.  A sentencing alternative involving imprisonment 
6may not be imposed by a court solely for the reason that the individual does not have the 
7present or future financial capacity to pay a fine.
8§1704.  Maximum fine amounts authorized for convicted individuals
9An individual who has been convicted of a Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D or 
10Class E crime may be sentenced to pay a fine.  Except as provided in section 1706 and 
11unless a different maximum fine is specified by statute, the maximum fine that may be 
12imposed by a court on a convicted individual is as follows:
131.  Class A crime.  In the case of a Class A crime, $50,000;
142.  Class B crime.  In the case of a Class B crime, $20,000;
153.  Class C crime.  In the case of a Class C crime, $5,000;
164.  Class D crime.  In the case of a Class D crime, $2,000; and
175.  Class E crime.  In the case of a Class E crime, $1,000.
18§1705.  Maximum fine amounts authorized for convicted organizations
19An organization that has been convicted of murder or a Class A, Class B, Class C, 
20Class D or Class E crime may be sentenced to pay a fine.  Except as provided in section 
211706 and unless a different maximum fine is specified by statute, the maximum fine that 
22may be imposed by a court on a convicted organization is as follows:
231.  Crime of murder.  In the case of the crime of murder, any amount;
242.  Class A crime.  In the case of a Class A crime, $100,000;
253.  Class B crime.  In the case of a Class B crime, $40,000;
264.  Class C crime.  In the case of a Class C crime, $20,000; and
275.  Class D crime or Class E crime.  In the case of a Class D crime or a Class E 
28crime, $10,000.
29§1706.  Exceptions to maximum fine amounts
30Notwithstanding the maximum fine amounts specified in sections 1704 and 1705, a 
31court may impose fines as provided in this section.
321.  Pecuniary gain.  Regardless of the classification of the crime, the court may 
33impose a fine on a convicted person that is in an amount greater than the maximum fine 
Page 16 - 129LR0229(01)-11amounts specified in section 1704 for an individual and section 1705 for an organization 
2as long as the fine does not exceed twice the pecuniary gain derived from the crime by 
3the convicted person.  The State must plead and prove the amount of money or the value 
4of the property obtained by the person at the time of the commission of the crime.  At 
5sentencing, if the court is considering imposing a fine based upon pecuniary gain, it shall 
6hold a hearing in order to determine the pecuniary gain.  At the hearing the court shall 
7determine whether any money or property was returned to the victim of the crime or was 
8seized by or surrendered to a lawful authority prior to the time of sentencing, and shall 
9determine the value of any such property.  If the court finds that money or property was 
10returned, seized or surrendered, the court shall reduce the pecuniary gain pleaded and 
11proved by the State by the amount of money or the value of property returned, seized or 
12surrendered in order to arrive at the net amount of pecuniary gain upon which a fine may 
13be based pursuant to this subsection.  If the court determines that no money or property 
14was returned, seized or surrendered, the court shall base the fine on the amount pleaded 
15and proved by the State.
16As used in this subsection, "pecuniary gain" means the amount of money or the value of 
17property at the time of the commission of the crime derived by the person from the 
18commission of the crime.
192.  Fine based on quantity of item illegally possessed by convicted person.  
20Whenever a statute makes the possession of a particular item, whether animate or 
21inanimate, a criminal offense and provides that the amount of the fine depends upon the 
22quantity of the item possessed by the person, if the State pleads and proves the quantity of 
23the item possessed by the person, the fine is as provided for in the statute and is not 
24subject to the maximum limits placed on fines by sections 1704 and 1705.
253.  Fine based on value of scheduled drug at time of offense.  Whenever a statute 
26authorizes that the amount of the fine for a specific drug offense be based on the value of 
27the scheduled drug at the time of the offense upon which the conviction is based, if the 
28State pleads and proves the value of the scheduled drug at the time of the offense, the fine 
29may be as provided for in the statute and is not subject to the maximum limits placed on 
30fines by sections 1704 and 1705. 
31§1707.  Multiple fines imposed on convicted person
32When multiple fines are imposed on a convicted person at the same time or when a 
33fine is imposed on a convicted person already subject to an unpaid or partly unpaid fine, 
34the fines must be cumulative, unless the court specifies that only the highest single fine 
35must be paid in the case of offenses based on the same conduct or arising out of the same 
36criminal episode or for other good cause stated on the record or in the sentences.
37§1708.  Time and method of payment of fines imposed on convicted person
381.  Timing of fine payment.  If a convicted person is sentenced to pay a fine, the 
39court may grant permission for the payment to be made within a specified period of time 
40or in specified installments. If  such permission is not included in the sentence, the fine 
41must be paid immediately to the clerk of the court.
Page 17 - 129LR0229(01)-112.  Payment as condition of probation or administrative release.  If a convicted 
2person sentenced to pay a fine is also placed on probation or administrative release, the 
3court may make the payment of the fine a condition of probation or administrative 
4release.  In the case of probation, the court may order that the fine be paid to the 
5convicted person's probation officer.
6§1709.  Post-conviction relief invalidating conviction; potential return of fine 
7payments
8If, in any judicial proceeding following conviction, a court issues a final judgment 
9invalidating the conviction, the judgment may include an order that a fine payment or any 
10part of a fine payment that the convicted person paid pursuant to the sentence for that 
11conviction be returned to that person.
12§1710.  Modification of payment of fine
13If a convicted person who has been sentenced to pay a fine is in danger of default, 
14that person shall move the court for a modification of time or method of payment to avoid 
15a default.  The court may modify its prior order to allow additional time for payment or to 
16reduce the amount of each installment.
17§1711.  Default
181.  Return to court upon default.  A convicted person who has been sentenced to 
19pay a fine and who fails to pay part or all of that fine is in default and must be returned to 
20court to explain the failure to pay the fine.
212.  Court authorized to conduct default hearing.  A convicted person who has 
22defaulted on the payment of a fine and is required to be returned to a court pursuant to a 
23warrant may be returned to the court that issued the warrant or to the court having 
24jurisdiction over the area where the warrant was executed.  Either court is authorized to 
25conduct the default hearing pursuant to subsection 4.
26For purposes of this subsection, "convicted person" includes an individual or individuals 
27authorized to make disbursements from the assets of a convicted organization.
283.  Reporting of default; motion to revoke probation, revoke administrative 
29release or enforce payment.  A probation officer having knowledge of a default in 
30payment of a fine by a convicted person shall report the default to the office of the 
31attorney for the State.  An attorney for the State having knowledge of a default in 
32payment of a fine by a convicted person shall report the default to the court.  If the fine 
33was a condition of probation, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce 
34payment of the fine or, with the written consent of the probation officer, a motion to 
35revoke probation under section 1811.  If the fine was a requirement of administrative 
36release, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce payment of the fine or a 
37motion to revoke administrative release under section 1855.  If the fine was not a 
38condition of probation or a requirement of administrative release, the attorney for the 
39State may file a motion to enforce payment of the fine.
Page 18 - 129LR0229(01)-114.  Procedure for motion to enforce payment.  Either the attorney for the State or 
2the court may initiate a motion to enforce payment of a fine.  Notification for the hearing 
3on the motion must be sent by regular mail to the convicted person's last known address.  
4If the person does not appear for the hearing after proper notification has been sent, the 
5court may issue a bench warrant. A court need not bring a motion to enforce payment of a 
6fine nor notify the person by regular mail of the date of the hearing if at the time of 
7sentence imposition the court's order to pay the fine and accompanying warnings to the 
8person comply with Title 14, section 3141, subsection 3 or 4; in this case, if the person 
9fails to appear as directed by the court's fine order, the court may issue a bench warrant.
10A.  Unless the person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the default was 
11not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or to a 
12failure on the person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for 
13the payment, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and may:
14(1)  Commit the person to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 
15the fine is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcused default 
16must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 months.  A person 
17committed for nonpayment of a fine is given credit toward the payment of the 
18fine for each day of confinement that the person is in custody at the rate specified 
19in the court's order, which may not be less than $25 or more than $100 of unpaid 
20fine for each day of confinement.  The person is also given credit for each day 
21that the person is detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this 
22section.  A person is responsible for paying any fine remaining after receiving 
23credit for confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining fine is also 
24governed by this section; or
25(2)  If the unexcused default relates to a fine imposed for a Class C, Class D or 
26Class E crime, as authorized by this subchapter, order the person to perform a 
27specified number of hours of community service work for the benefit of the State, 
28a county, a municipality, a school administrative district or other public entity, a 
29charitable institution or other entity approved by the court until all or a specified 
30part of the fine is paid.  The number of hours of community service work must be 
31specified in the court's order and the person must receive a credit against the 
32unpaid fine at a rate equal to the current hourly minimum wage.  A person 
33ordered to perform community service work pursuant to this subparagraph is 
34given credit toward the payment of the fine for each 8-hour day of community 
35service work performed.  The person is also given credit toward the payment of 
36the fine for each day that the person is detained as a result of an arrest warrant 
37issued pursuant to this section at a rate specified in the court's order that is up to 
38$100 of unpaid fine per day of confinement.  A person who fails to complete the 
39work in the manner ordered by the court must be returned to the court to explain 
40the failure.  A person is responsible for paying any fine remaining after receiving 
41credit for any detention and for community service work performed.  A default 
42on the remaining fine is also governed by this section.
43The Department of Corrections is not responsible for supervision of community 
44service work performed pursuant to this subparagraph.
Page 19 - 129LR0229(01)-11B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the person additional 
2time for payment, may reduce the amount of each installment or may permit the 
3person to perform community service work at the rate authorized by paragraph A, 
4subparagraph (2), supervised by the sheriff of the county in which the court that 
5assessed the fine is located or by a community confinement monitoring agency with 
6which that sheriff has contracted under Title 30-A, section 1659-A.
7C.  If the court commits a person to the custody of the sheriff for nonpayment of a 
8fine pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the court may authorize, at the time 
9of its order only, participation of the person in a project under Title 30-A, section 
101606 with the agreement of the sheriff of the county jail where the person is 
11committed.  The person must be given credit according to Title 30-A, section 1606, 
12subsection 2.
13D.  The confinement ordered under paragraph A, subparagraph (1) must be 
14nonconcurrent with any judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.
155.  Levy of execution or other civil measures authorized; consequence of levy of 
16execution.  Upon any default, the court may order execution to be levied and may order 
17other measures authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments to be taken to 
18collect the unpaid fine.  A levy of execution does not discharge a convicted person 
19confined to a county jail or performing community service work under subsection 4 for 
20unexcused default until the full amount of the fine has been collected or credited.
216.  Payment of fine imposed on organization; consequence of failure.  When a 
22fine is imposed on an organization, the individual or individuals authorized to make 
23disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay the fine from the 
24organization's assets.  Failure to do so may subject the individual or individuals to court 
25action pursuant to this section.
26§1712.  Deposit of certain fines in Maine Military Family Relief Fund
27Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a person is convicted under 
28section 354, subsection 2, paragraph A of theft by deception due to that person's 
29intentional creation or reinforcement of a false impression that the person is a veteran or a 
30member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a state military force, any fine 
31imposed on that person by the court must be deposited in the Maine Military Family 
32Relief Fund established in Title 37-B, section 158.
33SUBCHAPTER 2
34FEES, ASSESSMENTS AND SURCHARGES
35§1751.  County jail reimbursement fee
361.  Assessment of reimbursement fee.  When an individual is sentenced to 
37incarceration in a county jail, the sentencing court shall consider and may assess as part 
38of the sentence a jail reimbursement fee, referred to in this section as "the reimbursement 
39fee," to help defray the expenses of the individual's room and board.
Page 20 - 129LR0229(01)-112.  Evidence.  The court, in determining whether a reimbursement fee as set out in 
2subsection 1 is to be assessed and in establishing the amount of that fee, shall consider 
3evidence relevant to the individual's ability to pay that fee, including, but not limited to, 
4the factors set forth in section 2005, subsection 2, paragraph D, subparagraphs (1) to (5).  
5The court may not consider as evidence the following:
6A.  Joint ownership, if any, that the individual may have in real property;
7B.  Joint ownership, if any, that the individual may have in any assets, earnings or 
8other sources of income; and
9C.  The income, assets, earnings or other property, both real and personal, owned by 
10the individual's spouse or family.
113.  Amount of reimbursement fee; collection.  After considering all relevant 
12evidence on the issue of the individual's ability to pay under subsection 2, the court may 
13enter, as part of its sentence, a reimbursement fee that must be paid by the individual for 
14incarceration in the county jail.  The reimbursement fee may not exceed the cost of 
15incarcerating the individual or $80 per day, whichever is less, and must bear a reasonable 
16relationship to the individual's ability to pay.  Upon petition by the individual, the amount 
17may be modified to reflect any changes in the financial status of the individual.
18Any reimbursement fee assessed must be collected by the county treasurer of the county 
19in which the individual is incarcerated, paid into the treasury of that county and credited 
20to the county responsible for paying for the incarceration of the individual.
214.  Timing of fee payment.  If an individual is sentenced to pay a reimbursement fee, 
22the court may allow the individual to pay the reimbursement fee within a specified time 
23or in specified installments.  If such permission is not contained in the sentence, the 
24reimbursement fee is payable immediately.
255.  Default.  An individual who has been sentenced to pay a reimbursement fee and 
26who fails to pay part or all of that fee is in default and must be returned to court to explain 
27the failure to pay that fee.
28A probation officer who knows of a default in payment of a reimbursement fee by an 
29individual shall report the default to the office of the attorney for the State or the attorney 
30for the county.  If the reimbursement fee was a condition of probation, the attorney for the 
31State or the attorney for the county may file a motion to enforce payment of the 
32reimbursement fee or, with the written consent of the probation officer, the attorney for 
33the State may file a motion to revoke probation under section 1811.  If the reimbursement 
34fee was a requirement of administrative release, the attorney for the State or the attorney 
35for the county may file a motion to enforce payment of the reimbursement fee or the 
36attorney for the State may file a motion to revoke administrative release under section 
371855.  If the reimbursement fee was not a condition of probation or a requirement of 
38administrative release, the attorney for the State or the attorney for the county may file a 
39motion to enforce payment of the reimbursement fee.
406.  Motion to enforce payment of reimbursement fee.  The attorney for the State, 
41the attorney for the county or the court may initiate a motion to enforce payment of a 
42reimbursement fee.  Notification for the hearing on the motion must be sent by regular 
Page 21 - 129LR0229(01)-11mail to the individual's last known address.  If the individual does not appear for the 
2hearing after proper notification has been sent, the court may issue a bench warrant.
3A.  Unless the individual shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the default 
4was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or 
5to a failure on the individual's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds 
6required to make payment, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and 
7may commit the individual to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 
8the reimbursement fee is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for 
9unexcused default must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 
10months.  An individual committed for nonpayment of a reimbursement fee is given 
11credit toward the payment of a reimbursement fee for each day of confinement that 
12the individual is in custody, at the rate specified in the court's order, which may not 
13be less than $25 or more than $100 of unpaid reimbursement fee for each day of 
14confinement.  The individual is also given credit for each day that the individual has 
15been detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this section.  An 
16individual is responsible for paying any reimbursement fee remaining after receiving 
17credit for confinement and detention.
18B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the individual 
19additional time for payment or may reduce the amount of each installment.
20C.  The confinement ordered under this subsection must be nonconcurrent with any 
21judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.
22§1752.  Supervision fee as condition of probation
23If a court imposes a sentencing alternative authorized under section 1502 that 
24includes a period of probation, it must attach as a condition of probation that the 
25convicted individual pay, through the Department of Corrections, a supervision fee 
26imposed pursuant to section 1807, subsection 6 for the term of probation.
27§1753.  Electronic monitoring fee and substance testing fee as conditions of 
28probation
29If a court imposes a sentencing alternative authorized under section 1502 that 
30includes a period of probation, upon the request of the Department of Corrections, the 
31court shall attach as a condition of probation an electronic monitoring fee, a substance 
32testing fee or both, as governed by section 1807, subsection 7.
33§1754.  Fee for applying to Department of Corrections to temporarily or 
34periodically leave jurisdiction
35If a court requires as a condition of probation that the convicted individual remain 
36within the jurisdiction of the court, unless permission to leave temporarily is granted in 
37writing by the convicted individual's probation officer, the Department of Corrections 
38may impose on the individual applying for permission to leave either temporarily or 
39periodically an application fee, as governed by section 1807, subsection 8.
Page 22 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1755.  Administrative supervision fee as nonmandatory requirement of 
2administrative release
3If a court imposes a suspended sentence with administrative release pursuant to 
4section 1853 and attaches requirements for the term of the administrative release, the 
5court-imposed requirements of administrative release may include an administrative 
6supervision fee, as governed by section 1854, subsection 2, paragraph A.
7§1756.  Administrative supervision fee as nonmandatory requirement of deferred 
8disposition
9If an individual consents to a deferred disposition pursuant to section 1901 and a 
10court orders sentencing to be deferred and imposes requirements to be in effect during the 
11period of deferment, the court-imposed deferment requirements may include an 
12administrative supervision fee, as governed by sections 1902 and 1903.
13§1757.  Surcharges and assessments outside the code
14In addition to the fees authorized by this subchapter, the court shall impose, as 
15applicable, the following surcharges and assessments.

24and the court orders the person to complete a certified batterers' intervention program as 
25defined in Title 19-A, section 4014, the person may be placed on probation for a period 
26not to exceed 2 years, except that, on motion by the person's probation officer, the person 
27or the court, the term of probation must be terminated by the court when the court 
28determines that the person has:

36described in sections 302 and 506-B and the Class D crimes described in sections 554, 
37555 and 758.
387.  Modification of probation requirements authorized.  During the period of 
39probation specified in the sentence made pursuant to this section, and upon application of 
Page 26 - 129LR0229(01)-11the person on probation or the person's probation officer, or upon the court's own motion, 
2the court may, after a hearing upon notice to the probation officer and the person on 
3probation, modify the requirements imposed by the court or a community reparations 
4board, add further requirements authorized by section 1807 or relieve the person on 
5probation of any requirement imposed by the court or a community reparations board 
6that, in the court's opinion, imposes on the person an unreasonable burden.  If the person 
7on probation cannot meet a requirement imposed by the court or a community reparations 
8board, the person shall bring a motion under this subsection.
98.  Ex parte motion for modification by probation officer in advance of hearing.  
10Notwithstanding subsection 7, the court may grant, ex parte, a motion brought by the 
11probation officer of the person on probation to add further requirements if the court 
12determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to give written or oral notice to the 
13person on probation and the requirements are immediately necessary to protect the safety 
14of an individual or the public.  Any requirements added pursuant to an ex parte motion do 
15not take effect until written notice of the requirements, along with written notice of the 
16scheduled date, time and place when the court will hold a hearing on the added 
17requirements, is given to the person on probation.
189.  Conversion of probation to administrative release.  Once the period of 
19probation has commenced, on motion of the person on probation or the person's probation 
20officer, or on the court's own motion, the court may at any time convert a period of 
21probation for a Class D or Class E crime or a Class C crime under Title 29-A, section 
222557-A to a period of administrative release.  A conversion to administrative release may 
23not be ordered unless notice of the motion is given to the probation officer and the 
24attorney for the State.  The provisions of subchapter 2 apply when probation is converted 
25to administrative release.  Conversion to administrative release in accordance with this 
26subsection relieves the person on probation of any obligations imposed by the probation 
27conditions.
2810.  Early termination of probation and discharge authorized.  Once the period of 
29probation has commenced, on motion of the person on probation or the person's probation

31probation and discharge the person at any time earlier than that provided in the sentence 
32made pursuant to this section, if warranted by the conduct of the person.  A termination 
33and discharge may not be ordered unless notice of the motion is given to the probation 
34officer and the attorney for the State.  Termination and discharge in accordance with this 
35subsection relieves the person on probation of any obligations imposed by the sentence of 
36probation.
3711.  Justice or judge authorized to hear motions regarding probation.  A motion 
38and hearing pursuant to subsection 7, 8, 9 or 10 need not be before the justice or judge 
39who originally imposed probation.  Any justice or judge may initiate and hear a motion, 
40and any justice or judge may hear a motion brought by the person on probation or the 
41person's probation officer.
4212.  Termination of probation to prevent delay of consecutive term of 
43imprisonment.  Any court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, shall 
Page 27 - 129LR0229(01)-11terminate a period of probation that would delay commencement of a consecutive 
2unsuspended term of imprisonment.

6may impose a split sentence by sentencing an individual to a term of imprisonment not to 
7exceed the maximum term authorized for the crime, an initial portion of which is to be 
8served and the remainder of which is to be suspended, and accompany the suspension 
9with a period of probation not to exceed the maximum period authorized for the crime.  
10The period of probation commences on the date the individual is released from the 
11unsuspended portion of the term of imprisonment, unless the court orders it to commence 
12on an earlier date.
13A.  If the period of probation commences upon release of the individual from an 
14unsuspended portion of the term of imprisonment, the court may revoke probation for 
15any criminal conduct committed during that unsuspended portion of the term of 
16imprisonment.
17B.  If execution of the sentence is stayed, the court may revoke probation for criminal 
18conduct committed during the period of stay or for failure to report as ordered.
19C.  The court may revoke probation if, during any unsuspended portion of the term of 
20imprisonment, an individual sentenced as a repeat sexual assault offender, pursuant to 
21section 1804, subsection 4, refuses to actively participate in a sex offender treatment 
22program in accordance with the expectations and judgment of the treatment 
23providers, when requested to do so by the Department of Corrections.
24D.  The court may revoke probation if, during an unsuspended portion of the term of 
25imprisonment:
26(1) The individual has contact with a victim with whom the individual has been 
27ordered not to have contact as a condition of probation;
28(2) In the case of an individual who has been committed to the Department of 
29Corrections, the individual has contact with any victim with whom the individual 
30has been prohibited to have contact by the Department of Corrections; or
31(3) In the case of an individual who has been committed to a county or regional 
32jail, the individual has contact with any victim with whom the individual has 
33been prohibited to have contact by the county or regional jail.
34E.  As to both the suspended and unsuspended portions of the sentence, the place of 
35imprisonment must be as follows.
36(1)  For a Class D or Class E crime, the court must specify a county jail as the 
37place of imprisonment.
38(2)  For a Class A, Class B or Class C crime, the court must:
39(a)  Specify a county jail as the place of imprisonment for any portion of the 
40sentence that is 9 months or less; and
Page 28 - 129LR0229(01)-11(b)  Commit the individual to the Department of Corrections for any portion 
2of the sentence that is more than 9 months.
32.  Applicability to prosecution of crime committed prior to September 23, 1983.  
4In any prosecution for a crime committed prior to September 23, 1983, the court may, 
5with the consent of the defendant, impose a sentence under subsection 1.
6§1806.  Wholly suspended term of imprisonment with probation
7Unless prohibited pursuant to section 1802, subsection 1, paragraphs A to F, the court 
8may sentence an individual to a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum term 
9authorized for the crime, suspend the entire term of imprisonment and accompany the 
10suspension with a period of probation not to exceed the maximum period authorized for 
11the crime, to commence on the date the individual goes into actual execution of the 
12sentence.
13§1807.  Conditions of probation
141.  Purpose of conditions.  If the court imposes a sentencing alternative under 
15section 1502 that includes a period of probation, it shall attach conditions of probation, as 
16authorized by this section, as it considers to be reasonable and appropriate to assist the 
17person to lead a law-abiding life, including, without exception, a condition of probation 
18that the person refrain from criminal conduct.
192.  Specific conditions of probation authorized.  As a condition of probation, the 
20court in its sentence may require the person to:
21A.  Support the person's dependents and to meet the person's family responsibilities;
22B.  Make restitution pursuant to chapter 69 to each victim of the person's crime, or to 
23the county where the offense is prosecuted if the identity of the victim cannot be 
24ascertained or if the victim voluntarily refuses the restitution.  If the court orders as a 
25condition of probation that the person forfeit and pay a specific amount of restitution, 
26that order, as a matter of law, also constitutes the imposition of restitution pursuant to 
27chapter 69 as a sentencing alternative and an additional order regarding restitution is 
28unnecessary;
29C.  Pursue and maintain approved employment or an approved occupation;
30D.  Undergo, as an outpatient, available medical or psychiatric treatment, or to enter 
31and remain, as a voluntary patient, in a specified institution when required for that 
32purpose. Failure to comply with this condition is considered only as a violation of 
33probation and may not, in itself, authorize involuntary treatment or hospitalization.  
34The court may not order and the State may not pay for the person to attend a batterers' 
35intervention program unless the program is certified under Title 19-A, section 4014;
36E.  Pursue a prescribed secular course of study or vocational training;
37F.  Refrain from frequenting specified places or consorting with specified persons;
38G.  Refrain from possessing any firearm or other dangerous weapon;
Page 29 - 129LR0229(01)-11H.  Remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless permission to leave 
2temporarily is granted in writing by the person's probation officer, and to notify the 
3probation officer of any change in the person's address or employment;
4I.  Refrain from drug use and use or excessive use of alcohol;
5J.  Report as directed to the court or the person's probation officer, to answer all 
6reasonable inquiries by the probation officer and to permit the probation officer to 
7visit at reasonable times at the person's home or elsewhere;
8K.  Pay any monetary penalty imposed by the court as part of the sentence;
9L.  Perform specified work for the benefit of the State, a county, a municipality, a 
10school administrative district, other public entity or a charitable institution;
11M.   Participate in an electronic monitoring program, if available; or
12N.  Satisfy any conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the person or the 
13public safety or security.
143.  Opportunity to address court regarding probation conditions; written 
15statement required.  The person must be given an opportunity to address the court on 
16the conditions that are proposed to be attached and, after sentence, must be given a 
17written statement setting forth the particular conditions on which the person is released on 
18probation.
194.  Findings or explanation required in certain cases when completion of 
20batterers' intervention program is not ordered as a condition of probation.  If an 
21individual is convicted of a crime under chapter 9 or 13 or section 758 that the State 
22pleads and proves was committed by the individual against a spouse, domestic partner or 
23sexual partner; a former spouse, domestic partner or sexual partner; a victim with whom 
24the individual is living or lived as a spouse; or a victim who is or was a dating partner of 
25the individual and the court does not order as a condition of probation that the individual 
26complete a batterers' intervention program certified pursuant to Title 19-A, section 4014, 
27the court shall make findings on the record of the court's reasons for not ordering the 
28individual to complete a batterers' intervention program. If a plea agreement submitted to 
29the court in accordance with Rule 11A(b) of the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal 
30Procedure does not contain a provision ordering the individual to complete a batterers' 
31intervention program, the attorney for the State shall indicate, in a writing submitted to 
32the court, the basis for the plea agreement's not including completion of a batterers' 
33intervention program as a condition of probation. For purposes of this subsection, "dating 
34partner" means a victim currently or formerly involved in dating the individual, whether 
35or not the individual and the victim are or were sexual partners. For purposes of this 
36subsection, "domestic partner" means one of 2 unmarried adults who are domiciled 
37together under a long-term arrangement that evidences a commitment to remain 
38responsible indefinitely for each other's welfare.
395.  Condition of probation that includes psychiatric treatment or mental health 
40counseling; notice by court to Department of Health and Human Services.  Before 
41imposing any condition of psychiatric outpatient or inpatient treatment or mental health 
42counseling, the court may request that a report be submitted by an agent of the 
Page 30 - 129LR0229(01)-11Department of Health and Human Services who has been designated pursuant to Title 
234-B, section 1220 for the purpose of assessing the appropriateness of psychiatric 
3treatment or mental health counseling for the individual and the availability of this 
4treatment or counseling.  Whether or not a report is requested, the court shall notify the 
5designated agent of the Department of Health and Human Services when any conditions 
6of probation are imposed that include psychiatric outpatient or inpatient treatment or 
7mental health counseling.  This notification must include the name and last known 
8address of the individual placed on probation, the name and address of the attorney of 
9record for that individual and the conditions of probation.
106.  Supervision fee; determination of amount by court; failure to pay.  The court 
11shall attach as a condition of probation that the person pay, through the Department of 
12Corrections, a supervision fee of between $10 and $50 per month, as determined by the 
13court, for the term of probation.  If the court does not set a supervision fee, the 
14supervision fee is $10 per month.  Notwithstanding the attachment of supervision fee 
15conditions on more than one sentence, a person on probation on concurrent sentences is 
16required to pay only one supervision fee.  In determining whether to set an amount higher 
17than $10 per month, the court shall take into account the financial resources of the person 
18and the nature of the burden its payment imposes.  A person may not be sentenced to 
19imprisonment without probation solely for the reason the person is not able to pay the fee.  
20When a person on probation fails to pay the supervision fee, the court may revoke 
21probation as specified in section 1812, unless the person shows that failure to pay was not 
22attributable to a willful refusal to pay or to a failure on that person's part to make a good 
23faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment.  The court, if it determines that 
24revocation of probation is not warranted, shall issue a judgment for the total amount of 
25the fee and shall issue an order attaching a specified portion of money received by or 
26owed to the person on probation until the total amount of the fee has been paid.  If the 
27person makes this showing, the court may allow additional time for payment within the 
28remaining period of probation or reduce the size of the fee to no less than $10 per month, 
29but may not revoke the requirement to pay the fee unless the remaining period of 
30probation is 30 days or less.
317.  Electronic monitoring and substance testing fees; determination of amount 
32by court; failure to pay; use of fees.  Upon the request of the Department of 
33Corrections, the court shall attach as a condition of probation that the person pay, through 
34the department, an electronic monitoring fee, a substance testing fee or both, as 
35determined by the court, for the term of probation.  In determining the amount of the fees, 
36the court shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the 
37burden the payment imposes.  A person may not be sentenced to imprisonment without 
38probation solely for the reason the person is not able to pay the fees.  When a person on 
39probation fails to pay the fees, the court may revoke probation as specified in section 
401812, unless the person shows that failure to pay was not attributable to a willful refusal 
41to pay or to a failure on that person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds 
42required for the payment.  The court, if it determines that revocation of probation is not 
43warranted, shall issue a judgment for the total amount of the fees and shall issue an order 
44attaching a specified portion of money received by or owed to the person on probation 
45until the total amount of the fees has been paid.  If the person makes this showing, the 
46court may allow additional time for payment within the remaining period of probation or 
Page 31 - 129LR0229(01)-11reduce the size of the fees, but may not revoke the requirement to pay the fees unless the 
2remaining period of probation is 30 days or less.  Fees received from a person on 
3probation must be deposited into the department's adult community corrections account, 
4unless the department has required the person to pay fees directly to a provider of 
5electronic monitoring, substance testing or other services.  Funds from the adult 
6community corrections account do not lapse and must be used to defray costs associated 
7with the purchase and operation of electronic monitoring and substance testing programs.
88.  Condition of probation that includes staying within jurisdiction of court; 
9application fee; use of fees.  Whenever the court requires as a condition of probation that 
10the person remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless permission to leave 
11temporarily is granted in writing by the person's probation officer, the Department of 
12Corrections may impose on a person applying for such permission an application fee of 
13$25.  The department may impose on a person an additional fee of $25 per month if 
14permission is sought and granted to leave the jurisdiction of the court on a periodic basis.  
15Permission to leave may not be denied or withdrawn solely because the person is not able 
16to pay the application fee or the additional fee.  When a person fails to pay a fee imposed 
17under this subsection, the department may refuse to process the application or may 
18withdraw permission to leave if the failure to pay is attributable to the person's willful 
19refusal to pay or to a failure on the person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the 
20funds required for the payment.  Fees received from a person pursuant to this subsection 
21must be deposited into the department's adult community corrections account, which does 
22not lapse, and must be used to defray costs associated with processing the applications, 
23including, but not limited to, the cost of materials, equipment, training for probation 
24officers and administration, and for the department's share of the costs of extraditing 
25persons on probation who are fugitives from justice.
26§1808.  Community reparations boards
271.  Persons required to appear before board.  If the court imposes a sentencing 
28alternative that includes a period of probation, the court shall require as a condition of 
29probation that the person appear before a community reparations board, referred to in this 
30section as "the board," and abide by any requirement imposed by the board if:
31A.  The person has been sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment with 
32probation or a split sentence of imprisonment with probation the initial portion of 
33which must be served in a county jail under section 1805;
34B.  The person has not been convicted of a crime under chapter 11 or a crime of 
35domestic violence;
36C.  The Department of Corrections recommends that appearance before the board be 
37required; and
38D.  The court finds no circumstance that makes appearance inappropriate.
392.  Duties of person required to appear before board.  A person required to appear 
40before a community reparations board shall:
41A.  Cooperate with the preparation of the intake report to be submitted to the board;
Page 32 - 129LR0229(01)-11B.  Appear before the board as directed by the person's probation officer; and
2C.  Cooperate with the board.
33.  Powers of board.  The powers of a community reparations board are limited to 
4requiring the person to:
5A.  Pay restitution in accordance with chapter 69;
6B.  Perform community service;
7C.  Complete a prescribed course of counseling or education;
8D.  Refrain from frequenting specified places or consorting with specified persons;
9E.  Comply with reparative sanctions other than restitution, including, but not limited 
10to, writing an apology to the victim and fulfilling crime-impact education measures; 
11and
12F.  Report to the board regarding compliance with the requirements of this 
13subsection.
144.  Time limit on requirement imposed by board.  A requirement imposed by a 
15community reparations board may not extend longer than 6 months, except the 
16requirement to pay restitution.
175.  Violation.  A person who fails to abide by the requirements of this section 
18commits a violation of probation.
19§1809.  Commencement of probation revocation proceedings by arrest
201.  Authority of probation officer.  If a probation officer has probable cause to 
21believe that a person on probation has violated a condition of that person's probation, that 
22officer may arrest the person or cause the person to be arrested for the alleged violation.  
23If the probation officer cannot, with due diligence, locate the person, the officer shall file 
24a written notice of this fact with the court that placed the person on probation.  Upon the 
25filing of that written notice, the court shall issue a warrant for the arrest of that person.
262.  Probable cause hearing; timing; evidence.  A person arrested pursuant to 
27subsection 1, with or without a warrant, must be given a probable cause hearing as soon 
28as reasonably possible, but not later than on the 5th day after arrest, excluding Saturdays, 
29Sundays and holidays.  A probable cause hearing is not given if, within the 5-day period, 
30the person is released from custody or is afforded an opportunity for a court hearing on 
31the alleged violation.  A probable cause hearing is not required if the person is charged 
32with or convicted of a new offense and is incarcerated as a result of the pending charge or 
33conviction.
34A.  Whenever a person arrested pursuant to subsection 1 is entitled to a probable 
35cause hearing pursuant to this subsection, unless the person waives the right to the 
36hearing, that hearing must be held at the initial appearance and may be held in the 
37court located as near to the place where the violation is alleged to have taken place as 
38is reasonable under the circumstances.  If it is alleged that the person violated 
39probation because of the commission of a new offense, the probable cause hearing is 
Page 33 - 129LR0229(01)-11limited to the issue of identification if probable cause on the new offense has already 
2been found by the District Court or by the Superior Court or the person has been 
3indicted, has waived indictment or has been convicted.
4B.  Evidence presented to establish probable cause may include affidavits and other 
5reliable hearsay evidence as permitted by the court.
6C.  If the court determines that there is not probable cause to believe that the person 
7has violated a condition of probation, the court shall order the person's release.
83.  Failure to hold probable cause hearing within required time period.  If a 
9probable cause hearing is not held as required by subsection 2 within the time period 
10specified in subsection 2, it is grounds for the person's release on personal recognizance 
11pending further proceedings.
12§1810.  Commencement of probation revocation proceedings by summons
131.  Authority of probation officer.  If a probation officer has probable cause to 
14believe that a person on probation has violated a condition of probation, that officer may 
15deliver to that person, or cause to be delivered to that person, a summons ordering that 
16person to appear for a court hearing on the alleged violation.
172.  Contents of summons; probation officer to file motion for revocation.  The 
18summons delivered pursuant to subsection 1 must include the signature of the probation 
19officer; a brief statement of the alleged violation; the time and place of the alleged 
20violation; and the time, place and date the person is to appear in court or a statement that 
21the court will notify the person of the time, place and date to appear.  As soon as practical 
22after service of the summons, the probation officer shall file with the court a motion for 
23revocation of probation that sets forth the facts underlying the alleged violation.
243.  Initial appearance.  A person appearing on a motion to revoke probation 
25pursuant to a summons must be given an initial appearance as provided in section 1811, 
26subsection 4.
274.  Failure to appear.  If the person fails to appear in court after having been served 
28with a summons, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.  After arrest, 
29the person must be given a probable cause hearing as provided in section 1809, 
30subsection 2 and an initial appearance as provided in section 1811, subsection 3.
31§1811.  Initial proceedings on probation violation; filing of motion; initial 
32appearance
331.  Timing of motion for probation revocation.  A motion for probation revocation, 
34which first must be approved by the prosecuting attorney, must be filed within 3 days, 
35excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of the arrest of a person on probation 
36pursuant to section 1809.
372.  Contents of motion.  The motion must set forth the facts underlying the alleged 
38violation and, unless the person is to be given a probable cause hearing at the initial 
39appearance as provided in section 1809, must be accompanied by a copy of the summons 
40delivered to the person.
Page 34 - 129LR0229(01)-113.  Timing of initial appearance on motion receipt; copy of motion to person on 
2probation.  Upon receipt of a motion for revocation of probation with respect to a person 
3arrested pursuant to section 1809 or section 1810, subsection 4 who is not sooner 
4released, the court shall provide the person with an initial appearance on the revocation of 
5probation within 5 days after the arrest, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  A 
6copy of the motion must be furnished to the person prior to or at the initial appearance.
74.  Procedure at initial appearance.  At the initial appearance, the court shall advise 
8the person of the contents of the motion, the right to a hearing on the motion, the right to 
9be represented by counsel at a hearing and the right to appointed counsel.  If the person 
10cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  The court shall ask 
11the person to admit or deny the alleged violation.  If the person refuses to admit or deny, a 
12denial must be entered.  In the case of a denial, the court shall set the motion for hearing 
13and may commit the person, with or without bail, pending hearing.  If the person is 
14committed without bail pending hearing, the date of the hearing must be set no later than 
1545 days from the date of the initial appearance.
165.  Bail determination.  In deciding whether to set bail under this section and in 
17setting the kind and amount of that bail, the court must be guided by the standards of 
18post-conviction bail in Title 15, section 1051, subsection 2-A.  Appeal is governed by 
19Title 15, section 1051, subsections 5 and 6.  Bail set under this section is also governed 
20by the sureties and other forms of bail provisions in Title 15, chapter 105-A, subchapter 4 
21and the enforcement provisions in Title 15, chapter 105-A, subchapter 5, articles 1 and 3, 
22including the appeal provisions in Title 15, section 1099-A, subsection 2.
236.  Effect of failure to meet time limits.  Failure to comply with the time limits set 
24forth in this section is not grounds for dismissal of a motion for probation revocation but 
25may be grounds for the release of the person on probation on personal recognizance 
26pending further proceedings.
27§1812.  Court hearing on probation revocation
281.  Place of hearing.  The hearing on a motion to revoke probation must be held in 
29the court that sentenced the person to probation in either the county or division in which 
30the person resides or is incarcerated, unless the court orders otherwise in the interests of 
31justice.  A motion for revocation of probation need not be heard by the justice or judge 
32who originally imposed probation, but may be heard by any justice or judge.
332.  Hearing procedure.  If a hearing is held, the person on probation must be given 
34the opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses against the person, to present 
35evidence on that person's own behalf and to be represented by counsel.  If the person 
36cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  Assignment of 
37counsel, to the extent not covered in this subsection, and withdrawal of counsel must be 
38in accordance with the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure.
393.  Commission of new crime while on probation.  When the alleged violation 
40constitutes a crime for which the person on probation has not been convicted, the court 
41may revoke probation if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person 
42committed the crime. If the person is subsequently convicted of the crime, or any other 
Page 35 - 129LR0229(01)-11crime or crimes arising out of the same conduct, sentencing is subject to the requirements 
2of section 1608. If concurrent terms of imprisonment are imposed and the terms do not 
3commence on the same date, any time served as a result of the probation revocation must 
4be deducted from the time the person is required to serve as a result of the new 
5conviction.
64.  Failure to comply with requirement of probation.  If the alleged violation does 
7not constitute a crime and the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
8person on probation has inexcusably failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a 
9condition of probation, it may revoke probation.
105.  Conviction for new crime while on probation.  If a person on probation is 
11convicted of a new crime during the period of probation, the court may sentence that 
12person for the crime and revoke probation.  If the person has been sentenced for the new 
13crime and probation revocation proceedings are subsequently commenced, the court that 
14conducts the revocation hearing may revoke probation. Sentencing for the multiple 
15offenses is subject to section 1608. If concurrent terms of imprisonment are imposed and 
16the terms do not commence on the same date, any time served as a result of the new 
17conviction must be deducted from the time the person is required to serve as a result of 
18the probation revocation.
196.  Authority of court finding violation of probation.  Upon a finding of a violation 
20of probation, the court may vacate all, part or none of the suspension of execution as to 
21imprisonment or fine specified when probation was granted, considering the nature of the 
22violation and the reasons for granting probation. The remaining portion of the sentence 
23for which suspension of execution is not vacated upon the revocation of probation 
24remains suspended and is subject to revocation at a later date. During the service of that 
25portion of the sentence imposed for which the suspension of execution was vacated upon 
26revocation, the running of the period of probation must be interrupted and resumes again 
27upon release.  If the court finds a violation of probation but vacates none of the suspended 
28sentence, the running of the period of probation resumes upon entry of that final 
29disposition.  The court may nevertheless revoke probation and vacate the suspension of 
30execution as to the remainder of the suspended sentence or a portion thereof for any 
31criminal conduct committed during the service of that portion of the sentence for which 
32the suspension of execution was vacated upon revocation.
337.  Tolling of period of probation; conditions of probation continue in effect.  The 
34running of the period of probation is tolled upon either the delivery of the summons, the 
35filing of the written notice with the court that the person cannot be located or the arrest of 
36the person.  If the motion is dismissed or withdrawn, or if the court finds no violation of 
37probation, the running of the period of probation is deemed not to have been tolled.  The 
38conditions of probation continue in effect during the tolling of the running of the period 
39of probation, and any violation of a condition subjects the person to a revocation of 
40probation pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.
418.  Disposition agreement by parties in return for admission of probation 
42violation.  If the attorney for the State and the attorney for the person on probation or the 
43person on probation reach agreement that, in return for an admission of a violation of 
44probation, the attorney for the State will dismiss other charges or the attorney for the 
Page 36 - 129LR0229(01)-11State will not oppose the requested disposition requested by the person or the attorney for 
2the State will recommend a particular disposition or both sides will recommend a 
3particular disposition, and the court at the time of disposition intends to enter a 
4disposition less favorable to the person than that recommended, the court shall on the 
5record:
6A.  Inform the parties of this intention;
7B.  Advise the person personally in open court that the court is not bound by the 
8recommendation;
9C.  Advise the person that if the person does not withdraw the admission, the 
10disposition of the motion will be less favorable to the person than that recommended; 
11and
12D.  Give the person the opportunity to withdraw the admission.
13The court shall, if possible, inform the person of the intended disposition.
149.  Deduction of time for detention pending revocation proceeding.  Whenever a 
15person is detained in any correctional facility, mental health institute or county jail 
16pending a probation revocation proceeding, and not in execution of any other sentence of 
17confinement, that period of detention must be deducted from the time the person is 
18required to serve under that portion of the sentence for which the suspension of execution 
19was vacated as a result of the probation revocation.  A person who is simultaneously 
20detained for conduct for which the person receives a consecutive term of imprisonment is 
21not entitled to receive a day-for-day deduction from the consecutive term of 
22imprisonment for the period of simultaneous detention except for any period of detention 
23that is longer than the prior term of imprisonment.
2410.  Respecification of place of imprisonment following vacation of suspension of 
25sentence.  Whenever a previously suspended sentence of imprisonment for a Class A, 
26Class B or Class C crime is vacated, in whole or in part, as the result of a probation 
27revocation, the court must respecify the place of imprisonment for both the portion 
28required to be served and any remaining suspended portion, if necessary, to carry out the 
29intent of section 1805, subsection 1, paragraph D.
3011.  Effect of vacating suspension while person in execution of unsuspended 
31portion of sentence.  If a probation revocation proceeding results in the court vacating a 
32part of the suspension of execution as to imprisonment while the person is in execution of 
33the initial unsuspended portion of the sentence, the portion of imprisonment to be served 
34as a result of the vacating commences only after the initial unsuspended portion of 
35imprisonment has been fully served.  If separate probation revocation proceedings result 
36in the vacating of 2 or more parts of the suspension of execution as to imprisonment on 
37the same sentence, the portions to be served must be served successively.
38§1813.  Review
391.  Discretionary appeal to Law Court.  Review of a revocation of probation 
40pursuant to section 1812 must be by appeal to the Law Court.  A person whose probation 
41is revoked may not appeal as of right.  The time for taking the appeal and the manner and 
Page 37 - 129LR0229(01)-11any conditions for the taking of the appeal are as the Supreme Judicial Court provides by 
2rule.
32.  Assignment and withdrawal of counsel.  Assignment and withdrawal of counsel 
4for an appeal under this section must be in accordance with the Maine Rules of Unified 
5Criminal Procedure.
6§1814.  Additional conditions in lieu of probation revocation proceedings
7Whenever a probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person under the 
8supervision of that probation officer has violated a condition of probation but the 
9violation does not constitute a crime, the probation officer, instead of commencing a 
10probation revocation proceeding under section 1809, may offer to the person the option of 
11adding one or more of the following conditions to the person's probation:
121.  Participation in public restitution program or treatment program.  The 
13person will participate in a public restitution program or treatment program administered 
14through a correctional facility or county jail; or
152.  Residence at correctional facility or county jail.  The person will reside at a 
16correctional facility or county jail for a period of time not to exceed 90 days.
17If the person agrees in writing to the additional conditions under subsection 1 or 2, 
18the conditions must be implemented.  If the person does not agree or if the person fails to 
19fulfill the additional conditions to the satisfaction of the probation officer, the probation 
20officer may commence probation revocation proceedings under section 1809 or 1810 for 
21the violation that the probation officer had probable cause to believe occurred.  If the 
22person fulfills the additional conditions to the satisfaction of the probation officer, the 
23probation officer shall so notify the person in writing and the probation officer may not 
24commence probation revocation proceedings for the violation that the probation officer 
25had probable cause to believe occurred.
26SUBCHAPTER 2
27ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASE
28§1851.  Eligibility for sentencing alternative that includes period of administrative 
29release; exceptions
30The court may sentence a person who has been convicted of a Class D or Class E 
31crime or a Class C crime under Title 29-A, former section 2557, section 2557-A or 
32section 2558 to a sentencing alternative under section 1502, subsection 2, paragraphs I, J 
33and K for an individual and section 1502, subsection 7, paragraph E for an organization, 
34unless:
351.  Sentencing alternative includes probation.   The court sentences the person to a 
36sentencing alternative under section 1502 that includes a period of probation; or
372.  Sentencing alternative diminishes gravity of crime.  The court finds that such a 
38sentence would diminish the gravity of the crime for which that person was convicted.
Page 38 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1852.  Period of administrative release
21.  Time limit.  A period of administrative release imposed pursuant to this 
3subchapter may not exceed one year.
42.  Modification of requirements.  During the period of administrative release and 
5upon application of a person placed on administrative release or of the attorney for the 
6State or upon the court's own motion, the court, after notice to the attorney for the State 
7and the person and a hearing, may modify the requirements imposed by the court, add 
8further requirements or release the person of any requirement imposed by the court that, 
9in the court's opinion, imposes on the person an unreasonable burden.
103.  Inability to meet requirement; duty on person to bring motion.  During the 
11period of administrative release, if the person cannot meet a requirement of 
12administrative release imposed by the court, the person shall bring a motion pursuant to 
13subsection 2.
144.  Termination by court.  On application of the attorney for the State or of the 
15person placed on administrative release or on the court's own motion, the court may 
16terminate a period of administrative release and discharge the person at any time earlier 
17than that provided in the sentence made pursuant to subsection 1 if warranted by the 
18conduct of the person.  The court may not order a termination of the period of 
19administrative release and discharge upon the motion of the person placed on 
20administrative release unless notice of the motion is given to the attorney for the State by 
21the person placed on administrative release.  The termination of the period of 
22administrative release and discharge relieves the person placed on administrative release 
23of any obligations imposed by the sentence of administrative release.
245.  Termination to prevent delay of consecutive term of imprisonment.  The 
25court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, shall terminate a period of 
26administrative release that would delay commencement of a consecutive unsuspended 
27term of imprisonment.
28§1853.  Suspended sentence with administrative release
291.  Suspension of term of imprisonment accompanied by administrative release.  
30The court may sentence a person to a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum 
31term authorized for a Class D or Class E crime or the Class C crime under Title 29-A, 
32former section 2557, section 2557-A or section 2558, suspend the term of imprisonment 
33in whole or in part and accompany the suspension with a period of administrative release.
342.  Suspension of fine accompanied by administrative release.  The court may 
35sentence a person to a fine, not to exceed the maximum fine authorized for a Class D or 
36Class E crime or the Class C crime under Title 29-A, former section 2557, section 
372557-A or section 2558, suspend the fine in whole or in part and accompany the 
38suspension with a period of administrative release.
Page 39 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1854.  Requirements of administrative release
2If the court imposes a suspended sentence with administrative release under section 
31853, the court shall attach requirements of administrative release, as authorized by this 
4section, as the court determines to be reasonable and appropriate to help ensure 
5accountability and rehabilitation of the person.
61.  Mandatory requirements.  The court-imposed requirements of administrative 
7release must include a requirement that the person refrain from criminal conduct and that 
8the person pay all assessments, surcharges, other fees and costs required by law.

12than $50 per month, as determined by the court, for the term of the administrative 
13release.  In determining the amount of the fee, the court shall take into account the 
14financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden its payment imposes.  
15When a person fails to pay the administrative supervision fee, the court may revoke 
16administrative release as provided in sections 1855 and 1856 unless the person shows 
17that failure to pay was not attributable to a willful refusal to pay or to a failure on that 
18person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment;
19B.  To pay a fine imposed by the court as part of the sentence;
20C.  To make restitution to each victim of the crime imposed by the court as part of the 
21sentence;
22D.  To perform community service work imposed by the court as part of the sentence;

84; if the person is retained in custody, section 1811, subsection 3 also applies.
95.  Arrest of person for violation of requirement of administrative release; copy

14request that a warrantless arrest be made of the person pursuant to section 15, subsection 
151, paragraph A, subparagraph (15).  The court shall provide the person with an initial 
16appearance on the revocation of administrative release within 5 days after arrest unless 
17the person is released before that.  A copy of the motion must be furnished to the person 
18prior to or at the initial appearance.  The initial appearance is governed by section 1811,

27SUPERVISED RELEASE FOR SEX OFFENDERS
28§1881.  Inclusion of period of supervised release after imprisonment
291.  Mandatory imposition of supervised release.  If a person is convicted of gross 
30sexual assault with a person who has not yet attained 12 years of age, in violation of 
31section 253, subsection 1, paragraph C, the court, in addition to imposing as part of the 
32sentence a definite term of imprisonment in accordance with section 253-A, subsection 2, 
33shall impose as part of the sentence a period of supervised release of up to life to 
34immediately follow that imprisonment.  The period of supervised release commences on 
35the date the person is released from confinement pursuant to section 2314 and must 
36include the best available monitoring technology for the full period of supervised release.
372.  Discretionary imposition of supervised release.  If a person is convicted of 
38gross sexual assault in violation of any provision of section 253 other than section 253, 
39subsection 1, paragraph C, the court, if it imposes as part of the sentence a definite term 
Page 41 - 129LR0229(01)-11of imprisonment that does not include a period of probation, also may impose as part of 
2the sentence a period of supervised release to immediately follow that imprisonment.  The 
3period of supervised release commences on the date the person is released from 
4confinement pursuant to section 2314.
5If a person has been convicted of violating any provision of section 253 other than section 
6253, subsection 1, paragraph C, the authorized period of supervised release is:
7A.  Any period of years for a person sentenced as a repeat sexual assault offender 
8pursuant to section 253-A, subsection 1; and
9B.  For a person not sentenced under section 253-A, subsection 1 or 2, a period not to 
10exceed 10 years for a Class A violation of section 253 and a period not to exceed 6 
11years for a Class B or Class C violation of section 253.
123.  Modification of requirements.  During the period of supervised release specified 
13in the sentence made pursuant to subsections 1 and 2, and upon application of a person on 
14supervised release or the person's probation officer, or upon the court's own motion, the 
15court, after notice to the probation officer and the person on supervised release and a 
16hearing, may modify the requirements imposed by the court, add further requirements 
17authorized by section 1882 or relieve the person on supervised release of any requirement 
18imposed by the court that, in its opinion, imposes on the person an unreasonable burden.
194.  Ex parte modification of requirements for immediate necessity.  
20Notwithstanding subsection 3, the court may grant, ex parte, a motion brought by the 
21probation officer of the person on supervised release to add further requirements if the 
22court determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to give written or oral notice 
23to the person on supervised release and the requirements are immediately necessary to 
24protect the safety of an individual or the public.  Any requirements added pursuant to an 
25ex parte motion do not take effect until written notice of the requirements, along with 
26written notice of the scheduled date, time and place when the court will hold a hearing on 
27the added requirements, is given to the person on supervised release.
285.  Termination by court.  On application of the person on supervised release or the 
29person's probation officer, or on the court's own motion, and if warranted by the conduct 
30of the person, the court may terminate a period of supervised release and discharge the 
31person at any time earlier than that provided in the sentence made pursuant to subsections 
321 and 2.  A termination and discharge may not be ordered unless notice of the motion is 
33given to the probation officer and the attorney for the State.  A termination and discharge 
34relieves the person on supervised release of any obligations imposed by the sentence of 
35supervised release.
366.  Termination to prevent delay of consecutive term of imprisonment.  The 
37court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, shall terminate a period of 
38supervised release that would delay commencement of a consecutive unsuspended term 
39of imprisonment.
407.  Revoked period of supervised release to be served in prison.  The court may 
41revoke a period of supervised release pursuant to section 1883 for any ground specified in 
42subsection 8.  If the court revokes a period of supervised release, the court shall require 
Page 42 - 129LR0229(01)-11the person to serve time in prison under the custody of the Department of Corrections.  
2This time in prison may equal all or part of the period of supervised release, without 
3credit for time served on post-release supervision.  The remaining portion of the period of 
4supervised release that is not required to be served in prison, if any, may not run during 
5the time in prison and must resume again after the person's release and is subject to 
6revocation at a later date.
78.  Grounds for revocation.  The court may revoke a period of supervised release 
8for:
9A.  A violation of supervised release;
10B.  Criminal conduct committed during the term of imprisonment; or
11C.  Refusal during the term of imprisonment to actively participate, when requested 
12to do so by the Department of Corrections, in a sex offender treatment program in 
13accordance with the expectations and judgment of the treatment providers.
14§1882.  Conditions of supervised release
15If the court imposes a sentence that includes a period of supervised release, it shall set 
16conditions of supervised release.  The conditions of release that apply to probation under 
17section 1807 apply to conditions of supervised release.  The court may also set conditions 
18of supervised release that it determines to be reasonable and appropriate to manage the 
19person's behavior.
20§1883.  Revocation procedures
21The procedures, rights and responsibilities that apply to probation revocation under 
22sections 1809 to 1812, including bail under section 1811, subsections 5 and 6 and 
23appellate review of revocation under section 1813, apply to revocation of supervised 
24release.

26DEFERRED DISPOSITION
27§1901.  Eligibility for deferred disposition
28A person who has pleaded guilty to a Class C, Class D or Class E crime and who 
29consents to a deferred disposition in writing is eligible for a deferred disposition.
30§1902.  Deferred disposition
311.  Authority of court to order deferment and impose requirements; 
32administrative supervision fee.  Following the acceptance of a plea of guilty for a crime 
33for which a person is eligible for a deferred disposition under section 1901, the court may 
34order sentencing deferred to a date certain or determinable and impose requirements upon 
35the person, to be in effect during the period of deferment, considered by the court to be 
36reasonable and appropriate to assist the person to lead a law-abiding life.  The court-
37imposed deferment requirements must include a requirement that the person refrain from 
Page 43 - 129LR0229(01)-11criminal conduct and may include a requirement that the person pay to the appropriate 
2county an administrative supervision fee of not more than $50 per month, as determined 
3by the court, for the term of the deferment.  In determining the amount of the fee, the 
4court shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the 
5burden its payment imposes.  In exchange for the deferred sentencing, the person shall 
6abide by the court-imposed deferment requirements.  Unless the court orders otherwise, 
7the requirements are immediately in effect.
82.  Modification of requirements.  During the period of deferment and upon 
9application of the person granted deferred disposition pursuant to subsection 1 or of the 
10attorney for the State or upon the court's own motion, the court may, after a hearing upon 
11notice to the attorney for the State and the person, modify the requirements imposed by 
12the court, add further requirements or relieve the person of any requirement imposed by 
13the court that, in the court's opinion, imposes an unreasonable burden on the person.
143.  Inability to meet requirement; duty on person to bring motion.  During the 
15period of deferment, if the person cannot meet a deferment requirement imposed by the 
16court, the person shall bring a motion pursuant to subsection 2.
174.  Determination of date of conviction; bail.  For purposes of a deferred 
18disposition, a person is deemed to have been convicted when the court imposes the 
19sentence.  Notwithstanding Title 15, chapter 105-A, subchapter 3, prior to sentence 
20imposition, preconviction bail applies to the person.
215.  Preferred disposition in prosecution for possession of schedule W drug.  A 
22deferred disposition is a preferred disposition in a prosecution for possession of schedule 
23W drugs under section 1107-A, subsection 1, paragraphs B and B-1.
24§1903.  Court hearing as to final disposition
251.  Final disposition following period of deferment.  Unless a court hearing is 
26sooner held under subsection 3, and except as provided in subsection 2, at the conclusion 
27of the period of deferment, after notice, a person who was granted deferred disposition 
28pursuant to section 1902 shall return to court for a hearing on final disposition.  If the 
29person demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has complied 
30with the court-imposed deferment requirements, the court shall impose a sentencing 
31alternative authorized for the crime to which the person pled guilty and consented to in 
32writing at the time sentencing was deferred or as amended by agreement of the parties in 
33writing prior to sentencing, unless the attorney for the State, prior to sentence imposition, 
34moves the court to allow the person to withdraw the plea of guilty.  Except over the 
35objection of the person, the court shall grant the State's motion.  If the court grants the 
36State's motion, the attorney for the State shall dismiss the pending charging instrument 
37with prejudice.  If the court finds that the person has inexcusably failed to comply with 
38the court-imposed deferment requirements, the court shall impose a sentencing alternative 
39authorized for the crime to which the person pled guilty.
402.  Consensual withdrawal of guilty plea by parties.  Notwithstanding subsection 
411, if at the conclusion of the period of deferment and prior to sentence imposition the 
42attorney for the State in writing moves the court to allow the person to withdraw the plea 
Page 44 - 129LR0229(01)-11of guilty and the person in writing agrees to such withdrawal, the court may, without a 
2hearing on final disposition and in the absence of the person, grant the attorney for the 
3State's motion and allow the person to withdraw the plea.  Following such court action, 
4the attorney for the State shall dismiss the pending charging instrument with prejudice.
53.  Violation of deferment requirement.  If during the period of deferment the 
6attorney for the State has probable cause to believe that a person who was granted 
7deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 has violated a court-imposed deferment 
8requirement, the attorney for the State may move the court to terminate the remainder of 
9the period of deferment and impose sentence.  Following notice and hearing, if the 
10attorney for the State proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has 
11inexcusably failed to comply with a court-imposed deferment requirement, the court may 
12continue the running of the period of deferment with the requirements unchanged, modify 
13the requirements, add further requirements or terminate the running of the period of 
14deferment and impose a sentencing alternative authorized for the crime to which the 
15person pled guilty.  When a person fails to pay an administrative supervision fee imposed 
16under section 1902, subsection 1, the court may terminate the running of the period of 
17deferment and impose sentence unless the person shows that failure to pay was not 
18attributable to a willful refusal to pay or to a failure on that person's part to make a good 
19faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment.  If the court finds that the person 
20has not inexcusably failed to comply with a court-imposed deferment requirement, the 
21court may order that the running of the period of deferment continue or, after notice and 
22hearing, take any other action permitted under this subchapter.
234.  Place of hearing.  A hearing under this section or section 1902 must be held in 
24the court that ordered the deferred disposition.  The hearing need not be conducted by the 
25justice or judge who originally ordered the deferred disposition.
265.  Rights of person at hearing.  The person at a hearing under this section or 
27section 1902 must be given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses 
28against the person, to present evidence on that person's own behalf and to be represented 
29by counsel.  If the person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 
30cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  Assignment of 
31counsel and withdrawal of counsel must be in accordance with the Maine Rules of 
32Unified Criminal Procedure.
336.  Summons to appear at hearing; failure to appear.  A summons may be used to 
34order a person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 to appear 
35for a hearing under this section.  If the person fails to appear after having been served 
36with a summons, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.
377.  Authority of attorney for State regarding violation of condition of deferment.  
38If during the period of deferment the attorney for the State has probable cause to believe 
39that a person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 has violated 
40a court-imposed deferment requirement, the attorney for the State may apply for a 
41warrant for the arrest of the person or request that a warrantless arrest be made of the 
42person pursuant to section 15, subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraph (17).
Page 45 - 129LR0229(01)-11§1904.  Limited review by appeal
2A person may not attack the legality of a deferred disposition, including a final 
3disposition, except that a person who has been determined by a court to have inexcusably 
4failed to comply with a court-imposed deferment requirement and thereafter has been 
5sentenced to an alternative authorized for the crime may appeal to the Law Court, but not 
6as of right.  The time for taking the appeal and the manner and any conditions for the 
7taking of the appeal are as the Supreme Judicial Court provides by rule.
8CHAPTER 69
9RESTITUTION
10§2001.  Purpose
11The Legislature finds and declares that the victims of crimes often suffer losses 
12through no fault of their own and for which there is no compensation. It also finds that 
13repayment, in whole or in part, by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime can 
14operate to rehabilitate the offender in certain instances. It is the purpose of this chapter to 
15encourage the compensation of victims by the person most responsible for the loss 
16incurred by the victim, the offender. Restitution by the offender can serve to reinforce the 
17offender's sense of responsibility for the offense, to provide the offender the opportunity 
18to pay the offender's debt to society and to the offender's victim in a constructive manner 
19and to ease the burden of the victim as a result of the criminal conduct.
20The Legislature recognizes that a crime is an offense against society as a whole, not 
21only against the victim of the crime, and that restitution for victims is therefore ancillary 
22to the central objectives of the criminal law. It intends restitution to be applied only when 
23other purposes of sentencing can be appropriately served.
24The Legislature does not intend the use of restitution to result in preferential 
25treatment for offenders with substantial financial resources.

28have the following meanings.
291.  Collateral source.  "Collateral source" means a source of benefits or advantages

14critical investigation expenses.
15A.  "Allowable expense" means reasonable charges incurred for reasonably needed

23providing nursing care and related services, in excess of a reasonable and customary 
24charge for semiprivate accommodations, unless other accommodations are medically 
25required.
26B.  "Critical investigation expense" means a necessary expense incurred by a 
27government or by a victim while investigating or prosecuting suspected criminal

30extent a victim has suffered financial harm from criminal conduct by an employee or 
31other person in a position of trust and the cost of analysis of suspected illegal drugs.
32C.  "Dependent's economic loss" means loss after a decedent's death of contributions 
33of things of economic value to the decedent's dependents, not including services they

35injury, less expenses of the dependents avoided by reason of decedent's death.
36D.  "Dependent's replacement loss" means loss reasonably incurred by dependents 
37after a decedent's death in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those

5agency in reasonably making an appropriate emergency response to the incident, 
6including a response to a suspected unlawful methamphetamine laboratory under 
7section 1124, but only includes those costs directly arising because of the response to 
8the particular incident.  Reasonable costs include the costs of providing police, 
9firefighting, rescue and emergency medical services at the scene of the incident, as 
10well as the compensation for the personnel, including trained laboratory personnel, 
11responding to the incident.  "Public agency" means the State or any county, 
12municipality, district or public authority located, in whole or in part, within this State 
13that provides or may provide laboratory services or police, firefighting, ambulance or 
14other emergency services.
15G.  "Property loss" means the value of property taken from the victim, or of property 
16destroyed or otherwise broken or harmed.  A property loss includes the value of taxes

21not, in fact, recovered by the State at the time of sentencing, regardless of whether 
22other money or items of value are sought, acquired or forfeited pursuant to Title 15, 
23chapter 517.  In cases involving a violation of chapter 45, the court must make a 
24finding that the property loss is specifically related to that case.
25H.  "Replacement services loss" means expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining 
26ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those the injured person would have 
27performed, not for income but for the benefit of the injured person or the injured 
28person's family, if the injured person had not been injured.
29I.  "Work loss" means loss of income from work the injured person would have

33actually performed by the injured person or by income the injured person would have 
34earned in available appropriate substitute work the injured person was capable of 
35performing but unreasonably failed to undertake.  For a victim of a human trafficking 
36offense as defined in Title 5, section 4701, subsection 1, paragraph C, "work loss" 
37includes pay or benefits unfairly or illegally withheld from the victim by the offender 
38or any unfair labor agreement under Title 26, section 629, as defined by rules adopted

19restitution.
203.  Restitution required.  In any prosecution for a crime committed prior to the

30government entity that has provided recovery to the victim as a collateral source, but only 
31to the extent that such recovery was actually made; and
324.  Person acting on behalf of victim.  Any person legally authorized to act on 
33behalf of the victim.
Page 49 - 129LR0229(01)-11§2005.  Criteria for restitution
21.  Restitution authorized.  Restitution may be authorized, in whole or in part, as 
3compensation for economic loss. In determining the amount of restitution authorized, the 
4following must be considered:
5A.  The contributory misconduct of the victim;
6B.  Failure to report the crime to a law enforcement officer within 72 hours after its 
7occurrence, without good cause for failure to report within that time; and
8C.  The present and future financial capacity of the offender to pay restitution.
92.  Restitution not authorized.  Restitution is not authorized: 
10A.  To a victim without that victim's consent;
11B.  To a victim who is an accomplice of the offender;
12C.  To a victim who has otherwise been compensated from a collateral source, but 
13economic loss in excess of the collateral compensation may be authorized; and
14D.  When the amount and method of payment of monetary restitution or the 
15performance of service restitution creates an excessive financial hardship on the 
16offender or dependent of the offender. In making this determination, all relevant 
17factors must be considered, including, but not limited to, the following:
18(1)  The number of the offender's dependents;
19(2)  The minimum living expenses of the offender and the offender's dependents;
20(3)  The special needs of the offender and the offender's dependents, including 
21necessary travel expense to and from work;
22(4)  The offender's present income and potential future earning capacity; and
23(5)  The offender's resources, from whatever source.
243.  Exception.  The provisions of subsection 2, paragraph D do not apply to an 
25offender that is an organization.
264.  Burdens of proof.  An offender who asserts a present or future incapacity to pay 
27restitution has the burden of proving the incapacity by a preponderance of the evidence.  
28On appeal of a restitution order, the offender has the burden of demonstrating that the 
29incapacity was proven as a matter of law.
30§2006.  Time and method of restitution
31When restitution is authorized, and the offender is not committed to the Department 
32of Corrections and does not receive a sentence that includes a period of probation, the 
33time and method of payment or of the performance of the services must be specified by 
34the court and monetary compensation may be ordered paid to the office of the prosecuting 
35attorney who is prosecuting the case or to the clerk of the court.  If the offender is 
36committed to the Department of Corrections or receives a sentence that includes a period 
37of probation, monetary compensation must be paid to the Department of Corrections and 
Page 50 - 129LR0229(01)-11the time and method of payment must be determined by the Department of Corrections 
2during the term of commitment or the period of probation unless at the time of sentencing 
3the court has specified the time and method of payment.  Once any term of commitment 
4to the Department of Corrections or period of probation is completed and if the restitution 
5ordered has not been paid in full, the offender is subject to the provisions of section 2011 
6and, in the event of a default, the provisions of section 2015.  The state agency receiving 
7the restitution shall deposit any money received in the account maintained by the 
8Treasurer of State for deposit of state agency funds, from which funds are daily 
9transferred to an investment account and invested.  Interest accrued on that money is the 
10property of and accrues to the State for deposit in the General Fund.  The agency 
11receiving the restitution shall make the disbursement to the victim or other authorized 
12claimant as soon as possible after the agency receives the money.
13§2007.  Income withholding order
141.  Instructions for employer.  When restitution is required of an offender who will 
15not be commencing service of a period of institutional confinement, who does not receive 
16a sentence that includes a period of probation and who is employed, the court shall, at the 
17time of ordering restitution, enter a separate order for income withholding.  When 
18restitution is required of an offender who receives a sentence that includes a period of 
19probation and who is employed, upon application of the offender's probation officer, the 
20court shall enter a separate order for income withholding.  The withholding order must 
21direct the employer to deduct from all income due and payable to the offender an amount 
22determined pursuant to section 2006 to meet the offender's restitution obligation.  The 
23withholding order must include an instruction to the employer that upon receipt of a copy 
24of the withholding order the employer shall:
25A.  Immediately begin to withhold the offender's income when the offender is usually 
26paid;
27B.  Send each amount withheld to the agency to which restitution has been ordered to 
28be paid at the address set forth in the order within 7 business days of the withholding; 
29and
30C.  Identify each amount sent to the agency by indicating the court's docket number.
312.  Term of order.  The income withholding order is effective as long as the order for 
32restitution upon which it is based is effective, including after a defendant is no longer in 
33the custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and has not paid 
34the restitution in full as described in section 2011, or until further order of the court.
35§2008.  Deceased victims
36An offender's obligation to pay restitution is not affected by the death of the victim to 
37whom the restitution is due.  The money collected as restitution must be forwarded to the 
38estate of the victim.
Page 51 - 129LR0229(01)-11§2009.  Victim unable to be located
2If the location of a victim cannot, with due diligence, be ascertained, the money 
3collected as restitution must be forwarded to the Treasurer of State to be handled as 
4unclaimed property.
5§2010.  Joint and several order
6If the victim's financial loss has been caused by more than one offender, the order 
7must designate that the restitution is to be paid on a joint and several basis, unless the 
8court specifically determines that one defendant should not equally share the burden.  The 
9agency collecting restitution pursuant to a joint and several order may, after the full 
10amount of restitution has been collected and disbursed to the victim, continue to collect 
11payments from an offender who has not paid an equal share of the restitution and may 
12disburse the money collected to any other offender who has paid more than an equal 
13share of the restitution.
14§2011.  Former Department of Corrections' clients owing restitution
15An offender is responsible for paying any restitution outstanding at the time the term 
16of commitment to the Department of Corrections or period of probation is completed.  An 
17offender who has complied with the time and method of payment of monetary 
18compensation determined by the Department of Corrections during the period of 
19probation shall continue to make payments to the Department of Corrections in 
20accordance with that payment schedule unless modified by the court pursuant to section 
212014 or 2015.  An offender who has not complied with the time and method of payment 
22of monetary compensation determined by the Department of Corrections during the 
23period of probation must be returned to the court for further disposition pursuant to 
24section 2015.  An offender who is unconditionally released and discharged from 
25institutional confinement with the Department of Corrections upon the expiration of the 
26sentence must, upon application of the office of the attorney for the State, be returned to 
27the court for specification by the court of the time and method of payment of monetary 
28compensation, which may be ordered paid to the office of the attorney for the State who 
29prosecuted the case or to the clerk of the court.  Prior to the offender's release and 
30discharge, the Department of Corrections shall provide the office of the attorney for the 
31State who prosecuted the case written notice as to the amount of restitution outstanding.  
32An income withholding order issued pursuant to section 2007 remains effective and 
33enforceable until the restitution is paid in full, even after an offender is no longer in the 
34custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections.
35§2012.  Restitution deducted from judgment in civil action
36Any restitution ordered and paid must be deducted from the amount of any judgment 
37awarded in a civil action brought by the victim against the offender based on the same 
38facts. If the restitution ordered and made was work restitution, the reasonable value of the 
39services may be deducted from any such judgment.
Page 52 - 129LR0229(01)-11§2013.  Post-conviction relief
2If, in any judicial proceeding following conviction, a court issues a final judgment 
3invalidating the conviction, the judgment may include an order that any or all of a 
4restitution payment that the convicted person paid pursuant to the sentence for that 
5conviction be returned to the convicted person.
6§2014.  Modification of restitution
7A convicted person who cannot make restitution payments in the manner ordered by 
8the court or determined by the Department of Corrections pursuant to section 2006 shall 
9move the court for a modification of the time or method of payment or service to avoid a 
10default.  The court may modify its prior order or the determination of the Department of 
11Corrections to reduce the amount of each installment or to allow additional time for 
12payment or service.
13§2015.  Default
141.  Return to court. An offender who has been sentenced to make restitution and has 
15defaulted in payment or service thereof must be returned to court to explain the failure to 
16pay or perform the service.
172.  Reports.  A probation officer having knowledge of a default in restitution by an 
18offender shall report the default to the office of the attorney for the State.  An attorney for 
19the State having knowledge of a default in restitution by an offender shall report the 
20default to the court.  If the restitution was a condition of probation, the attorney for the 
21State may file a motion to enforce payment of restitution or, with the written consent of 
22the probation officer, a motion to revoke probation under section 1811.  If the restitution 
23was not a condition of probation, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce 
24payment of restitution.
253.  Motion to enforce payment of restitution.  Either the attorney for the State or 
26the court may initiate a motion to enforce payment of restitution.  Notification for the 
27hearing on the motion must be sent by regular mail to the offender's last known address.  
28If the offender does not appear for the hearing after proper notification has been sent, the 
29court may issue a bench warrant.
30A.  Unless the offender shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the default 
31was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or 
32to a failure on the offender's part to make a good-faith effort to obtain the funds 
33required to make payment, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and 
34may commit the offender to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 
35the restitution is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcused 
36default must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed one day for every 
37$5 of unpaid restitution or 6 months, whichever is shorter. An offender committed for 
38nonpayment of restitution is given credit toward the payment of restitution for each 
39day of confinement that the offender is in custody, at the rate specified in the court's 
40order.  The offender is also given credit for each day that the offender has been 
41detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this section.  An offender 
Page 53 - 129LR0229(01)-11is responsible for paying any restitution remaining after receiving credit for 
2confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining restitution is also governed 
3by this section.
4B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the offender 
5additional time for payment or may reduce the amount of each installment.
6C.  The confinement ordered under this subsection must be nonconcurrent with any 
7judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.
84.  Forfeiture of bail.  When an offender who has been sentenced to make restitution 
9and has defaulted in payment or service of the restitution is declared in forfeiture of bail 
10in the proceeding brought under this section pursuant to Title 15, section 1094, the 
11obligation and sureties of the defendant must be enforced pursuant to Title 15, section 
121094 and the district attorney shall use the proceeds to satisfy the offender's restitution 
13obligation.  Any proceeds from the forfeited bail remaining after the offender's restitution 
14obligation has been satisfied must be used in accordance with Title 15, section 224-A, 
15subsection 2.
165.  Collection.  Upon any default, execution may be levied and other measures 
17authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments may be taken to collect the unpaid 
18restitution.  A levy of execution does not discharge an offender confined to a county jail 
19under subsection 3 for unexcused default until the full amount of the restitution has been 
20collected.
216.  Organizations.  When restitution is imposed on an organization, the person or 
22persons authorized to make disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay 
23the restitution from the organization's assets.  Failure to do so may subject the person or 
24persons to court action pursuant to this section.
257.  Payments.  Payments made pursuant to this section must be made to the same 
26agency to which the restitution was required to be paid under section 2006 or section 
272011, except that if the offender is no longer in the custody or under the supervision of 
28the Department of Corrections the payments must be made to the office of the attorney 
29for the State who prosecuted the case or the clerk of the court, as ordered by the court.
30§2016.  Work program release; restitution
311.  Work program; payment of restitution and fines.  A prisoner who has been 
32ordered to pay restitution or fines may not be released pursuant to a work program 
33administered by the Department of Corrections under Title 34-A, section 3035, or a 
34sheriff under Title 30-A, section 1605, or participate in an industry program under Title 
3534-A, section 1403, subsection 9 or any other program administered by the Department of 
36Corrections or a sheriff by which a prisoner is able to generate money, unless the prisoner 
37consents to pay at least 25% of the prisoner's gross weekly wages or other money 
38generated to the victim or the court until such time as full restitution has been made or the 
39fine is paid in full.  The chief administrative officer of the correctional facility where the 
40prisoner is incarcerated shall collect and disburse to the victim or victims that portion of 
41the prisoner's wages or other money generated agreed to as payment of restitution.  The 
42chief administrative officer of the correctional facility where the prisoner is incarcerated 
Page 54 - 129LR0229(01)-11shall also collect and disburse to the court that portion of the prisoner's wages or other 
2money generated agreed to as payment of fines after the restitution is paid in full.  If the 
3victim or victims ordered by the court to receive restitution cannot be located, the 
4correctional facility shall inform the court that ordered restitution. The court shall 
5determine the distribution of these funds.
62.  Payment of restitution or fines from other sources.  A prisoner, other than one 
7addressed by subsection 1, who receives money, from any source, shall pay 25% of that 
8money to any victim or the court if the court has ordered that restitution or a fine be paid.  
9The chief administrative officer of the correctional facility in which the prisoner is 
10incarcerated shall collect and disburse to the victim or victims that portion of the 
11prisoner's money ordered as restitution.  The chief administrative officer of the 
12correctional facility where the prisoner is incarcerated shall also collect and disburse to 
13the court that portion of the prisoner's money ordered as fines after the restitution is paid 
14in full.  If the victim or victims ordered by the court to receive restitution cannot be 
15located, the correctional facility shall inform the court that ordered restitution. The court 
16shall determine the distribution of these funds.  Money received by the prisoner and 
17directly deposited into a telephone call account established by the Department of 
18Corrections for the sole purpose of paying for use of the department's client telephone 
19system is not subject to this subsection, except that 25% of any money received by the 
20prisoner and transferred from the telephone call account to the department's general client 
21account at the time of the prisoner's discharge or transfer to supervised community 
22confinement must be collected and disbursed as provided in this subsection.
233.  Restitution; absolute.  The requirements imposed on a prisoner by this section to 
24pay restitution and fines during incarceration apply regardless of whether:
25A.  The court order to pay restitution or fines constitutes a sentence or is imposed as a 
26condition of probation;
27B.  Payment has been stayed in the court order;
28C.  The court has specified a time and method of payment pursuant to section 1708, 
29subsection 1 or section 2006; or
30D.  The person's incarceration resulted from a revocation of probation.
31§2017.  Waiver of issue of excessiveness
32If a defendant at the time of sentencing has consented to the imposition by the 
33sentencing court of a specific amount of restitution, the defendant is thereafter precluded 
34from seeking to attack the legality or propriety of the amount of restitution ordered if that 
35amount does not exceed the specific amount consented to by the defendant.
36§2018.  Restitution for benefit of victim
37When compensation is awarded from the Victims' Compensation Fund pursuant to 
38Title 5, chapter 316-A, the amount of any restitution ordered to be paid to or for the 
39benefit of the victim and collected as part of a sentence imposed must be paid by the 
40agency collecting the restitution in an amount not to exceed the amount of the payments 
Page 55 - 129LR0229(01)-11from the fund, directly to the fund if, when added to the payments from the fund, the 
2restitution exceeds the victim's actual loss.
3§2019.  Civil remedy upon default
4Upon the request of the attorney for the State or a person entitled to restitution under 
5an order of restitution, the clerk shall enter the order of restitution in the same manner as 
6a judgment in a civil action.  When entered under this section, the order of restitution is 
7deemed to be a money judgment.  Upon default, the order to make restitution is 
8enforceable in accordance with Title 14, chapter 502 by any person entitled to restitution 
9under the order.

5evidence that the default was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey 
6the court’s order or to a failure on the individual's part to make a good faith effort to 
7comply with the order, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and may:

30Sec. B-14.  17-A MRSA §253-A is enacted to read:
31§253-A.  Special sentencing provisions for gross sexual assault
321.  Any term of years; nonmandatory sentence alternative.  If the State pleads and 
33proves that the defendant is a repeat sexual assault offender, the court may impose a 
34definite term of imprisonment for any term of years.  The court also may impose as part 
35of the sentence either a period of probation of any term of years pursuant to section 1804, 
36subsection 4 or a period of supervised release of any term of years pursuant to section 
371881, subsection 2, paragraph A.
Page 79 - 129LR0229(01)-11As used in this subsection, "repeat sexual assault offender" means a person who commits 
2a new gross sexual assault after having been convicted previously and sentenced for any 
3of the following:
4A.  Gross sexual assault, formerly denominated as gross sexual misconduct;
5B.  Rape;
6C.  Attempted murder accompanied by sexual assault;
7D.  Murder accompanied by sexual assault; or
8E.  Conduct substantially similar to a crime listed in paragraphs A to D that is a crime 
9under the laws of another jurisdiction.
10For purposes of determining whether a defendant is a repeat sexual assault offender, the 
11date of sentencing is the date of the oral pronouncement of the sentence by the trial court, 
12even if an appeal is taken.
13"Accompanied by sexual assault" as used with respect to attempted murder, murder and 
14crimes involving substantially similar conduct in another jurisdiction is satisfied if it was 
15definitionally an element of the crime or was pleaded and proved.
162.  Any term of years; mandatory sentence alternative.  If the State pleads and 
17proves that a crime under section 253 was committed against an individual who had not 
18yet attained 12 years of age, the court shall impose a definite term of imprisonment for 
19any term of years.  In determining the basic term of imprisonment as the first step in the 
20sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph A, the court shall 
21select a definite term of at least 20 years.  The court shall also impose as part of the 
22sentence a period of supervised release to immediately follow that definite term of 
23imprisonment as mandated by section 1881, subsection 1.
243.  Aggravating sentencing factors.  The court shall treat the following as an 
25aggravating sentencing factor.
26A.  If the State pleads and proves that a Class A crime of gross sexual assault was 
27committed by an individual who had previously been convicted and sentenced for a 
28Class B or Class C crime of unlawful sexual contact, or an essentially similar crime 
29in another jurisdiction, the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, shall treat 
30as an aggravating sentencing factor that prior conviction.
31B.  If the State pleads and proves that a violation of section 253, subsection 1 or 2 
32was committed in a safe children zone, the court, in determining the appropriate 
33sentence, shall treat this as an aggravating sentencing factor.
34C.  In using a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 
35individual convicted of violating section 253, a court, in determining the maximum 
36period of incarceration as the 2nd step in the sentencing process specified in section 
371602, subsection 1, paragraph B, shall treat each prior Maine conviction for a 
38violation of section 253 as an aggravating sentencing factor.
39(1)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 
40A, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of 4 
41years of imprisonment.
Page 80 - 129LR0229(01)-11(2)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 
2B, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of 2 
3years of imprisonment.
4(3)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 
5C, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of one 
6year of imprisonment.
7D.  In arriving at the final sentence as the 3rd step in the sentencing process specified 
8in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph C, the court may not suspend that portion of 
9the maximum term of incarceration based on a prior conviction.
10Sec. B-15.  17-A MRSA §282, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
113.  Aggravating sentencing factor of victim under 12 years of age.  If the State 
12pleads and proves that a crime under this section was committed against an individual 
13who had not attained 12 years of age, the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, 
14shall treat the age of the victim as an aggravating sentencing factor.
15Sec. B-16.  17-A MRSA §1125 is enacted to read:
16§1125.  Mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for certain drug offenses
171.  Minimum term of imprisonment.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 
18and 3, for a person convicted of violating section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D or 
191118-A the minimum term of imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows:
20A.  When the sentencing class is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 4 
21years;
22B.  When the sentencing class is Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 2 
23years; and
24C.  With the exception of a conviction under section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C or 
251105-D when the drug that is the basis for the charge is marijuana, when the 
26sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is one year.
272.  Finding by court necessary to impose other than mandatory minimum term 
28of imprisonment.  The court may impose a sentence other than a minimum unsuspended 
29term of imprisonment set forth in subsection 1 if:
30A.  The court finds by substantial evidence that:
31(1)  Imposition of a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
32subsection 1 will result in substantial injustice to the individual.  In making this 
33determination, the court shall consider, among other considerations, whether the 
34individual did not know and reasonably should not have known that the victim 
35was less than 18 years of age;
36(2)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
37subsection 1 will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and
Page 81 - 129LR0229(01)-11(3)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
2subsection 1 will not appreciably impair the effect of subsection 1 in deterring 
3others from violating section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D or 1118-A; and
4B.  The court finds that the individual's background, attitude and prospects for 
5rehabilitation and the nature of the victim and the offense indicate that imposition of 
6a sentence under subsection 1 would frustrate the general purposes of sentencing set 
7forth in section 1501.
8If the court imposes a sentence under this subsection, the court shall state in writing or on 
9the record its reasons for its findings and for imposing a sentence under this subsection 
10rather than under subsection 1.
113.  Reduced mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.  If the court imposes a 
12sentence under subsection 2, the minimum term of imprisonment, which may not be 
13suspended, is as follows:
14A.  When the sentencing class is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 9 
15months;
16B.  When the sentencing class is Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 6 
17months; and
18C.  With the exception of trafficking or furnishing marijuana under section 1105-A or 
191105-C, when the sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is 
203 months.
21Sec. B-17.  17-A MRSA §1126 is enacted to read:
22§1126.  Special sentencing provisions regarding fines for certain drug offenses
231.  Fine based on value of scheduled drugs at time of offense.  As authorized by 
24section 1706, subsection 3, if the State pleads and proves the value at the time of the 
25commission of a crime of a scheduled drug that is the basis for a conviction under section 
261103, 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D, 1106 or 1107-A, the convicted person may be 
27sentenced to pay a fine in an amount up to the value, as pleaded and proved by the State, 
28of that scheduled drug.
292.  Mandatory minimum fine barring court finding exceptional circumstances.  
30In addition to any other authorized sentencing alternative specified in section 1502, 
31subsection 2 for individuals or section 1502, subsection 7 for organizations, the court 
32shall impose a minimum fine of $400, none of which may be suspended, except as 
33provided in subsection 3, for an individual convicted of a crime under section 1103; 
341104; 1105-A; 1105-B; 1105-C; 1105-D; 1106; 1107-A; 1108; 1109; 1110; 1111; 
351111-A, subsection 4-A; 1116; 1117; or 1118.
363.  Finding by court necessary to impose other than minimum fine.  In the case of 
37an individual, the court may suspend all or a portion of a minimum fine under subsection 
382 or impose a fine less than the minimum fine specified in subsection 2 if the court finds 
39by a preponderance of the evidence that there are exceptional circumstances that justify 
Page 82 - 129LR0229(01)-11imposition of a lesser financial penalty.  In making a finding of exceptional 
2circumstances, the court may consider:
3A.  Reliable evidence of financial hardship on the part of the individual and the 
4individual's family and dependents;
5B.  Reliable evidence of special needs of the individual or the individual's family and 
6dependents;
7C.  Reliable evidence of the individual's income and future earning capacity and the 
8individual's assets and financial resources from whatever source;
9D.  Reliable evidence regarding any pecuniary gain derived from the commission of

18nor more than 3 years consecutive to the original suspension.  The penalties may not be 
19suspended except as provided in subsection 3-A.
20A.  If the person has a prior conviction for violating this section within a 10-year 
21period and was subject to the minimum mandatory sentences, then the following 
22minimum penalties, which may not be suspended by the court, apply in the event the 
23suspension was for OUI:
24(1)  A minimum fine of $1,000, a term of imprisonment of 30 consecutive days 
25and a suspension of license for not less than one year nor more than 3 years

2of an individual, the court may suspend all or a portion of a minimum fine under

27the condition set out in Title 17-A, section 1204 1807, subsection 1-A 5.  The court may 
28impose as a condition of probation that a juvenile must reside outside the juvenile's home 
29in a setting satisfactory to the juvenile community corrections officer if the court 
30determines that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for

45under subsection 1, paragraph F may be modified to a disposition under subsection 1, 
Page 101 - 129LR0229(01)-11paragraph H.  When a revocation of probation results in the imposition of a disposition 
2under subsection 1, paragraph F or a period of confinement under subsection 1, paragraph 
3H, the court shall determine whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or 
4eliminate the need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no 
5reasonable efforts are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as 
6defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1-B and whether continuation in the 
7juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  This determination does 
8not affect whether the court orders a particular disposition upon a revocation of probation.  
9If the juvenile is being detained for an alleged violation of probation, the court shall 
10review within 48 hours following the detention, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
11holidays, the decision to detain the juvenile.  Following that review, the court shall order 
12the juvenile's release unless the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the 
13juvenile has violated a condition of probation and finds, by a preponderance of the 
14evidence, that continued detention is necessary to meet one of the purposes of detention 
15under section 3203-A, subsection 4, paragraph C.  When a court orders continued 
16detention, the court shall determine whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent 
17or eliminate the need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no 
18reasonable efforts are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as 
19defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1-B and whether continuation in the 
20juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  This determination does 
21not affect whether the court orders continued detention.
