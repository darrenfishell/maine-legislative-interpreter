Page 1 - 129LR2325(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3 Whereas, there is an urgent need for additional beds for the housing of female 
4 prisoners of the Department of Corrections; and
5 Whereas, there has been a significant reduction in the number of juveniles being 
6 housed at the Long Creek Youth Development Center, resulting in an excess of empty 
7 beds; and
8 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13 Sec. 1.  34-A MRSA §3061, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 148, §7, is 
14 further amended to read:
15 1. Transfer.  The commissioner may transfer any client from one correctional or
16 detention facility or program, including prerelease centers, work release centers, halfway 
17 houses, supervised community confinement or specialized treatment facilities, to another.  
18 A juvenile may not be transferred to another facility or program for adult offenders and 
19 an adult offender may not be transferred to another facility or program for juveniles, 
20 except that an adult offender may be housed in the Long Creek Youth Development 
21 Center or the Mountain View Correctional Facility pursuant to section 3817 or 4117 or 
22 Title 17-A, section 1259.
23 Sec. 2.  34-A MRSA §3817 is enacted to read:
24 §3817.  Confinement of female prisoners
25 The commissioner may confine female prisoners sentenced and committed to the 
26 custody of the department in the facility as long as the housing facilities for female 
27 prisoners are fully separated from the housing facilities for juvenile detainees and 
28 juvenile clients and the commissioner maintains at all times full compliance with 
29 mandatory sight and sound separation standards established by federal law.  All 
30 provisions of this Title that are applicable to prisoners apply to female prisoners confined 
31 in the facility as if they were confined in a correctional facility housing only adults.
32 Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
33 legislation takes effect when approved.
34 SUMMARY
35 This bill allows female adult prisoners to be confined at the Long Creek Youth 
36 Development Center.
