recommendations to address guardianship, conservatorship and authorization of 
transaction challenges that result in extended hospitalization of patients clinically 
qualified for discharge from a hospital; and 
Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that 
the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
legislative session; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it
