21 SUMMARY 
22 The bill generally prohibits an entity within one tier of the 3-tier system of alcohol 
23 distribution in Maine from having a financial interest in an entity within another tier of 
24 the 3-tier system in Maine and extends the fmancial interest prohibitions of the 3-tier 
25 system, which apply under current law to entities that manufacture, import or sell malt 
26 liquor and wine within the State, to entities that manufacture, import or sell spirits within 
27 the State. Under the bill, in-state and out-of-state manufacturers comprise the first tier of 
28 alcohol distribution, in-state and out-of-state wholesalers comprise the 2nd tier of alcohol 
29 distribution and in-state retailers comprise the 3rd tier of alcohol distribution. 
30 This amendment retains the bill's extension of the financial interest prohibitions of 
31 the 3-tier system to spirits but restructures the first and 2nd tiers of that system to match 
32 the structure of the 3-tier system that applies to malt liquor and wine under current 
33 practice. Under the amendment, the first tier of alcohol distribution consists of in-state 
34 manufacturers of spirits, wine or malt liquor; out-of-state manufacturers of spirits, wine 
35 and malt liquor that ship their products to Maine; and out-of-state entities that are not 
36 manufacturers but that purchase spirits, wine or malt liquor for shipment to and eventual 
37 resale in Maine. The 2nd tier of alcohol distribution includes in-state wholesalers of malt 
38 liquor or wine. Because Maine is a control state, private entities are not authorized to act 
39 as wholesalers of spirits within the State and there is therefore no need to include such 
40 entities in the amendment's 2nd tier of alcohol distribution. As in the bill, licensed 
41 retailers comprise the 3rd tier of alcohol distribution.

1 The amendment also corrects an error in the bill by specifying that the prohibited 
2 financial interests between entities in different tiers of the 3-tier system do not include a 
3 minor investment by an entity within one tier of the 3-tier system if that investment 
4 amounts to not more than 1 % of the securities of a business entity within another tier of 
5 the 3-tier system.
