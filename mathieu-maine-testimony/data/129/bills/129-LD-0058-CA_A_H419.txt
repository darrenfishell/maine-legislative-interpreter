Nov-19 General Referendum Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delive1y of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $107,250 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes
