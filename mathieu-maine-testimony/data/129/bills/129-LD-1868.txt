27SUMMARY
28This bill amends the requirement for lobbyists to report expenditures for 
29communications with members of the public urging them to contact elected officials to 
30support or oppose legislation.  The bill changes the term "indirect lobbying" to 
31"grassroots lobbying" and amends its definition.  Current law requires lobbyists to report 
32payments by their clients for indirect lobbying if those payments exceed $15,000 in a 
33month.  The bill reduces the reporting threshold to $2,000 in a calendar month.  The 
34communications subject to the report are expanded to include digital communications, 
35including e-mails, telephone calls and communications by a website or other digital 
36format.  The bill also establishes a requirement for persons who have not engaged a 
37lobbyist to report their financial activities related to grassroots lobbying.  The $2,000 
38threshold applies only to payments to independent contractors and vendors for purposes 
39of grassroots lobbying, such as advertising or website design.  The salaries paid by the 
40person to employees for working on grassroots communications are not applied to the 
Page 3 - 129LR2938(01)-11$2,000 threshold and are exempt from disclosure.  The effective date is December 1, 
22020.
