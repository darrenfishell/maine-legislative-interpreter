In House__________
ORDERED, the Senate concurring, that the Joint Standing Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs shall conduct a study of the Essential Programs and Services Funding Act, the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, chapter 606-B, to determine whether it is meeting the goals 
of providing an appropriate and sufficient level of state funding for public education.  In 
conducting the study, the committee shall invite the participation of interested parties, such as the 
Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, superintendents of school 
administrative units and representatives of municipalities and regional service centers, such as 
town or city managers.  The committee, with input from the interested parties, shall determine a 
method of providing state funds to public schools that is more uniform in application and 
balances the interests of the State and public schools fairly and consistently.  The committee shall 
report out a bill to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature no later than January 15, 
2020 implementing its findings and recommendations.
