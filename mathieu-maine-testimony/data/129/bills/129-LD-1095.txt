Page 1 - 129LR2044(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §107, 2nd ¶, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 
3affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
4If the injured employee elects to claim compensation and benefits under this Act, any 
5employer having paid the compensation or benefits or having become liable for 
6compensation or benefits under any compensation payment scheme has a lien for the 
7value of compensation paid on any damages subsequently recovered against the 3rd 
8person liable for the injury, except that the value of the lien may not exceed the value of 
9damages received by or on behalf of the employee that are attributable to compensation 
10for past or future medical treatment and loss of income or earning capacity. If the 
11employee or the employee's beneficiary fails to pursue the remedy against the 3rd party 
12person within 30 days after written demand by the employer, the employer is subrogated 
13to the rights of the injured employee and is entitled to enforce liability in its own name or 
14in the name of the injured party, the accounting for the proceeds to be made on the basis 
15provided.
16Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §107, last ¶, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 
17affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
18If the employer recovers from a 3rd person damages in excess of the compensation 
19and benefits paid, or for which the employer has become liable, that are attributable to 
20compensation for past or future medical treatment and loss of income or earning capacity, 
21then any excess must be paid to the injured employee, less a proportionate share of the 
22expenses and cost of actions or collection, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
23Settlement of any such subrogation claims and the distribution of the proceeds therefrom 
24must have the approval of the court in which the subrogation action is pending or to 
25which it is returnable; or if not in suit, of the board. When the court in which the 
26subrogation action is pending or to which it is returnable is in vacation, the judge of the 
27court, or, if the action is pending in or returnable to the Superior Court, any Justice of the 
28Superior Court has the power to approve the settlement of the action and the distribution 
29of the proceeds therefrom.  The beneficiary is entitled to reasonable notice and the 
30opportunity to be present in person or by counsel at the approval proceeding.
31SUMMARY
32When a worker suffers an injury or death that is eligible for workers' compensation 
33benefits under the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992 and that is sustained under 
34circumstances that create legal liability for a 3rd person, the injured employee may either 
35claim workers' compensation benefits or seek damages in a civil suit against that 3rd 
36person to recover damages.  Under current law, if the injured employee chooses to claim 
37workers' compensation benefits from the employer, the employer has a lien on any 
38damages subsequently recovered against that 3rd person in the civil action for the value 
39of workers' compensation benefits paid.
40This bill limits the amount of the lien of the employer of the injured or deceased 
41employee to only the value of damages received by or on behalf of the injured or 
Page 2 - 129LR2044(01)-11deceased employee that are attributable to compensation for past or future medical 
2treatment and loss of income or earning capacity.
