FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,g " to H.P. 277, L.D. 351, Bill, "An Act To 
Ensure Accuracy in the Labeling of Maine Meat and Poultry" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA §2157, sub-§15 is enacted to read: 
15. Mislabeling poultry and meat. If it is poultry, a poultry product, meat or a 
meat product offered for sale, sold or distributed within the State and labeled or 
advertised as "Maine-raised" or by a similar designation unless the poultry or animal was 
raised in Maine. A determination that poultry, a poultry product, meat or a meat product 
is misbranded may be waived by the commissioner upon application if the commissioner 
finds a waiver warranted due to economic factors, including, but not limited to, the 
proximity of processing facilities to the in-state poultry producer or meat producer and 
the availability of poultry processing facilities or meat processing facilities in the State. 
For purposes ofthis subsection, "raised in Maine" means: 
A. For poultry and poultry products, that the poultry was raised solely in the State 
from no later than the 7th day after hatching and processed solely in the State; and 
B. For meat and meat products, that: 
(1) The cattle were raised in the State for at least 150 days or the swine were 
raised in the State for at least 100 days; and 
(2) The animal was processed solely in the State. 
As used in this subsection, "poultry," "poultry product," "meat" and "meat product" have 
the same meanings as in section 2511.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively.
