E. A medical practitioner and any other medical or mental health professional 
consulted by the medical practitioner are not liable in a civil action brought by any 
person for any act performed in good faith in execution of the obligations imposed on 
medical practitioners by this section, including any decision regarding the affirmative 
or negative assessment of the likelihood of foreseeable harm. The immunity 
provided in this paragraph also applies to a principal if the medical practitioner or 
professional is acting as an agent or employee of the principal. 
3. Notification by medical practitioner and judicial endorsement. A medical 
practitioner shall notify in writing the law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency 
that, based on the assessment under subsection 2, paragraph B, the person is found to

practitioner's assessment and law enforcement's declarations that the person was taken 
into protective custody and that the law enforcement officer has probable cause that the 
person possesses, controls or may acquire a dangerous weapon. The judge or justice shall 
promptly transmit to the law enforcement officer or agency the decision to endorse or not 
endorse. A decision transmitted electronically has the same legal effect and validity as a 
signed original. An endorsement must authorize law enforcement to execute the 
authority in subsection 4. This section may not be construed to prevent law enforcement 
from accepting a voluntary surrender of dangerous weapons. 
4. Initial restrictions; notice by law enforcement. A person whose assessment is

and 
B. A law enforcement officer shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours

12 store, or make arrangements with another law enforcement agency or federally licensed 
13 :firearms dealer to store, and care for the weapons surrendered by a restricted person in the 
14 manner provided in subsection 7. A restricted person who makes all practical, immediate 
15 efforts to comply with a surrender notice under subsection 4 is not subject to arrest or 
16 prosecution as a prohibited person under Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraph 
17 E-1 or E-2. If a law enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the restricted 
18 person possesses or controls but has not surrendered a weapon, law enforcement may, 
19 prior to or as part of a judicial hearing, search for and seize such a weapon when 
20 authorized by a judicially issued warrant or other circumstances approved by law. 
21 6. Judicial hearing. A judicial hearing under this section is governed by this 
22 subsection. 
23 A. Within 5 days of the date of the notice given to a restricted person under 
24 subsection 4, paragraph B, the district attorney in the district of the restricted person's 
25 residence shall file a petition for judicial review of the initial restrictions by the 
26 district court. The district attorney shall provide to the restricted person written 
27 notice of the petition and hearing at least 7 days prior to the hearing. The restricted 
28 person has the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing, and the court may

33 hearing determining whether to dissolve or extend the initial restrictions, the district 
34 attorney has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the restricted 
35 person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm. 
36 C. In determining whether there are grounds to extend the initial restrictions, the 
37 court shall consider all relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, recent threats 
38 or acts of violence by the restricted person directed toward other persons; recent 
39 threats or acts of violence by the restricted person directed toward the restricted 
40 person; recent acts of unlawful abuse of animals by the restricted person; the reckless 
41 use or threatening display of a dangerous weapon by the restricted person; a history

from abuse or protection from harassment by the restricted person; evidence of 
stalking behavior, severe obsession or sexual violence by the restricted person; the 
illegal use of controlled substances by the restricted person; and evidence of alcohol 
or drug abuse by the restricted person. The court shall also consider whether the 
restricted person is receiving treatment responsive to that person's mental health or 
substance use needs. 
D. This paragraph governs court orders. 
(1) If the court fmds after hearing that there is not clear and convincing evidence 
to continue or extend the initial restrictions, the court shall dissolve the initial 
restrictions and order the return of any weapons surrendered or seized. The court 
shall direct the Department of Public Safety to remove the record of restrictions 
from the department's pertinent database when developed by the department. 
(2) If the court fmds after hearing that there is clear and convincing evidence to 
continue or extend the initial restrictions, the court shall inform the restricted 
person that the restricted person is prohibited for up to one year from purchasing, 
possessing or controlling any dangerous weapon or attempting to purchase, 
possess or control any dangerous weapon. The court shall further order the 
person to immediately surrender dangerous weapons possessed or controlled by 
that person to a law enforcement officer and notify the Department of Public 
Safety for entry in the pertinent database when developed by the department. 
(3) Extended restrictions imposed under this paragraph expire according to the 
terms of the court's order. The court shall schedule a hearing within 45 days prior 
to the expiration of the order to determine if the order should be extended. The 
district attorney has the burden of proving that the restricted person continues to 
pose a likelihood of foreseeable harm. If, after a hearing, the court finds by clear 
and convincing evidence that the restricted person continues to pose a likelihood 
of foreseeable harm, the court shall renew the extended restrictions for up to one 
year. If the court does not so find, the court shall deny the petition and order the 
return of any weapons surrendered or seized. Upon motion by the State, the court 
may for cause shown order that the restricted person be examined for assessment 
of whether the restricted person continues to pose a likelihood of foreseeable 
harm. The fees or expenses for an assessment pursuant to this subparagraph may 
be paid from the Extradition and Prosecution Expenses Account established by 
Title 15, section 224-A. 
(4) A restricted person may file one motion for dissolution during an extended 
restriction. For that motion, the restricted person has the burden of proving by 
clear and convincing evidence that the restricted person no longer poses a 
likelihood of foreseeable harm.

Safety, Bureau of State Police an abstract of the order issued by the court 
pursuant to this section that includes a prohibition on the possession of a 
Page 5 -129LR2536(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "J.\ "to S.P. 612, L.D. 1811 ( '> j' ;,-7) 
dangerous weapon. The abstract must include the name, date of birth and gender 
2 of the person who is the subject of the order; the court's order and the expiration 
3 date of that order; and a notation that the person has been notified by the court. 
4 The abstract required by this subparagraph is confidential and is not a public 
5 record as defined in Title 1, chapter 13; however, the information contained in 
6 the abstract or a copy of the abstract may be provided by the Department of 
7 Public Safety to a criminal justice agency for law enforcement purposes, to the 
8 Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Instant Criminal Background Check 
9 System or to an issuing authority for the purpose of processing concealed firearm 
10 permit applications. The Department of Public Safety shall, when the pertinent 
11 database is developed, request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ensure 
12 that, immediately after the order expires, the National Instant Criminal 
13 Background Check System no longer reflects that expired order as a ground for 
14 prohibiting the subject of the order from possessing or acquiring a firearm. For 
15 the purposes of this subsection, "criminal justice agency" means a federal, state, 
16 tribal, district, county or local government agency or any subunit of those entities 
17 that performs the administration of criminal justice under a statute or executive 
18 order and that allocates a substantial part of its annual budget to the 
19 administration of criminal justice. Courts and the Department of the Attorney 
20 General are considered criminal justice agencies, as is any equivalent agency at 
21 any level of Canadian government. 
22 (6) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prevent the restricted person, 
23 district attorney and court from accepting a court-ordered disposition to which 
24 each agrees. 
25 7. Weapons storage and return. A law enforcement agency may store, or make 
26 arrangements with another law enforcement agency or federally licensed firearms dealer 
27 to store, any weapon surrendered to or seized by law enforcement under this section for 
28 as long as the threat-based restrictions are in effect. The duties and liability of a law 
29 enforcement agency with respect to handling and storage of a weapon surrendered or 
30 seized are governed by Title 25, section 2804-C, subsection 2-C. A weapon surrendered 
31 to or seized by a law enforcement agency must be returned to the restricted person when 
32 the threat-based restrictions expire. If a seized or surrendered weapon remains unclaimed 
33 for 6 months after the expiration or dissolution of threat-based restrictions, the law 
34 enforcement agency may dispose of the weapon consistent with Title 25, section 3503-A. 
35 8. Offense. Possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person is a Class D 
36 crime.

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill but retains the purpose of providing an alternative 
to law enforcement to take into protective custody and have assessed a person who 
presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm to the person or to others. 
"Likelihood of foreseeable harm" is defined as a substantial risk in the foreseeable 
future of serious physical harm to the person as manifested by recent behaviors or threats 
of, or attempts at, suicide or serious self-inflicted harm; or a substantial risk in the 
foreseeable future of serious physical harm to other persons as manifested by recent 
homicidal or violent behavior or by recent conduct or statements placing others in 
reasonable fear of serious physical harm. 
The law enforcement officer is directed to have the person in protective custody 
assessed by a medical practitioner. If the assessment finds that the person presents a 
likelihood of foreseeable harm, the law enforcement officer must seek an endorsement 
from a judicial officer that the person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm, which 
authorizes law enforcement to notify the person that the person is a restricted person and 
is prohibited from possessing, controlling, acquiring or attempting to possess, control or 
acquire a dangerous weapon pending the outcome of a judicial hearing. The restricted 
person must immediately and temporarily surrender any weapon possessed, controlled or 
acquired by the restricted person to a law enforcement officer. 
A restricted person who makes all practical and immediate efforts to comply with a 
surrender notice is not subject to arrest or prosecution as a prohibited person under the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraph E-1 or E-2. If a 
law enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the restricted person possesses or 
controls but has not surrendered a weapon, law enforcement may, prior to or as part of a 
judicial hearing, search for and seize such a weapon when authorized by a judicially 
issued warrant or other circumstances approved by law. 
The district attorney is required to file a petition for judicial review of the initial 
restrictions by the District Court. Within 14 days of the notice of restricted status given 
to the restricted person, the court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether to 
dissolve or extend the initial restrictions. The restricted person has the right to be 
represented by counsel. The district attorney has the burden of proving by clear and 
convincing evidence that the restricted person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm. 
The court may dissolve the initial restrictions or extend them for up to one year. 
This amendment directs the executive branch to work with medical practitioners and 
law enforcement to develop and release, by January 1, 2020, a request for proposals for 
the development and acquisition of the technology necessary to enable assessments under 
Title 34-B, section 3862-A at locations other than health care facilities. 
By February 1, 2020, the Department of Public Safety must develop a plan, including 
any cost estimates, to implement a database system to support this legislation. 
The provisions for assessments for likelihood of foreseeable harm and restricted 
person status take effect July 1, 2020.
