15 SUMMARY 
16 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, amends the bill to 
17 remove conflicts with other provisions in statute relating to consent by minors. Current 
18 law provides that the treatment of a minor for a sexually transmitted infection does not 
19 require the consent of the minor's parent or guardian. The amendment provides that the 
20 prevention or treatment of a sexually transmitted infection does not require the consent of 
21 the minor's parent or guardian. The amendment clarifies that the provisions of the Maine 
22 Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 406 regarding family planning services are not 
23 intended to change the scope of practice of a health care provider. It also makes other 
24 technical changes.
