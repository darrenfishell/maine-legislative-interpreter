This bill requires the Deparhnent of Education to contract for the services necessary to develop and implement an 
Internet-based application for free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program and the School 
Breakfast Program and make the application available to local school administrative units (SAU's). According to the 
department, Internet-based applications are available and, therefore, there is no need to develop one. The department 
will hire a vendor through a request for proposal process to maintain the application and deliver it to SAU's. 
The bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $216,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to the 
School Finance and Operations program within the Deparhnent of Education to contract for the services necessary to 
provide the Internet-based application for free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program and 
the School Breakfast Program to public schools. This estimate assumes that the 216 SAU's currently in the programs 
will choose to use, and be provided with, the Internet-based application and that the cost for the vendor to maintain 
the software will be $1,000 per school aimually.
