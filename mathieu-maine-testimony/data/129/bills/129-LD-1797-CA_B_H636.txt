SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. Like the bill, the 
amendment allows a commercial track, an off-track betting facility and a 
multijurisdictional account wagering provider to obtain a license to conduct advance 
deposit wagering. Unlike the bill, which requires the Department of Public Safety, 
Gambling Control Board to set the tax rate on advance deposit wagering by rule, the 
amendment requires advance deposit wagering licensees to remit 0.5% of the licensees' 
gross advance deposit wagering income to the Department of Public Safety, Gambling 
Control Board for distribution by the board. An entity that operates advance deposit 
wagering may not receive a distribution of gross advance deposit wagering income. 
The amendment also requires licensure of employees of advance deposit wagering 
licensees, makes several technical changes to add clarity to the bill and adds an 
appropriations and allocations section.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill repeals provisions in current law that directed the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of 
Public Safety to award one entity through a competitive bidding process a license to conduct advance deposit 
wagering and instead allows commercial tracks, off-track betting facilities and multijurisdictional account wagering 
providers to be licensed to participate in advance deposit wagering. Advance deposit wagering licensees are directed 
to remit .5% of their gross advance deposit wagering income to the GCU for distribution as follows: 
Credited to the General Fund 
Fund to Stabilize Off-Track Betting Facilities (OSR) 
Sire Stakes Fund (OSR) 
Agricultural Fair Support Fund (OSR) 
Fund to Supplement Harness Racing Purses (OSR) Of the .5% remitted for:

The State's share of the advance deposit wagering in fiscal year 2019-20 is anticipa~ed to generate only $300 in 
revenue of which $30 will be credited to the General Fund and $270 will be distributed into the various Other Special 
Revenue Funds accounts listed above. In fiscal year 2020-21, General Fund revenue is estimated to be $32 and Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue is estimated to be $284. Corresponding Other Special Revenue Funds allocations are 
included to allow for the expenditure of the funds. 
License and application fees are estimated to generate $22,500 in fiscal year 2019-20 with additional revenue in 
fiscal year 2024-25 when the 5-year licenses are renewed. License fee revenue assumes that five off-track betting 
facilities and 10 multijurisdictional account wagering providers will seek licensure. This bill also includes 
appropriations to the GCU of$93,046 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $127,628 in fiscal year 2020-21 for one Public 
Safety Manager II position and associated All Other costs.
