Page 1 - 129LR0404(01)-11Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Public Utilities Commission has recently changed the rules governing 
4net energy billing in a way that discourages customers from generating and consuming 
5their own renewable energy; and
6Whereas, the costs and complexities of implementing these rule changes are 
7disruptive to customers; and
8Whereas, passage of this legislation as emergency legislation will protect electricity 
9customers from additional costs; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
15Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง3209-A, as corrected by RR 2017, c. 1, ยง32, is repealed and 
16the following enacted in its place:
17ยง3209-A.  Net energy billing
18An eligible customer may elect net energy billing for the customer's accounts or 
19meters in accordance with this section.
201.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
21following terms have the following meanings.
22A.  "Eligible customer" means a person or an entity that takes electricity service 
23through a transmission and distribution utility and that owns or has an interest in an 
24eligible facility located in that transmission and distribution utility's service territory.
25B.  "Eligible facility" means an electric generating facility that meets eligibility 
26requirements established by the commission by rule.
27C.  "Gross output" means all of the energy generated by an eligible facility during an 
28applicable period, including all energy that is used to offset the usage of eligible 
29customers.
30D.  "Net energy" means the difference between the kilowatt-hours delivered by the 
31transmission and distribution utility to an eligible customer over a billing period and 
32the kilowatt-hours exported by the customer from an eligible facility to the 
33transmission and distribution system over the same billing period.
34E.  "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which eligible 
35customers are billed on the basis of net energy over the billing period taking into 
36account accumulated unused kilowatt-hour credits from the previous billing period.
Page 2 - 129LR0404(01)-11F.  "Total retail rate" means, with respect to an eligible customer's bill during a billing 
2period, the sum of the rate charged for any kilowatt-hours supplied through standard-
3offer or competitive electricity provider service and the rate charged by the 
4transmission and distribution utility for its service to that eligible customer.
52.  Billing; metering; data collection.  A transmission and distribution utility:
6A.  Shall credit all kilowatt-hours exported from an eligible facility to the 
7transmission and distribution system over a billing period by an eligible customer 
8participating in net energy billing at the total retail rate for that electricity; and
9B.  May not require an eligible customer to meter the gross output of an eligible 
10facility or to have a meter installed to record gross output in order to participate in net 
11energy billing but may collect gross output data from an eligible customer if a meter 
12to record gross output of the eligible customer's eligible facility was installed prior to 
13the effective date of this section.
143.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules governing net energy billing to 
15implement this section.  Rules adopted or amended under this section are routine 
16technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
17Sec. 2.  Rulemaking.  The Public Utilities Commission shall amend its net energy 
18billing rules within 90 days of the effective date of this Act to conform with the changes 
19to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A under this Act.
20Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
21legislation takes effect when approved.
22SUMMARY
23This bill prohibits a transmission and distribution utility from requiring a customer to 
24meter the gross output of a facility for net energy billing purposes and from requiring a 
25customer to have a meter installed to measure gross output in order to participate in net 
26energy billing.  The bill requires that a net energy billing customer be credited for 
27kilowatt-hours exported from an eligible facility at the total retail rate for electricity.  It 
28allows a transmission and distribution utility to collect data on gross output only if a 
29meter to measure gross output was installed prior to the effective date of this legislation.  
30Finally, it requires the Public Utilities Commission to amend its rules to conform with the 
31changes made in this legislation within 90 days of the effective date.
