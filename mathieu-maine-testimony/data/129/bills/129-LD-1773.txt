Page 1 - 129LR2322(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §3802, sub-§12, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. 
3VVVVV, §6, is amended to read:
412.  Bonding authority; debt limitation; allocation and payment of approved 
5debt.  A school management and leadership center may issue bonds and notes for school 
6construction purposes. For purposes of this section, "school construction purposes" 
7includes minor capital costs relating to maintenance of a school's physical plant. The 
8school management and leadership center board shall decide whether the issuance of 
9bonds or notes by the school management and leadership center for school construction 
10purposes is necessary. The board shall determine whether the issuance of bonds or notes 
11is authorized, and, if so, the board shall issue the bonds or notes and administer the 
12proceeds of, and the payment of principal of and interest on, those bonds or notes after 
13issuance. A school management and leadership center may issue bonds and notes for 
14school construction purposes only under the provisions of the interlocal agreement under 
15section 3801, subsection 3.  Upon receiving authorization to issue bonds or notes under 
16the election procedures of the interlocal agreement, the board shall follow the 
17requirements of section 1490 for issuing bonds or notes of the school management and 
18leadership center.
19A.  Indebtedness of a school management and leadership center for school 
20construction purposes may not exceed 4% of the total state valuation of the 
21participating municipalities. For purposes of this section, "participating 
22municipalities" of a school management and leadership center includes all municipal 
23school units that are members of the school management and leadership center and 
24the municipalities constituting the other members of the school management and 
25leadership center. The debt limitation is determined as of the date the state board 
26issues a project concept approval or in the case of a nonstate funded project the date 
27the commissioner approves the project under section 15905-A.  Debt of a school 
28management and leadership center is outside the debt limitations of its members and 
29of municipalities constituting its members.
30B.  For purposes of determining a debt limitation under this subsection, debt 
31approved for state subsidy is excluded. However, in cases in which one or more 
32participating municipalities receive an adjustment for the minimum state allocation 
33pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1, each outstanding state-subsidized debt 
34allocable to a participating municipality that does not receive an adjustment for the 
35minimum state allocation pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1 is excluded from 
36the debt limitation, but only the state reimbursable portion of each outstanding 
37state-subsidized debt allocable to a participating municipality that receives an 
38adjustment for the minimum state allocation pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1 
39is excluded.
40C.  For purposes of determining the debt limitation exclusion under paragraph B, 
41when at least one participating municipality receives an adjustment for the minimum 
42state allocation pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1, each issue of debt approved 
43for purposes of state subsidy is allocated in proportion to the fiscal capacities of the 
44school management and leadership center members. In the case of each school 
Page 2 - 129LR2322(01)-11management and leadership center member that is a regional school unit, school 
2administrative district or community school district, the amount of each fiscal 
3capacity allocation under this subsection is allocated to the municipalities constituting 
4the member in proportion to the municipalities' pupil counts in accordance with 
5section 15688, subsection 2.  For each participating municipality that receives an 
6adjustment for the minimum state allocation pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1, 
7the state reimbursable portion of an outstanding state-subsidized debt allocable to that 
8participating municipality is the product of the amount of that school management 
9and leadership center's debt allocated to the participating municipality under this 
10section and the member's state share percentage, as defined in section 15672, 
11subsection 31.
12D.  For purposes of determining a debt limitation under this subsection, a certificate 
13from the commissioner that a project qualifies for state school construction aid, as to 
14the amount of debt that qualifies for that aid, as to the allocation of the debt to the 
15members of the school management and leadership center, as to the allocation of debt 
16to any participating municipality and as to the state share percentage for any 
17participating municipality that receives an adjustment for the minimum state 
18allocation pursuant to section 15689, subsection 1 is conclusive evidence of the facts 
19stated in the certificate.
20E.  The commissioner shall determine the state allocation for debt service costs by 
21allocating the principal and interest payments for each debt approved for purposes of 
22state subsidy among the members of the school management and leadership center in 
23proportion to the members' fiscal capacities.  The adjustment for debt service under 
24section 15689, subsection 2 applies to the debt service allocated to participating 
25municipalities under this subsection.  Each member's state allocation for debt service 
26costs must be paid by the commissioner as provided by section 15907.  The principal 
27and interest payments on debt approved for purposes of state subsidy must be shared 
28by the members of the school management and leadership center in accordance with 
29the commissioner's allocation under this paragraph notwithstanding the cost-sharing 
30formula of the school management and leadership center.
31Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §3802, sub-§12-A is enacted to read:
3212-A.  General obligation debt; assessment and collection; withdrawal.  In the 
33case of a school management and leadership center authorized to issue bonds or notes 
34under the terms of an interlocal agreement, the following provisions apply.
35A.  Bonds and notes issued by a school management and leadership center are general 
36obligations of the school management and leadership center.  The provisions of 
37sections 15695 and 15695-A apply, including provisions for the assessment and 
38collection of taxes, the levy of ad valorem taxes without limit as to rate or amount 
39upon all taxable property within the school management and leadership center and 
40the rights and protection of bondholders.
41B.  A school management and leadership center board shall include in each budget an 
42amount sufficient to pay debt service on approved bonds or notes.  The cost-sharing, 
43assessment and payment process under section 3801, subsection 3, paragraph A, 
44subparagraph (4) must include determining debt service amounts, except that the 
Page 3 - 129LR2322(01)-11principal and interest payments on debt approved for purposes of state subsidy are 
2shared by the members of the school management and leadership center in 
3accordance with the commissioner's allocation under subsection 12.  The school 
4budget of each member must include an amount that is its share of the school 
5management and leadership center costs, including debt service costs.  Each member 
6shall raise and assess a sufficient amount for its share of annual debt service not paid 
7from other sources and may collect those amounts in the manner provided by law for 
8school taxes.  If the treasurer of a member fails to timely pay any installment by the 
9date required, the school management and leadership center has the same rights and 
10remedies of enforcement, including interest, court costs and attorney's fees, and the 
11court has the same powers, as is provided for enforcement of regional school unit 
12installments under section 1489, subsection 6.
13C.  Whenever a member withdraws from a school management and leadership center 
14having outstanding indebtedness, including bonds, notes and lease-purchase 
15agreements, the school management and leadership center remains intact for purposes 
16of securing and retiring the indebtedness. A withdrawal agreement may provide for 
17alternate means for retiring outstanding indebtedness.
18SUMMARY
19This bill amends the law governing bonding authority of school management and 
20leadership centers.  The bill provides the provisions necessary to implement existing 
21statutory authority of school management and leadership centers to issue bonds for school 
22construction.  These provisions are comparable to existing law for school construction 
23bonds issued by school administrative units or by career and technical education regions.  
24The bonding provisions include a debt limit of 4% of state-adjusted valuation; a debt limit 
25exclusion for state-subsidized debt; a 25-year maximum bond term; a method for debt 
26allocation, assessment and collection; and the rights of bondholders to enforce the 
27payment of bonds to facilitate their sale.
