§2093. Operation of pedal-powered tour vehicles 
A person may not operate a pedal-powered tour vehicle on any portion of a public 
way that is not in a municipality, A person operating a pedal-powered tour vehicle on a 
public way in a municipality shall comply with the operational restrictions established in 
this section and the licensing requirements in section 116. 
1. Designated operation zones. A municipality that issues a commercial pedal car 
business license shall designate zones of operation within the municipality where pedal­
powered tour vehicles are permitted to operate. A pedal-powered tour vehicle may not be 
operated on a public way that is not part of a zone of operation designated by a 
municipality. 
A municipality may not designate for the operation of pedal-powered tour vehicles any 
portion of a public way with a speed limit above 15 miles per hour except for a portion of 
a public way at an intersection that must be crossed in order to connect sections of a 
designated zone of operation. 
2. Operator restrictions. Except to make a left tum, the operator of a pedal­
powered tour vehicle on a public way shall keep the vehicle as close to the right curb or 
edge of the public way as practicable. 
Nothing in this subsection exempts the operator of a pedal-powered tour vehicle from 
other rules of operation established under this chapter or prevents a municipality from 
establishing additional restrictions on the operation of pedal-powered tour vehicles. 
Sec. 7. 29-A MRSA §2112-A, sub-§4 is enacted to read: 
4. Pedal-powered tour vehicles. The operator of a pedal-powered tour vehicle on a 
public way is subject to every provision in this section related to the operation of a 
vehicle or motor vehicle on a public way. A municipality that allows the operation of 
pedal-powered tour vehicles may establish additional restrictions related to open 
alcoholic beverage containers and the consumption of alcohol by passengers on a pedal­
powered tour vehicle.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment restricts a person from operating 
a pedal-powered tour vehicle on any portion of a public way that is not within a 
municipality, defines "pedal-powered tour vehicle" and exempts pedal-powered tour 
vehicles from the definition of "motor vehicle." It subjects the operator of a pedal­
powered tour vehicle to the open container laws and allows a municipality to establish 
additional restrictions related to open alcoholic beverage containers and the consumption 
of alcohol by passengers on a pedal-powered tour vehicle. The amendment also creates 
equipment requirements for the operation of pedal-powered tour vehicles and creates 
licensing requirements, which include proof of insurance, for any municipality that 
allows the operation of pedal-powered tour vehicles.
