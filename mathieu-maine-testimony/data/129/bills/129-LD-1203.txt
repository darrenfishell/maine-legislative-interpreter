Page 1 - 129LR2084(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §223, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 
3affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
41.  Presumption.  An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving 
5nondisability pension or retirement benefits under either a private or governmental 
6pension or retirement program, including old-age benefits under the United States Social 
7Security Act, 42 United States Code, Sections 301 to 1397f, that was paid by or on behalf 
8of an employer from whom weekly benefits under this Act are sought is presumed not to 
9have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of compensable injury or disease 
10under this Act.  This presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of evidence 
11that the employee is unable, terminated active employment at least in part because of a 
12work-related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee's qualifications, 
13including training or experience.  This standard of disability supersedes other applicable 
14standards used to determine disability under this Act.
15SUMMARY
16Once an individual receiving workers' compensation benefits retires and is receiving 
17retirement benefits, there is a presumption that the individual is no longer eligible for 
18workers' compensation benefits related to loss of earnings or earning capacity.  Under 
19current law, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the individual is unable to 
20perform suitable work because of the work-related disability.
21This bill lowers the evidentiary burden on the retired individual collecting workers' 
22compensation benefits by providing that evidence that the individual's retirement was due 
23at least in part to a work-related disability is sufficient to continue eligibility for workers' 
24compensation benefits related to loss of earnings or earning capacity.
