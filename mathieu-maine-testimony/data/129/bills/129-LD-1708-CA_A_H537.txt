129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 1220, L.D. 1708, Bill, "An Act To 
Provide for the Merger of Hospital Administrative District No. 4 into MRH Corp., a 
Maine Nonprofit, Nonstock Private Corporation" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the Legislature created Hospital Administrative District No. 4 by Private 
and Special Law 1973, chapter 76, in order to provide for the health, welfare and public 
benefit of the inhabitants of the district; and 
Whereas, the district has determined that it is unable to continue to fulfill its 
purpose of providing for the health, welfare and public benefit of the inhabitants of the 
district unless it is affiliated with a strong, integrated health care system; and 
Whereas, the district has decided that it would be in the best interest of the district 
to affiliate with Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems, doing business as Northern Light 
Health, because of its experience of successfully operating other critical access hospitals 
and the opportunity to create a network with other Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems' 
hospitals located in the Piscataquis region to continue and improve the delivery of highÂ­
quality health care to the inhabitants of the district and the entire Piscataquis region; and 
Whereas, as authorized by the affirmative votes of their respective governing 
boards, the district and Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems have entered into an 
agreement and plan of merger dated March 19, 2019 setting forth the terms and 
conditions by which the district will merge into MRH Corp., a Maine nonprofit, nonstock 
private corporation having Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems as its sole member, as soon 
as reasonably practicable; and 
Whereas, in advisory votes held during April 2019 at town meetings in 12 towns 
and at a town council meeting in one town comprising the district, 12 of the 13 towns,

1 representing 97.4% of the population of the district, indicated their approval of the 
2 merger of the district; and 
3 Whereas, it is in the public interest for the district to be able to merge into MRH 
4 Corp. as soon as practicable, as long as all conditions and the parties' respective 
5 obligations under the agreement and law are satisfied, to ensure the continuation of the 
6 provision for the health, welfare and public benefit of the inhabitants of the district; and 
7 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, this merger is in the public interest; 
8 and 
9 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12 therefore, 
13 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
