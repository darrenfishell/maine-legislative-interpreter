Provisions in this bill would transfer 25% of sales and excise tax receipts to the Local Government Marijuana Revenue 
Fund (LGMRF). The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $968,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and 
$3,696,000 in fiscal year 2020-20 to allow for the distribution of the amounts credited to the LGMRF. Transferring 
sales and excise tax receipts to the LGMRF will reduce revenue to the General Fund by the same amounts, $968,000 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $3,696,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
The bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services of 
$78,520 in 2019-20 and $104,600 in fiscal year 2020-21 for one Senior Tax Examiner position to process transfers of 
sales and excise tax receipts on adult use marijuana. Another $5,000 is appropriated in the first year for one-time All 
Other costs to update sales reports and create an excise tax report to facilitate distribution to municipalities. 
Other provisions in this bill regarding ownership requirements may result in litigation which could incur additional 
costs and delay implementation. Such a delay would decrease anticipated revenue to the State and the distribution of 
funds.
