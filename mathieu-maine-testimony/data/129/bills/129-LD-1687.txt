Page 1 - 129LR2428(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, Graham Lake in the City of Ellsworth is an impoundment lake that is 
4created by a privately owned dam for the purpose of generating electricity; and
5Whereas, the water level of the lake can fluctuate substantially depending on the 
6dam owner's need to generate electricity and other seasonal factors; and
7Whereas, there are many recreational users of the lake and waterfront homes with 
8docks that in the past several years have been left dry due to extremely low water levels; 
9and
10Whereas, the next recreation season is likely to commence well before the 
11expiration of the 90-day period; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §464, sub-§9-A, ¶C-1 is enacted to read:
18C-1.  For the purposes of water quality certification under the Federal Water 
19Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92-500, Section 401, as amended, and licensing of 
20modifications under section 636, Graham Lake, located in the Union River, main 
21stem, is deemed to have met the habitat characteristics and aquatic life criteria in the 
22existing impoundment if that habitat and aquatic life satisfy the aquatic life criteria 
23contained in section 465, subsection 3, paragraph C, except that habitat and aquatic 
24life in the portions of the water body affected by annual drawdowns of up to 4 feet 
25may reflect the effects of such drawdowns, based on a use attainability analysis 
26conducted by the board pursuant to subsection 2-A.
27Sec. 2.  Volitional upstream fish passage for Ellsworth Lake and Graham 
28Lake.  For the purposes of water quality certification of the multistation hydropower 
29facility at the Ellsworth Hydroelectric Project, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
30Project Number 2727, under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92-
31500, Section 401, as amended, and licensing of modifications under the Maine Revised 
32Statutes, Title 38, section 636, and any other licensing proceeding affecting the project, 
33the failure to install a volitional upstream fish passage for anadromous fish species at 
34Ellsworth Lake Dam and Graham Lake Dam within 10 years of federal relicensure of the 
35project constitutes a revocation of a water quality certification under the Federal Water 
36Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92-500, Section 401.  For purposes of this section, 
37"volitional upstream fish passage" means a fish passage in which a fish swims upstream 
38past an obstruction under the fish's own volition rather than being trapped and hauled 
39around the obstruction by means other than the fish's own volition.
Page 2 - 129LR2428(01)-11Sec. 3.  Department of Environmental Protection water quality 
2certification of Ellsworth Hydroelectric Project.  The Department of 
3Environmental Protection may not waive water quality certification authority under the 
4Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92-500, Section 401, as amended, for 
5any state or federal licensing regarding the Ellsworth Hydroelectric Project, Federal 
6Energy Regulatory Commission Project Number 2727, and shall file any water quality 
7certification issued by the department to the United States Environmental Protection 
8Agency for approval under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.  A failure of the 
9Department of Environmental Protection to file timely a water quality certification with 
10the United States Environmental Protection Agency under this section is deemed to be a 
11denial of water quality certification by the department for state and federal licensing 
12purposes.
13Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
14legislation takes effect when approved.
15SUMMARY
16This bill provides that for the purposes of water quality certification under the Federal 
17Water Pollution Control Act:
181.  Graham Lake located in the Union River in the City of Ellsworth may be subject 
19to drawdowns of lake levels of up to 4 feet and still be deemed to meet state water 
20classification standards;
212.  The Department of Environmental Protection may not waive water quality 
22certification under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for the Federal Energy 
23Regulatory Commission license for the Ellsworth Hydroelectric Project and failure of the 
24department to file timely a water quality certification is deemed to be a denial of water 
25quality certification; and
263.  The Ellsworth Hydroelectric Project is subject to an involuntary water quality 
27decertification if the project does not provide for a volitional upstream fish passage over 
28both the Graham Lake Dam and Ellsworth Lake Dam within 10 years of the project's 
29relicensure.
