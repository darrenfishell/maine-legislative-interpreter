Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Although no immediate unfunded liability is created by the provisions of this bill, excluding salary or wage increases 
obtained as a result of collective bargaining or a job promotion from the cap on earnings used in the calculation of a 
member's average final compensation when determining a member's retirement benefit may result in increased future 
pension costs to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System if the earnings used in the calculation of retirement 
benefits because of this bill exceed the earnings assumptions used to estimate pension costs. The impact can not be 
determined at this time and will depend on actual experience.
