16terminated, for the employer an experience rating record, to which are credited all the 
17contributions that the employer pays on the employer's own behalf. This chapter may 
18not be construed to grant any employer or individuals in the employer's service prior 
19claims or rights to the amounts paid by the employer into the fund. Benefits paid to 
20an eligible individual under the Employment Security Law must be charged against 
21the experience rating record of the claimant's most recent subject employer, except 
22that, beginning January 1, 2022, benefits paid to an eligible individual under the 
23Employment Security Law must be charged against the experience rating record of 
24the claimant's employers in a ratio inversely proportional to the claimant's 
25employment beginning with the most recent employer, or to the General Fund if the 
26otherwise chargeable experience rating record is that of an employer whose status as 
27such has been terminated; except that no charge may be made to an individual 
28employer but must be made to the General Fund if the commission finds that: 
29(1)  The claimant's separation from the claimant's last employer was for 
30misconduct in connection with the claimant's employment or was voluntary 
31without good cause attributable to the employer; 
32(2)  The claimant has refused to accept reemployment in suitable work when 
33offered by a previous employer, without good cause attributable to the employer; 
34(3)  Benefits paid are not chargeable against any employer's experience rating 
35record in accordance with section 1194, subsection 11, paragraphs B and C; 
36(5)  Reimbursements are made to a state, the Virgin Islands or Canada for 
37benefits paid to a claimant under a reciprocal benefits arrangement as authorized 
38in section 1082, subsection 12, as long as the wages of the claimant transferred to 
39the other state, the Virgin Islands or Canada under such an arrangement are less 
Page 2 - 129LR3028(01)-11than the amount of wages for insured work required for benefit purposes by 
2section 1192, subsection 5;
3(6)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
4open by a Legislator given a leave of absence under chapter 7, subchapter 5-A, 
5and the claimant's separation from this employer was because the employer 
6restored the Legislator to the position after the Legislator's leave of absence as 
7required by chapter 7, subchapter 5-A; 
8(7)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
9open by an individual who left to enter active duty in the United States military, 
10and the claimant's separation from this employer was because the employer 
11restored the military serviceperson to the person's former employment upon 
12separation from military service;
13(8)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
14open by an individual given a leave of absence for family medical leave provided 
15under Maine or federal law, and the claimant's separation from this employer was 
16because the employer restored the individual to the position at the completion of 
17the leave; or
18(9)  The claimant initiated a partial separation or reduction of hours and that 
19partial separation or reduction of hours was agreed to by the employee and 
20employer.
21Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §1221, sub-§3, ¶C-2 is enacted to read:
22C-2.  For the purposes of paragraph A, the experience rating record of the most recent 
23subject employer may not be charged with benefits paid to a claimant whose work 
24record with that employer totaled 5 consecutive weeks or less of total or partial 
25employment, in which case the most recent subject employer with whom the 
26claimant's work record exceeded 5 consecutive weeks of total or partial employment 
27must be charged if that employer would have otherwise been chargeable had not 
28subsequent employment intervened.
29Sec. 3.  26 MRSA §1221, sub-§4-A, ¶C, as amended by PL 2007, c. 352, Pt. A, 
30§2, is further amended to read:
31C.  The commissioner shall:
32(1)  Promptly notify each employer of the employer's rate of contributions as 
33determined for the 12-month period commencing January 1st of each year.  The 
34determination is conclusive and binding upon the employer unless within 30 days 
35after notice of the determination is mailed to the employer's last known address 
36or, in the absence of mailing, within 30 days after the delivery of the notice, the 
37employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the 
38employer's reasons.  If the commission Division of Administrative Hearings 
39grants the review, the employer must be promptly notified and must be granted 
40an opportunity for a hearing.  An employer does not have standing in any 
41proceedings involving the employer's rate of contributions or contribution 
42liability to contest the chargeability to the employer's experience rating record of 
Page 3 - 129LR3028(01)-11any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision 
2pursuant to section 1194, except upon the ground that the services for which 
3benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in 
4employment for the employer and only when the employer was not a party to the 
5determination, redetermination or decision or to any other proceedings under this 
6chapter in which the character of the services was determined.  The employer 
7must be promptly notified of the commission's Division of Administrative 
8Hearings' denial of the employer's application or the commission's 
9redetermination, both of which are subject to appeal pursuant to Title 5, chapter 
10375, subchapter 7, which is subject to appeal pursuant to section 1226; and
11(2)  Provide each employer at least monthly with a notification of benefits paid 
12and chargeable to the employer's experience rating record.  In the absence of an 
13application for redetermination filed in the manner and within the period 
14prescribed by the commission 30 days after the notification was mailed, a 
15notification is conclusive and binding upon the employer for all purposes.  A 
16redetermination made after notice and opportunity for hearing and the 
17commission's findings of fact may be introduced in subsequent administrative or 
18judicial proceedings involving the determination of the rate of contributions of an 
19employer for the 12-month period commencing January 1st of any year and has 
20the same finality as provided in this section with respect to the findings of fact 
21made by the commission in proceedings to redetermine the contribution rates of 
22an employer Any request for reconsideration must be made in accordance with 
23section 1226.
24Sec. 4.  26 MRSA §1221, sub-§11, ¶D, as amended by PL 1979, c. 651, §28, is 
25further amended to read:

27conclusive on the employer or governmental entity, unless not later than 15 days after 
28the assessment was mailed to the last known address, the employer or governmental 
29entity files an application for redetermination by the commission Division of 
30Administrative Hearings setting forth the grounds for such application.
31Sec. 5.  26 MRSA §1225, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1993, c. 312, §3, is further 
32amended to read:
332.  Jeopardy assessment. If the Director of Unemployment Compensation 
34determines that the collection of any contribution, interest or penalty under this 
35subchapter, as amended, will be jeopardized by delay, the director may immediately 
36assess the contributions, interest or penalties, whether or not the time prescribed by law or 
37any rules issued pursuant to section 1082, subsection 2, for making reports and paying the 
38contributions has expired, and shall give written notice of the assessment to the employer. 
39In these cases, the right to appeal to the commission Division of Administrative Hearings, 
40as provided in section 1226, is conditioned upon payment of the contributions, interest or 
41penalties so assessed, or upon giving appropriate security to the commissioner for the 
42payment thereof.
Page 4 - 129LR3028(01)-11Sec. 6.  26 MRSA §1232, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 312, §5, is amended 
2to read:
32.  Failure to file or pay taxes; determination to prevent renewal, reissuance or 
4other extension of license or certificate.  If the commissioner determines that an 
5employer who holds a state-issued license or certificate of authority to conduct a 
6profession, trade or business has failed to file a return at the time required under this 
7chapter or has failed to pay a tax liability due under this chapter that has been demanded, 
8and the employer continues to fail to file or pay after at least 2 specific written requests to 
9do so, the commissioner shall notify the employer in writing by certified mail, return

11liability may result in loss of license or certificate of authority.
12This written notice must include information about the opportunity to request a fact-
13finding interview for the purpose of determining essential facts, negotiating a payment 
14agreement and determining the appropriateness of further enforcement under this section.
15If the employer requests a fact-finding interview within 30 days, the commissioner shall 
16schedule the interview at which the commissioner shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable 
17payment agreement.  The employer must be notified in writing if the commissioner's 
18determination is to prevent renewal, reissuance or extension of the license or certificate of 
19authority by the issuing agency.  If the employer enters into a payment agreement, a 
20determination may not be made under this section until the employer fails to comply with 
21the agreement.
22If the employer continues, for a period in excess of 30 days from notice of possible denial 
23of renewal or reissuance of a license or certificate of authority, to fail to file or show

27agency.
28A review of the determination is available by filing an appeal under section 1226 to the 
29Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission Division of Administrative Hearings.  
30Either by failure to proceed to the next step of appeal or by exhaustion of the steps of 
31appeal, the determination of the commissioner's right to prevent renewal or reissuance 
32becomes final unless otherwise determined by appeal.
33In any event, the license or certificate of authority in question remains in effect until all 
34appeals are taken to their final conclusion.  This subsection may not be invoked for any 
35tax liability under appeal.
36Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
37legislation takes effect when approved.
38SUMMARY
39This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing unemployment 
40compensation.
Page 5 - 129LR3028(01)-111.  Current law provides that, beginning January 1, 2022, benefits paid to an 
2individual under the laws governing unemployment compensation must be charged 
3against the experience rating record of the claimant's employers in a ratio inversely 
4proportional to the claimant's employment beginning with the most recent employer.  
5This bill strikes that language and instead restores the previous language governing the 
6employer benefit charging model.
72.  It provides that the experience rating record of the most recent subject employer 
8may not be charged with benefits paid to a claimant whose work record with that 
9employer totals 5 or fewer consecutive weeks.
103.  It provides that, in the absence of an application for redetermination filed within 
1130 days after the mailing of notification of benefits paid and chargeable to the employer's 
12experience rating, the notification is conclusive and binding.  Under the bill, any request 
13for reconsideration must be made under the laws governing appeals of determination or 
14assessment.
154.  It replaces references to the Unemployment Insurance Commission with 
16references to the Division of Administrative Hearings to conform with changes made in 
17Public Law 2017, chapter 284, Part AAAAA.
