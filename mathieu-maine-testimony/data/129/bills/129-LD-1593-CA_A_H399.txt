129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "h" to H.P. 1152, L.D. 1593, Bill, "An Act To 
Support Infrastructure Improvements in Schools" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §15915, sub-§1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 
279, § 1, is amended to read: 
1. Initial agreement for energy conservation improvements. A school 
administrative unit may enter into an agreement of up to 20 years with an energy services 
company. For the purposes of this section, "energy services company" means a company 
or 3rd-party financing company that provides design, installation, operation, maintenance 
and financing of locally funded energy conservation improvements, air quality 
improvements or combined energy conservation and related air quality improvements at 
existing school administrative unit facilities. The school administrative unit's costs to 
enter into such an agreement are not applicable to the unit's school construction project 
costs, the debt service on which is eligible for subsidy purposes under section 15907. 
Such an agreement is deemed to be a professional service, which is not subject to the 
competitive bidding requirements of Title 5, section 1743-A, if the agreement: 
A. Provides for operation or maintenance of the improvement for at least 5 years or 
the entire term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years; 
B. Requires a guaranty by the contractor that the improvement will meet 
performance criteria set forth in the agreement for at least 5 years or for the entire 
term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years; and 
C. Has a total contract cost, excluding private or federal grant funds, interest and 
operating and maintenance costs, of less than $2,500,000 $10,000,000 for any school 
building or project. 
A school administrative unit may select an energy services company on the basis of a 
request for qualifications or a request for proposals, and it is not required to use a 
competitive method set forth in this chapter and Title 5, section 1743-A and Private and

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A" to H.P. 1152, L.D. 1593 
1 Special Law 1999, chapter 79. The selection process must include at a minimum a 
2 request for qualifications or a request for proposals that is advertised in a newspaper of 
3 general circulation in the school administrative unit and a newspaper of general 
4 circulation in the City of Augusta. The deadline for receipt of requests for qualifications 
5 or requests for proposals may not be less than 15 days from the last day the advertisement 
6 was published. The school administrative unit shall establish an interview committee, 
7 which must include the superintendent of the school administrative unit and at least one 
8 school board member. The interview committee shall interview not fewer than 3 energy 
9 services companies unless a smaller number of energy services companies responds to the 
10 request for qualifications or request for proposals. A request for qualifications or a 
11 request for proposals may not contain terms that require an energy services company to 
12 have more than 3 years of experience in the energy conservation field, a minimum 
13 number of prior projects or project references or membership in or accreditation from a 
14 regional, national or international association of energy services companies or to use 
15 equipment that is not generally available to energy services companies or terms that are 
16 otherwise included for the purpose of bias or favoritism toward a particular energy 
17 services company. 
18 Objections to the terms of a request for qualifications or a request for proposals under this 
19 subsection are deemed waived if not delivered in writing to the office of the 
20 superintendent of schools in that school administrative unit within 7 days of the last 
21 publication of the newspaper advertisement. If an objection is received, the school board 
22 shall conduct a hearing on the objection within 14 days of its receipt. The school board 
23 shall allow interested energy services companies to speak at the hearing and shall issue a 
24 decision to either validate or invalidate the request for qualifications or the request for 
25 proposals within 7 days of the close of the hearing. A decision by the school board in 
26 response to an objection is a final government action subject to appeal to the Superior 
27 Court.' 
28 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
29 section number to read consecutively. 
30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment amends the definition of "energy services company" to mean a 
32 company or 3rd-party financing company that provides design, installation, operation, 
33 maintenance and financing of locally funded energy conservation improvements, air 
34 quality improvements or combined energy conservation and related air quality 
35 improvements at existing school administrative unit facilities. This amendment also 
36 increases the cap on the total contract cost, excluding private or federal grant funds, 
37 interest and operating and maintenance costs, for which an agreement is deemed to be a 
38 professional service, which is not subject to competitive bidding requirements, to 
39 $10,000,000.
