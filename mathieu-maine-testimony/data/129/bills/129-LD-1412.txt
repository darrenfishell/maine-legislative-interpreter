23Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §3808 is enacted to read:
24§3808.  Collective bargaining in school management and leadership centers
251.  Assumption of obligations, duties, liabilities and rights.  On and after the 
26operational date of a school management and leadership center, teachers and other 
27employees whose positions are transferred from a school administrative unit to the school 
28management and leadership center and were included in a bargaining unit represented by 
29a bargaining agent, and for participating school administrative units, teachers and other 
30employees who are subsequently employed by the school management and leadership 
31center and were included in a bargaining unit and represented by a bargaining agent, 
32continue to be included in the same bargaining unit and represented by the same 
33bargaining agent pending completion of the bargaining agent and bargaining unit merger 
34procedures and bargaining for initial school management and leadership center collective 
35bargaining agreements covering school management and leadership center employees, as 
36described in this section.  After teachers and other employees become employees of the 
37school management and leadership center, the school management and leadership center 
38has the obligations, duties, liabilities and rights of a public employer pursuant to Title 26, 
39chapter 9-A with respect to those teachers and other employees.
402.  Structure of bargaining units.  All bargaining units of school management and 
41leadership center employees must be structured on a school management and leadership 
42center-wide basis.  Teachers and other employees who are employed by the school 
Page 3 - 129LR1014(01)-11management and leadership center to provide consolidated services must be removed 
2from the existing bargaining units of teachers and other employees who are employed by 
3each member school unit and merged into units of school management and leadership 
4center employees.  Merger into school management and leadership center-wide 
5bargaining units is not subject to approval or disapproval of employees.  Formation of 
6school management and leadership center-wide bargaining units must occur in 
7accordance with this subsection.
8A.  In each school management and leadership center, there must be one bargaining 
9unit of teachers, if any teachers are employed by the school management and 
10leadership center, and, to the extent they are on the effective date of this paragraph 
11included in bargaining units, other certified professional employees, excluding 
12principals and other administrators.
13B.  Any additional bargaining units in a school management and leadership center 
14must be structured as follows.
15(1)  In the initial establishment of such units, units must be structured primarily 
16on the basis of the existing pattern of organization, maintaining the grouping of 
17employee classifications into bargaining units that existed prior to the creation of 
18the school management and leadership center and avoiding conflicts among 
19different bargaining agents to the extent possible.
20(2)  In the event of a dispute regarding the classifications to be included within a 
21school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit, the current 
22bargaining agent or agents or the school management and leadership center may 
23petition the Maine Labor Relations Board to determine the appropriate unit in 
24accordance with this section and Title 26, section 966.
25C.  When there is the same bargaining agent in all bargaining units that will be 
26merged into a school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit, the 
27units must be separated and merged on the operational date or the date represented 
28employees are transferred to the school management and leadership center, 
29whichever is applicable, and the school management and leadership center shall 
30recognize the bargaining agent as the representative of the merged unit.
31D.  When all bargaining units that will be separated and merged into a school 
32management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit are represented by separate 
33local affiliates of the same state labor organization, the units must be separated and 
34merged on the operational date or the date represented employees are transferred to 
35the school management and leadership center, whichever is applicable.  The identity 
36of a single affiliate that will be designated the bargaining agent for the merged unit 
37must be selected by the existing bargaining agents and the state labor organization.  
38Upon completion of the merger and designation of the bargaining agent and 
39notification by the state labor organization to the school management and leadership 
40center, the school management and leadership center shall recognize the designated 
41bargaining agent as the representative of employees in the merged unit.  If necessary, 
42the parties shall then execute a written amendment to any collective bargaining 
43agreement then in effect to change the name of the bargaining agent to reflect the 
44merger.
Page 4 - 129LR1014(01)-11E.  When there are bargaining units that will be separated and merged into a school 
2management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit in which there are 
3employees who are not represented by any bargaining agent and other employees 
4who are represented either by the same bargaining agent or separate local affiliates of 
5the same state labor organization, the units must be separated and merged on the 
6operational date or the date represented employees are transferred to the school 
7management and leadership center, whichever is applicable, as long as a majority of 
8employees who compose the merged unit were represented by the bargaining agent 
9prior to the merger.  The procedures for separation and merger of separate local 
10affiliates of the same state labor organization described in paragraph D must be 
11followed if applicable.  If prior to the merger a bargaining agent did not represent a 
12majority of employees who compose the merged unit, a bargaining agent election 
13must be conducted by the Maine Labor Relations Board pursuant to paragraph F.
14F.  When bargaining units with different bargaining agents must be merged into a 
15single school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit pursuant to this 
16section, the bargaining agent of the merged bargaining unit must be selected in 
17accordance with Title 26, section 967 except as modified in this section.
18(1)  A petition for an election to determine the bargaining agent must be filed 
19with the Maine Labor Relations Board by any of the current bargaining agents or 
20the school management and leadership center.
21(2)  The petition must be filed not more than 90 days prior to the first August 31st 
22occurring after either the 3rd anniversary date of the operational date of the 
23school management and leadership center or the date on which positions are 
24transferred from member school units to the school management and leadership 
25center, whichever is later.
26(3)  The election ballot may contain only the names of the bargaining agents of 
27bargaining units that will be merged into the school management and leadership 
28center-wide bargaining unit and the choice of no representative, but no other 
29choices.  A showing of interest is not required from any such bargaining agent 
30other than its current status as representative.
31(4)  The obligation to bargain with existing bargaining agents continues from the 
32operational date of the school management and leadership center or the date on 
33which positions are transferred from member school units to the school 
34management and leadership center, whichever is later, until the determination of 
35the bargaining agent of the school management and leadership center-wide 
36bargaining unit under this section; but in no event may any collective bargaining 
37agreement that is executed after the operational date extend beyond the first 
38August 31st occurring after either the 3rd anniversary date of the operational date 
39of the school management and leadership center or the date on which positions 
40are transferred from member school units to the school management and 
41leadership center, whichever is later.
42(5)  The Maine Labor Relations Board shall expedite to the extent practicable all 
43petitions for determination of the bargaining agent in the school management and 
44leadership center filed pursuant to this section.
Page 5 - 129LR1014(01)-11(6)  The bargaining units must be merged into a school management and 
2leadership center-wide bargaining unit as of the date of certification of the results 
3of the election by the Maine Labor Relations Board or the expiration of the 
4collective bargaining agreements in the unit, whichever occurs later.
5(7)  Until the first August 31st occurring after either the 3rd anniversary date of 
6the operational date of the school management and leadership center or the date 
7on which positions are transferred from member school units to the school 
8management and leadership center, whichever is later, existing bargaining agents 
9shall continue to represent the bargaining units that they represented on the day 
10prior to the operational date of the school management and leadership center.  If 
11necessary, each bargaining agent and the school management and leadership 
12center must negotiate interim collective bargaining agreements to expire the first 
13August 31st occurring after either the 3rd anniversary date of the operational date 
14of the school management and leadership center or the date on which positions 
15are transferred from member school units to the school management and 
16leadership center, whichever is later.
17(8)  When there are 2 or more bargaining units in which there are employees who 
18are represented either by the same bargaining agent or by separate local affiliates 
19of the same state labor organization that will be merged into a school 
20management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit with one or more other 
21bargaining units pursuant to the election procedures described in this paragraph, 
22the bargaining units that are represented either by the same bargaining agent or 
23by separate local affiliates of the same state labor organization must merge as of 
24the operational date.  The procedures for merger of separate local affiliates of the 
25same state labor organization described in paragraph D must be followed if 
26applicable.
273.  Agent to engage in collective bargaining.  After the merger of bargaining units 
28in a school management and leadership center, the bargaining agent of a school 
29management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit and the school management and 
30leadership center shall engage in collective bargaining for a collective bargaining 
31agreement for the school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit.  In the 
32collective bargaining agreement for each school management and leadership center-wide 
33bargaining unit, the employment relations, policies, practices, salary schedules, hours and 
34working conditions throughout the school management and leadership center must be 
35made uniform and consistent as soon as practicable.  In the event that the parties are 
36unable to agree upon an initial school management and leadership center-wide collective 
37bargaining agreement, the parties shall use the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to 
38Title 26, section 965 to resolve their differences.
394.  Application of collective bargaining agreements.  On and after the operational 
40date of a school management and leadership center, but before the completion of 
41negotiations for a single school management and leadership center-wide collective 
42bargaining agreement for the school management and leadership center-wide bargaining 
43unit, the wages, hours and working conditions of an employee of the school management 
44and leadership center who is in a bargaining unit and who is reassigned to a different 
45position that is in a different bargaining unit but that upon the completion of the merger 
Page 6 - 129LR1014(01)-11of bargaining units will be included in the same school management and leadership 
2center-wide bargaining unit must be determined by the terms of the collective bargaining 
3agreement that applies to the position to which the employee is reassigned, except as 
4provided in this subsection.
5A.  If the application of the collective bargaining agreement that applies to the 
6position to which the employee is reassigned would cause a reduction in the 
7employee's wage or salary rate, the employee's wage or salary rate must be 
8maintained at the rate the employee was paid immediately prior to the reassignment 
9until the completion of negotiations for a single school management and leadership 
10center-wide collective bargaining agreement for the school management and 
11leadership center-wide bargaining unit or the applicable collective bargaining 
12agreement requires a higher wage or salary rate for the employee, whichever occurs 
13sooner.
14B.  If the application of the existing collective bargaining agreement that applies to 
15the position to which the employee is reassigned would cause a reduction in the 
16amount that is paid by the school management and leadership center for premiums for 
17health insurance for the employee and the employee's dependents, the school 
18management and leadership center's payment must be maintained at the amount that 
19was paid immediately prior to the reassignment until the completion of negotiations 
20for a single school management and leadership center-wide collective bargaining 
21agreement for the school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit or 
22the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires a higher payment, whichever 
23occurs sooner.
24C.  If the application of the existing collective bargaining agreement that applies to 
25the position to which the employee is reassigned provides for coverage under a 
26different health insurance plan, the employee may elect to retain coverage under the 
27health insurance plan in which the employee was enrolled immediately prior to 
28reassignment if the eligibility provisions of the plan permit until the completion of 
29negotiations for a single school management and leadership center-wide collective 
30bargaining agreement for the school management and leadership center-wide 
31bargaining unit.
32SUMMARY

34established under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, chapter 123 are eligible to
