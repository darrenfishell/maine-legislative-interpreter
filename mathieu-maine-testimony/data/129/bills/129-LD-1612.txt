Page 1 - 129LR1329(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  33 MRSA §1953, sub-§1, ¶G, as corrected by RR 2011, c. 1, §48, is 
3amended to read:
4G.  A gift obligation or stored-value card, 2 years after December 31st of the year in 
5which the obligation or the most recent transaction involving the obligation or stored-
6value card occurred, whichever is later, including the initial issuance and any 
7subsequent addition of value to the obligation or stored-value card.
8(1)  The amount unclaimed is 60% of the gift obligation's or stored-value card's 
9face value.
10(2)  A gift obligation or stored-value card sold on or after December 31, 2011 is 
11not presumed abandoned if the gift obligation or stored-value card was sold by a 
12single issuer who in the past calendar year sold no more than $250,000 in face 
13value of gift obligations or stored-value cards.  Sales of gift obligations and 
14stored-value cards are considered sales by a single issuer if the sales were by 
15businesses that operate either:
16(a) Under common ownership or control with another business or businesses 
17in the State; or
18(b)  As franchised outlets of a parent business.
19(3)  A period of limitation may not be imposed on the owner's right to redeem the 
20a gift obligation or stored-value card.
21(4)  Notwithstanding section 1956, fees or charges may not be imposed on gift 
22obligations or stored-value cards, except that the issuer may charge a transaction 
23fee for the initial issuance and for each occurrence of adding value to an existing 
24gift obligation or stored-value card.  These transaction fees must be disclosed in a 
25separate writing prior to the initial issuance or referenced on the gift obligation or 
26stored-value card.
27(5)  Beginning November 1, 2008, if the gift obligation or stored-value card is 
28redeemed in person and a balance of less than $5 remains following redemption, 
29at the consumer's request the merchant redeeming the gift obligation or 
30stored-value card must refund the balance in cash to the consumer.  This 
31subparagraph does not apply to a prepaid telephone service card, a gift obligation 
32or nonreloadable stored-value card with an initial value of $5 or less or a stored-
33value card that is not purchased but provided as a promotion or as a refund for 
34merchandise returned without a receipt.
35(6)  This paragraph does not apply to prefunded bank cards;.
36(7)  A gift obligation card may not be presumed to be abandoned;
37SUMMARY
38Under current law, a gift obligation card, which includes a gift certificate, gift card 
39and online gift account, is considered abandoned 2 years after the expiration of the 
Page 2 - 129LR1329(01)-11calendar year in which it was purchased or last used.  This bill removes the presumption 
2of abandonment for gift obligation cards.
