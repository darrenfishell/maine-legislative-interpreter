Page 5 - 129LR1109(01)-11SUMMARY
2The federal Agricultural Act of 2014, also known as the 2014 Farm Bill, legalized the 
3growth and cultivation of hemp in states that choose to establish agricultural pilot 
4programs for research purposes. 
5This bill requires the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
6establish, by rule, the Maine Hemp Pilot Program, including the application process, 
7licensing fees and reporting requirements, consistent with the 2014 Farm Bill.  Under the 
8pilot program, a licensee may plant, grow, harvest, possess, process, sell and buy hemp as 
9long as the purpose of the program is to study the growth, cultivation or marketing of 
10hemp.  An institution of higher education is also authorized to establish a pilot program 
11that complies with the 2014 Farm Bill as long as it provides notice of its intention to the 
12Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and local law enforcement and an 
13annual report to the department regarding its research.
14This bill also expressly authorizes marijuana manufacturing facilities and testing 
15facilities licensed under the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act and the Marijuana 
16Legalization Act to obtain a license to process and test hemp and hemp-derived products 
17that are legal under state and federal law.
18Finally, this bill amends the recently enacted law that provides that food, food 
19additives and food products containing hemp-derived cannabidiol are not considered to 
20be "adulterated" under state law to require the Department of Health and Human Services 
21and the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to adopt routine technical 
22rules regarding testing, labeling, packaging and record-keeping requirements for food, 
23food additives or food products that contain hemp, including cannabidiol derived from 
24hemp, and to also provisionally adopt emergency major substantive rules doing the same.
