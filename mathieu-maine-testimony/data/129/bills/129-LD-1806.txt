7(b)  Has graduated from high school; and 
8(c)  Enrolled in a degree program and was awarded benefits under this 
9subsection prior to the child's 22nd birthday.  If the child is unable to enroll 
10in a degree program prior to turning 22 years of age due to service in the 
11United States Armed Forces, then the child may apply to begin this benefit 
12until reaching 26 years of age.  Other requirements must be met as described 
13in paragraph F.
14"Child" includes a stepchild whose parent is married to an eligible veteran for at 
15least 5 years and remains married to the veteran during the period for which 
16benefits are received.
17The director may waive the requirements of this subparagraph when the director 
18determines that there are special and extenuating circumstances that may have a 
19negative effect on a dependent.
20(2)  "Spouse" means the person currently legally married to a living veteran or 
21the unremarried widow or widower of a deceased veteran, not previously 
22divorced from that veteran.
23Awards under the educational benefits program are authorized to provide benefits

25(3)  "Veteran" means any person who served in the military or naval forces of the 
26United States and entered the service from this State or has been a resident of this 
27State for 5 years immediately preceding application for aid and, if living,

4Sec. 5.  37-B MRSA §505, sub-§2, ¶F, as amended by PL 2013, c. 569, §3, is 
5further amended to read:
6F.  A child of a veteran who is attending state-supported postsecondary vocational 
7schools or institutions of collegiate grade must be admitted free of tuition including 
8mandatory fees and lab fees for a certificate program, associate and bachelor's 
9programs and master's degree programs.  The tuition waiver provided under this 
10paragraph may be reduced by an amount necessary to ensure that the value of this 
11waiver, combined with all other grants and benefits received by the student, does not 
12exceed the total cost of education.  Room and board may not be waived.  A child of a 
13veteran has 6 10 academic years from the date of first entrance to complete 120 credit 
14hours.  For degree programs that require more than 120 credit hours, the state-
15supported postsecondary vocational school or institution of collegiate grade may 
16grant a tuition waiver beyond 120 credit hours.  If such a waiver is granted, the state-
17supported postsecondary vocational school or institution of collegiate grade shall 
18notify the director.  The director may waive the limit of 6 10 consecutive academic 
19years when the recipient's education has been interrupted by severe medical 
20disability, learning disability, illness or other hardship, making continued attendance 
21impossible, however, the extension may not exceed 2 academic years.  Students must 
22maintain at least a 2.0 or "C" grade point average to continue receiving educational 
23benefits. If a student's grade point average falls below 2.0 or a "C," then the student 
24has one semester to bring the grade point average up to at least 2.0 or a "C." If after 
25that semester the student's grade point average is below 2.0 or a "C," the student loses 
26educational benefits under this paragraph until the student achieves a grade point 
27average of at least 2.0 or a "C."
28Sec. 6.  Maine Revised Statutes amended; revision clause.    Wherever in the 
29Maine Revised Statutes the words "bureau of Maine veterans' services" appear or 
30reference is made to that entity or those words, those words are amended to read or mean, 
31as appropriate, "Maine bureau of veterans' services" or "bureau" and the Revisor of 
32Statutes shall implement this revision when updating, publishing or republishing the 
33statutes.
34SUMMARY

38Maine Veterans' Memorial Cemetery System and adds provisions regarding requirements 
39for burial in green burial sections.  The bill allows the Director of the Maine Bureau of 
40Veterans' Services to waive certain requirements in the laws governing educational 
41benefits for children of veterans, expands the type of programs covered by educational 
42benefits to include certificate programs and master's degree programs, allows a student 10 
43academic years to complete a program and removes the restriction on extending that time.
