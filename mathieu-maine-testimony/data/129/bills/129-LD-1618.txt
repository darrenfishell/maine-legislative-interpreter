Page 1 - 129LR2481(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §15915, sub-§1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 
3279, §1, is amended to read:
41.  Initial agreement for energy conservation improvements.  A school 
5administrative unit may enter into an agreement of up to 20 years with an energy services 
6company.  For the purposes of this section, "energy services company" means a company 
7or 3rd-party financing company that provides design, installation, operation, maintenance 
8and financing of energy conservation or combined energy conservation and related air 
9quality improvements at existing school administrative unit facilities.  The school 
10administrative unit's costs to enter into such an agreement are not applicable to the unit's 
11school construction project costs, the debt service on which is eligible for subsidy 
12purposes under section 15907.  Such an agreement is deemed to be a professional service, 
13which is not subject to the competitive bidding requirements of Title 5, section 1743-A, if 
14the agreement:
15A.  Provides for operation or maintenance of the improvement for at least 5 years or 
16the entire term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years;
17B.  Requires a guaranty by the contractor that the improvement will meet 
18performance criteria set forth in the agreement for at least 5 years or for the entire 
19term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years; and
20C.  Has a total contract cost, excluding private or federal grant funds, interest and 
21operating and maintenance costs, of less than $2,500,000 for any school building.
22A school administrative unit may select an energy services company on the basis of a 
23request for qualifications or a request for proposals, and it is not required to use a 
24competitive method set forth in this chapter and Title 5, section 1743-A and Private and 
25Special Law 1999, chapter 79.  The selection process must include at a minimum a 
26request for qualifications or a request for proposals that is advertised in a newspaper of 
27general circulation in the school administrative unit and a newspaper of general 
28circulation in the City of Augusta.  The deadline for receipt of requests for qualifications 
29or requests for proposals may not be less than 15 days from the last day the advertisement 
30was published. The school administrative unit shall establish an interview committee, 
31which must include the superintendent of the school administrative unit and at least one 
32school board member.  The interview committee shall interview not fewer than 3 energy 
33services companies unless a smaller number of energy services companies responds to the 
34request for qualifications or request for proposals.  A request for qualifications or a 
35request for proposals may not contain terms that require an energy services company to 
36have more than 3 years of experience in the energy conservation field, a minimum 
37number of prior projects or project references or membership in or accreditation from a 
38regional, national or international association of energy services companies or to use 
39equipment that is not generally available to energy services companies or terms that are 
40otherwise included for the purpose of bias or favoritism toward a particular energy 
41services company.
42Objections to the terms of a request for qualifications or a request for proposals under this 
43subsection are deemed waived if not delivered in writing to the office of the 
Page 2 - 129LR2481(01)-11superintendent of schools in that school administrative unit within 7 days of the last 
2publication of the newspaper advertisement. If an objection is received, the school board 
3shall conduct a hearing on the objection within 14 days of its receipt.  The school board 
4shall allow interested energy services companies to speak at the hearing and shall issue a 
5decision to either validate or invalidate the request for qualifications or the request for 
6proposals within 7 days of the close of the hearing.  A decision by the school board in 
7response to an objection is a final government action subject to appeal to the Superior 
8Court.
9Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §15915, sub-§1-B is enacted to read:
101-B.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
11following terms have the following meanings:
12A.  "Energy services company" means a company or 3rd-party financing company 
13that provides design, installation, operation, maintenance and financing of energy 
14conservation or combined energy conservation and related air quality improvements 
15at existing school administrative unit facilities.
16B.  "School administrative unit" or "unit" includes a career and technical education 
17region under chapter 313, subchapter 4.
18C.  "School board" or "board" includes a cooperative board of a career and technical 
19education region under section 8452.
20D.  "Superintendent" includes a career and technical education director of a career 
21and technical education region under section 8458.
22SUMMARY
23This bill adds the authority to enter into an agreement for energy conservation 
24improvements with an energy services company to the powers and duties of a cooperative 
25board of a career and technical education region, similar to the authority of a school 
26administrative unit.
