Fiscal Detail and NotesFiscal Note
This bill corrects the unintended result of statutory and rule changes made in 2017 and 2018 by the Department of 
Education regarding certification requirements for Education Technician I positions that made the people filling these 
positions mandatory members of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System (MainePERS) and ineligible for Social Security.  Prior to the changes, these employees generally participated in Social Security.  Because the 
employer contribution for these employees, whether they partic ipate in either Social Security or MainePERS, are paid 
by local school administrative units, this bill does not result in a fiscal impact to the State.   The employer contribution 
rate for participation in Social Security is 6.2% of wa ges. For the 2020-2021 biennium, th e employer contribution rate 
for participation in the State Employee and Teacher Re tirement Plan within MainePERS is 4.16% of wages.129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
