16 SUMMARY 
17 To ensure proper application of the sustenance fishing designated use proposed in the 
18 bill, this amendment amends the bill by updating the classifications for certain waters 
19 based on water quality data and by clarifying the description of certain water body 
20 segments. 
21 This bill as amended creates a sustenance fishing designated use as a subcategory of 
22 the applicable fishing designated use for certain specified water body segments within 
23 Maine's water classification program where there is or may be sustenance fishing or 
24 increased fish consumption by members of the Indian tribes in Maine or other Maine 
25 citizens. This bill as amended also requires that the Department of Environmental 
26 Protection adopt routine technical rnles no later than March 1, 2020 that calculate and 
27 establish water quality criteria protective of human health for toxic pollutants and the 
28 sustenance fishing designated use as established by this bill. This bill as amended limits 
29 the scope of the sustenance fishing designated use created by this bill by providing that, 
30 for all purposes, including for the purposes of the State's water classification program, 
31 the federal Clean Water Act and related rnles, regulations and guidance, the sustenance 
32 fishing designated use created by this bill as amended is deemed protected through water 
33 quality criteria for human health calculated and established 'for the identified water body 
34 segments using, in addition to the other assumptions used in developing human health 
35 criteria generally under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 420, subsection 2 
36 and rnles adopted by the department, a fish consumption rate of 200 grams per day and a 
37 cancer risk level of one in 1,000,000, except for inorganic arsenic, the risk level for which 
38 is governed by Title 38, section 420, subsection 2, paragraph J. The designation in this 
39 bill as amended of specific waters subject to a sustenance fishing designated use is not

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A "to H.P. 1262, L.D. 1775 
1 intended to preclude a future designation of other such waters through a similar 
2 legislative process or as otherwise provided by law. 
3 All aspects of this bill as amended, including the sustenance fishing designated use 
4 and the identification of specific water body segments subject to that use, are intended to 
5 have meaning and effect within the State's water classification program only and for 
6 purposes of calculating and establishing water quality criteria for human health sufficient 
7 to protect the sustenance fishing designated use only. Nothing in this bill as amended or 
8 the sustenance fishing designated use it establishes is intended to apply to or affect 
9 discharges of mercury, which are governed exclusively by separate provisions of law, 
10 including Title 38, section 420, subsection 1-B and section 413, subsection 11. This bill 
11 as amended changes the human health ambient criterion specified in Title 38, section 420, 
12 subsection 1-B, paragraph A, subparagraph (2) to reflect the 200 grams per day fish 
13 consumption rate that the Department of Environmental Protection is directed to use 
14 when deriving human health criteria for toxic pollutants to protect the sustenance fishing 
15 designated use; however, this change is not intended to affect the mercury discharge 
16 limits set forth in Title 38, section 420, subsection 1-B and section 413, subsection 11. 
17 Nothing in this bill as amended is intended to alter or affect in any way any provision of 
18 any of the State's state and federal Indian settlement acts, including the state Indian 
19 settlement acts in Title 30, chapters 601 and 603. No part of this bill as amended is 
20 intended to relate to or affect in any way any claims or disputes regarding any definition 
21 of Indian country, territory, lands, waters, reservations or rights of any kind under any 
22 other provision of state or federal law. No part of this bill as amended is intended to 
23 create or limit any right or protection under any other state or federal law, including the 
24 federal Clean Water Act, except as described in this summary, or any state or federal 
25 Indian settlement law or act, or create in any way a right to any particular quantity or 
26 quality of fish. The sole intent of this bill as amended is to establish a sustenance fishing 
27 designated use that is deemed protected for all purposes through water quality criteria for 
28 human health calculated and established through routine technical rulemaldng using a 
29 specific minimum fish consumption rate and specified cancer risk levels for the waters 
30 expressly identified in the State's water classification program, which criteria are 
31 applicable for the purposes of the State's water classification program and the federal 
32 Clean Water Act.
