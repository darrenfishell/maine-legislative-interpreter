distributed resources only to the extent the aggregate projected costs of all contracts 
entered into does not exceed the commission's best estimate of the aggregate costs of 
l~mg-term contracts for 375 megawatts of distributed resources if the capacity of each 
resource were limited to no more than 5 megawatts of capacity.

amendment, the Public utilities Commission would be required to conduct at least two solicitations for long-tenn 
contracts to acquire distributed energy resources and must do that without exceeding the aggregate cost of the 
procurement process it replaces. Additional staff would no longer be needed and the allocations in the committee 
amendment for staff and contracted consultants are reversed.
