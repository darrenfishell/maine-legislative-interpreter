14investor-owned transmission and distribution utility; and
15D.  Transmission capacity, capacity resources, energy or renewable energy credits 
16pursuant to a regional procurement process in conjunction with other states.
17The commission may permit, but may not require, investor-owned transmission and 
18distribution utilities to enter into contracts for differences that are designed and intended 
19to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 
20development.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 
21for long-term contracts for investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities under 
22this subsection having the same legal and financial effect as the procedures used for 
23standard-offer service pursuant to section 3212 for investor-owned transmission and 
24distribution utilities.
25The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible, demand response or energy 
26efficiency capacity resources.  These contracts are not subject to the rules of the State 
27Purchasing Agent.  In a competitive solicitation conducted pursuant to subsection 6, the 
28commission shall allow transmission and distribution utilities to submit bids for 
29interruptible or demand response capacity resources.
30Capacity resources contracted under this subsection may not exceed the amount 
31necessary to ensure the reliability of the electric grid of this State, to meet the energy 
32efficiency program budget allocations articulated in the triennial plan as approved by the 
33commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4 or any annual update plan approved 
34by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 6 or to lower customer costs as 
35determined by the commission pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 10.
36Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a capacity 
37resource may not be contracted under this subsection unless the commission determines 
38that the capacity resource is recognized as a capacity resource for purposes of any 
39regional or federal capacity requirements.
40The commission shall ensure that any long-term contract authorized under this subsection 
41is consistent with the State's goals for greenhouse gas reduction levels under Title 38, 
42section 576 576-A and the regional greenhouse gas initiative as described in the state 
43climate action plan required in Title 38, section 577 579.

20§2, is further amended to read:
21A.  Wind energy is an economically feasible, large-scale energy resource that does 
22not rely on fossil fuel combustion or nuclear fission, thereby displacing electrical 
23energy provided by these other sources and avoiding air pollution, waste disposal 
24problems and hazards to human health from emissions, waste and by-products; 
25consequently, wind energy development may address energy needs while making a 
26significant contribution to achievement of the State's renewable energy and 
27greenhouse gas reduction objectives, including those in Title 38, section 576 576-A; 
28Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§4, ¶F, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, 
29c. 369, Pt. A, §13, is amended to read:
30F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 
31energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 
32consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 
33and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 
34funding necessary to meet those goals:
35(1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;
36(2) Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 
37to participate in and share the costs of cost-effective home weatherization to a 
38minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;
39(3) Reducing peak-load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 
40megawatts by 2020;
41(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 
4220% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 
Page 5 - 129LR1562(01)-11pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 
2section 10120;
3(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 
4efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and
5(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 
6in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals reduction levels 
7established in Title 38, section 576 576-A.
8The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 
9emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 
10program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 
11may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 
12generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.
13Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 
14trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 
15as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 
16low-income weatherization programs.
17As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 
18#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 
19processes.
20Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §574, sub-§§1-A, 1-B and 1-C are enacted to read:
211-A.  Climate action plan.  "Climate action plan" means the state plan adopted in 
222004 by the department under this chapter to address greenhouse gas emissions 
23reductions in each sector in cost-effective ways.
241-B.  Gross annual greenhouse gas emissions. "Gross annual greenhouse gas 
25emissions" means the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted by all sources within the 
26State each year.
271-C.  Net annual greenhouse gas emissions.  "Net annual greenhouse gas 
28emissions" means gross annual greenhouse gas emissions less the total amount of 
29greenhouse gases absorbed each year by plants and natural ecosystems, including, but not 
30limited to, trees, crops, soil and wetlands within the State.
31Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §576, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 237, §1, is repealed.

341.  2050 annual emissions level.  By January 1, 2050, the State shall reduce net 
35annual greenhouse gas emissions to at least 80% below the 1990 net annual greenhouse 
36gas emissions level.
372.  Interim emissions levels.  The department shall adopt rules establishing interim 
38net annual greenhouse gas emissions levels for 2030 and 2040. The interim net annual 
Page 6 - 129LR1562(01)-11greenhouse gas emissions levels must maximize the State's ability to meet the 2050 net 
2annual greenhouse gas emissions level. The interim 2030 net annual greenhouse gas 
3emissions level must at a minimum be consistent with the highest level of the greenhouse 
4gas emissions reduction range adopted by the Conference of New England Governors and 
5Eastern Canadian Premiers in Resolution 39-1, dated August 31, 2015.  The interim 2040 
6net annual emissions level must at a minimum be sufficient to project achievement of the 
72050 net annual emissions level.  The department shall set the interim 2030 net annual 
8emissions level by January 1, 2020 and the interim 2040 net annual emissions level by 
9January 1, 2030.
103.  Monitoring and reporting rules.  By January 1, 2020, the department shall adopt 
11rules to monitor and report to the Legislature on gross and net annual greenhouse gas 
12emissions.  By January 1, 2021, and periodically thereafter, the department shall adopt 
13rules to ensure compliance with the levels established by and pursuant to subsections 1 
14and 2.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in

17following enacted in its place:
18§577.  Action plan; long-term goal
191.  Long-term reduction goal.  The State's long-term reduction goal is to reduce net 
20annual greenhouse gas emissions to an extent sufficient to minimize harmful effects of 
21climate change.  To accomplish this goal, reducing net annual greenhouse gas emissions 
22to zero by 2050 may be necessary.
232.  Climate action plan update.  By December 1, 2020, the department, with input 
24from stakeholders, shall update the State's climate action plan to meet the reduction levels 
25in section 576-A.  In updating the climate action plan, the department shall conduct a 
26study examining pathways to reduce net annual greenhouse gas emissions consistent with 
27the levels in section 576-A and with the long-term goal in subsection 1.  The department 
28shall quantitatively analyze and report on the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness 
29of each pathway.  To fund the analysis, the department may solicit and receive financial 
30support from the public and private and nonprofit organizations.  The department shall 
31submit the study to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
32over natural resources matters, which is authorized to report out legislation related to the 
33study.  In identifying the preferred pathways to include in the updated climate action plan, 
34the department shall give consideration to the following objectives:
35A.  Pursuing the most cost-effective and technologically feasible reduction pathways 
36while minimizing effects on low-income and moderate-income persons, minimizing 
37environmental effects, supporting economic sectors that face the biggest barriers to 
38emissions reductions and creating, when feasible, additional employment and 
39economic growth in the State;
40B.  Encouraging the use of natural solutions to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, 
41such as solutions related to forests, farms and coastal lands in the State and materials 
42that sequester carbon;
Page 7 - 129LR1562(01)-11C.  Ensuring that all sectors and regions of the State and the broadest group of 
2residents benefit from reaching the levels in section 576-A and the long-term goal in 
3subsection 1, with consideration to economic, quality-of-life and public health
