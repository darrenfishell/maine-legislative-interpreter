An Act To Provide for a Professional Wage and Support for New Educators 
Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment ''Ir' LS-5"1) 
Committee: Education and Cultural Affairs 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Future bie1mium cost increase -School Administrative Units 
This legislation requires local school administrative units (SAU's) to increase the minimum salary for certified 
teachers to $40,000 beginning in the 2020-2021 school year. The Department of Education has estimated the cost of 
this provision to be $10,000,000 for that school year. This amount does not include, and the bill does not address, any 
additional costs to SAU's to adjust salmy schedules for certified teachers whose salaries will be above the $40,000 
minimum in fiscal year 2020-21 when teachers whose salaries are below the $40,000 threshold will be increased to 
$40,000. The Governor's proposed budget for the 2020-2021 biennium, LD 1001, includes a General Fund 
appropriation of $10,000,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 for the cost of increasing the minimum salary for certified 
teachers to $40,000 per year. 
This bill requires the Department of Education to detennine the amount of state funds necessary to fund 100% of the 
increase in the minimum salary for teachers in fiscal year 2020-21, 66% of the increase in fiscal year 2021-22 and 
33% of the increase in fiscal year 2022-23 and rep01t those amounts to the Joint Standing Conunittee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs no later than December 15, 2019. The bill also provides that the committee shall rep01t out a bill 
to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature to provide the necessmy funding. Unless the required funding 
for fiscal year 2020-21 is approved and enacted by the 129th Legislature, either in the 2020-2021 biem1ial budget or 
other legislation, the full cost of this measure will be borne by SAU's. For any future fiscal year that the State does 
not fund the additional cost of this minimum salary requirement SAU's will be required to fund 100% of the cost. 
The increase in salmies as a result of this legislation will increase the employer contribution for the normal cost 
component of the Maine Public Employers Retirement System (MainePERS). That rate for teachers for fiscal year 
2020-21 is 4.16%. When this rate is applied to the projected increase in teacher salaries the additional amount SAU's 
will have to pay to MainePERS for the nonnal cost of teacher retirement is estimated to be $416,000 in fiscal year 
2020-21.
