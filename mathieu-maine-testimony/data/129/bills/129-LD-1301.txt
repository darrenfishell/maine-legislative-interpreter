2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง8006 is enacted to read:

41.  During investigation.  All complaints and investigative records of the 
5Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, referred to in this section as "the 
6department," related to violations of this Part are confidential during the pendency of an 
7investigation. Those records become public records upon the conclusion of an 
8investigation unless confidentiality is required by some other provision of law. For 
9purposes of this section, an investigation is concluded when:
10A.  A notice of an adjudicatory hearing under Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 5 has 
11been issued;
12B.  A consent agreement has been executed;
13C.  An enforcement proceeding has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction; or
14D.  The investigation has been closed.
152.  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding subsection 1, during the pendency of an 
16investigation, a complaint or investigative record may be disclosed:
17A.  To department employees designated by the Commissioner of Agriculture, 
18Conservation and Forestry;
19B.  By a department employee or complaint officer designated by the Commissioner 
20of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry when and to the extent considered 
21necessary to facilitate the investigation;
22C.  To other state or federal agencies when the files contain evidence of possible 
23violations of laws enforced by those agencies;
24D.  When and to the extent considered necessary by the Commissioner of 
25Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to avoid imminent and serious harm. The 
26authority of the commissioner to make such a disclosure may not be delegated;
27E.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the department, when it is determined that 
28confidentiality is no longer warranted due to general public knowledge of the 
29circumstances surrounding the complaint or investigation and when the investigation 
30would not be prejudiced by the disclosure; and
31F.  To the person investigated on that person's request. The Commissioner of 
32Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may refuse to disclose part or all of any 
33investigative information, including the fact of an investigation, when the 
34commissioner determines that disclosure would prejudice the investigation. The 
35authority of the commissioner to make such a determination may not be delegated.
363.  Attorney General records.  The provision or disclosure of investigative records 
37of the Department of the Attorney General to a department employee designated by the 
38Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry does not constitute a waiver of 
Page 2 - 129LR1424(01)-11the confidentiality of those records for any other purposes. Further disclosure of those 
2investigative records is subject to Title 16, section 804 and the discretion of the Attorney 
3General.
44.  Violation.  A person who knowingly or intentionally makes a disclosure in 
5violation of this section commits a civil violation for which a fine not to exceed $1,000 
6may be adjudged.
