FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AME~MENT "fl "to H.P. 685, L.D. 930, Bill, "An Act To Give 
Maine Schools Additional Options To Make Up Missed School Days" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 20~A l\1RSA §4801, sub-§1, ,rF, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 60, §1, is 
amended to read: 
-F. A school administrative unit operating under a plan approved- by the 
commissioner may provide for a one-hour extension of the school day for up to 25 
days in a school year. Notwithstanding the required number of school days under this 
subsection, 5 one-hour extensions may be counted as one additional school day. A 
school administrative unit may, with the approval of the commissioner pursuant to 
rules adopted in accordance with this subsection, implement extended days pursuant 
to this paragraph only for the purpose of making up school days missed due to 
weather or emergency closures. A school administrative unit may develop other 
ways to make up school days missed due to weather or emergency closures not 
included in this paragraph as long as they are incorporated into a plan approved by 
the commissioner.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the provisions in the bill that propose to add to the statutes 
provisions in Department of Education rules governing how school administrative units 
may make up school days missed due to weather or emergency closures, including 
rescheduling or shortening scheduled vacation periods, postponing the scheduled closing 
date of school and conducting classes during the weekend. The amendment also strikes 
the provision allowing school administrative units to make up school days by providing 
students with packets of homework the completion of which counts as completion of a 
regular day of school. The amendment leaves in place the provision allowing school 
administrative units to develop other ways to make up school days missed due to weather
