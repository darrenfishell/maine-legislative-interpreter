Fiscal Detail and Notes129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
The increase in the minimum wage for school support staff may also increase costs to the child nutrition programs, 
which are not included in the calculation of the total cost of public education for kindergarten to grade 12 and do not 
receive state subsidy from the General Purpose Aid for Lo cal Schools program.  Unless General Fund appropriations 
are provided, SAU's will be responsible for 100% of this cost, as well.Requiring a minimum hourly wage of $16 per hour for sc hool support staff will increase costs to local school 
administrative units (SAU's) beginning in fiscal year 2022-23.   This bill requires the State to fund 100% of that cost 
for fiscal year 2022-23 only.  No estimat e of the cost of this provision for 2022-23 and future years can be made until 
SAU's provide the required wage informati on to the department by October 1, 2021.This bill establishes a minimum hourly wage of $16 pe r hour for school support staff beginning with the 2022-2023 
school year.  The Department of Education will incur a one -time cost of $80,000 in fiscal year 2021-22 to the General 
Purpose Aid for Local Schools program to update its data coll ection system to allow for school administrative units to 
report hourly wage data for school support staff.  Once collect ed, this data will be incorporated into the essential 
programs and services (EPS) funding model that is used  to calculate the total cost of public education from 
kindergarten to grade 12.  This fiscal note assumes that th e department will include a request to fund this initiative as 
part of its 2022-2023 bie nnial budget proposal.An Act To Set a Minimum Wage for School Support Staff

Fiscal Note
After fiscal year 2022-23, SAU's will be responsible for f unding 100% of the cost of this initiative until the hourly 
wage data for these school personnel can be collected and incorporated into the EPS funding model.  For those 
components within the model that are expenditure driven, it w ill be 2 years before the salary increase will be reflected 
in the total cost of education as determined by the EPS funding model.  Other component s of the model that are not 
expenditure driven could be incorporated sooner, allowing for those costs to be reflected in the total cost of education 
for fiscal year 2022-23.  Given this information, the in crease in the State's contri bution for funding K-12 public 
education as a result of this legislation will not occur until the 2022-2023 biennium. Future biennium cost increase - General Fund
Future biennium cost increase - local school administrative units
