Page 1 - 129LR0612(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2513, first ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 331, §12 and 
3affected by §§16 and 17, is further amended to read:
4Every Except as provided in section 2513-C, every insurance company or association 
5that does business or collects premiums or assessments including annuity considerations 
6in the State, including surety companies and companies engaged in the business of credit 
7insurance or title insurance, shall, for the privilege of doing business in this State and in 
8addition to any other taxes imposed for that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct 
9premiums including annuity considerations, whether in cash or otherwise, on contracts 
10written on risks located or resident in the State for insurance of life, annuity, fire, casualty 
11and other risks at the rate of 2% a year.  Every nonadmitted insurer that does business or 
12collects premiums in the State shall, for the privilege of doing business in this State and 
13in addition to any other taxes imposed for that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct 
14premiums, whether in cash or otherwise, as provided in section 2531.  For purposes of 
15this section chapter, the term "annuity considerations" includes amounts paid to an 
16insurance company for the purchase of a contract that may result in an annuity, even if 
17the annuitization never occurs or does not occur until some time in the future and the 
18amounts are in the meantime applied to an investment vehicle other than an annuity.  This 
19section does not apply to mutual fire insurance companies subject to tax under section 
202517 or to captive insurance companies formed or licensed under Title 24-A, chapter 83 
21or under the laws of another state.
22Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2513-C is enacted to read:
23§2513-C.  Tax on annuity considerations
241.  Phase-out of tax.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the rate of 
25tax under this chapter for annuity considerations is 1.5% in calendar year 2020, 1% in 
26calendar year 2021 and 0.5% in calendar year 2022.  Beginning in calendar year 2023, 
27annuity considerations are not subject to tax under this chapter, but taxes due for previous 
28years may be collected.
292.  Application of reduced rate on annuities.  The reduced rates specified in 
30subsection 1 for calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022 apply to premiums on an annuity 
31paid by annuity holders in this State only if the tax savings from the reduced rate are 
32credited to the annuity holders.  Upon request of the bureau, an insurer shall submit 
33evidence that establishes that the tax savings derived from the reduced rate under this 
34section have been credited to the annuity holders.
35Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §2515, as amended by PL 2013, c. 331, Pt. C, §11, is further 
36amended to read:
37§2515.  Amount of tax
38In determining the amount of tax due under sections 2513 and 2531, each company 
39shall deduct from the full amount of gross direct premiums the amount of all direct return 
40premiums on the gross direct premiums and all dividends paid to policyholders on direct 
Page 2 - 129LR0612(01)-11premiums, and the tax must be computed by those companies or their agents.  Except 
2when direct return premiums are returned in the same tax year that the premium was paid, 
3the deduction allowed in this section may be taken only if the tax under this Part has been 
4paid.  For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the deductions under this 
5section related to annuity considerations may be deducted only from annuity 
6considerations.
7SUMMARY
8This bill phases out the insurance premium tax on annuity considerations over 4 years 
9beginning in 2020.  During the phase-out period, the prescribed rate applies only if the 
10insurer credits the savings from the rate reductions to annuity holders.  The bill also 
11specifies that certain deductions related to annuities may be deducted from annuity 
12considerations for tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020.
