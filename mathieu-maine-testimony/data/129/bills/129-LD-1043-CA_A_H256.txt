Undetennined future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This legislation extends the timeframe from the 2018-2019 school year to the 2023-2024 school year to acheive the 
goal of providing adequate state start-up funding to ensure that public preschool programs for children 4 years of age 
are offered by all school administrative units (SAU's). The total amount of funding needed to meet this goal by the 
2023-2024 school year can not be determined at this time. LD 1001, the proposed budge~ for the 2020-2021 biennium 
includes a $7,000,000 General Fund appropriation in fiscal year 2020-21 towards achieving the goal of making public 
preschool programs available to all Maine students. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to submit recommendations to the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs for the implementation of universal public preschool for children 4 years of age, 
including funding options that will encourage SAU's to implement new public preschool programs or expand existing 
programs, can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
