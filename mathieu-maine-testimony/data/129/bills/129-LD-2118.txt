7of a proposed action.  For the purposes of this section, "proposed action" means a

10other policy statements or actions, including but not limited to guidance documents and 
11directives, regarding issues that may directly affect one or more of the tribes, including 
12tribal rights in land or other natural resources; the relationship between the State and the 
13tribes; and the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the State and the tribes with respect to 
14one another.
152.  Request for consultation.  A state agency shall request government-to-

20each tribe and to the person designated by each tribe to receive consultation requests. 
21The request must provide no less than 30 days from the date of actual receipt or 35 
22days after the date of mailing, whichever is earlier, for the tribe to either elect to 
23engage in or decline consultation. The request must provide clear information about 
24the proposed action, clearly state the deadline and preferred method for response and 
25provide contact information for the tribal liaison under subsection 5.
26B.  If a statute of limitations, court rule or other law or rule requires a proposed action

29reasonable effort to consult with the tribe within the time available.

34agency in accordance with subsection 2, paragraph A, the state agency may not make a

36testimony presented at public hearings before joint standing committees of the

9agency who have a direct role in the proposed action and decision-making process; 
10and
11E.  Consultation must be conducted in a manner that ensures the ability of the tribe to 
12provide detailed feedback on the proposed action.

23SUMMARY
24This bill reflects the recommendations of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot 
25Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to establish a formal government-to-
26government consultation process between the tribes and the State.
27The bill establishes a requirement that state agencies consult with the tribes prior to 
28engaging in any proposed action that may directly affect the tribes. It requires state 
29agencies to request tribal consultation in writing and to provide the tribes with at least 30 
30days to respond and to agree to or decline consultation. If a state agency is required by 
31outside legal factors to act earlier, the State must provide as much time for consultation as 
32possible. If a tribe agrees to consultation, the State must provide preliminary drafts or 
33proposals to the tribe and engage in meaningful and timely in-person consultation. The 
34State must explain in writing to the tribe how it has or has not addressed tribal concerns.
35The bill requires tribal consent prior to proposed actions that could cause substantial 
36or irreparable harm to tribal communities or tribal rights, including but not limited to 
37reserved treaty rights and other tribal rights in land, water and other natural resources.
38The bill authorizes the State to enter into cooperative agreements with federally 
39recognized Indian tribes within the State to facilitate cross-jurisdictional cooperation and 
40the delivery of government services and to avoid disputes.
Page 6 - 129LR3214(01)-11The bill establishes the annual assembly of the Governor and chiefs of each tribe and 
2the biennial legislative assembly to discuss issues relating to the relationship between the 
3State and the tribes.
4The bill directs the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission to report, by November 
515, 2020, on its study of alternative dispute resolution options and best practices for 
6facilitating resolution of tribal-state disputes. It authorizes the joint standing committee of 
7the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters to report out legislation based 
8on the recommendations of the commission.
9Finally, the bill directs the Governor to work with the chiefs of each tribe to establish 
10the Bicentennial Accord in order to institutionalize general principles governing tribal-
11state relations.  It directs the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission to provide logistical 
12support and technical assistance in developing the Bicentennial Accord.
