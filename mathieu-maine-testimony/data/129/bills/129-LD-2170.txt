Page 1 - 129LR3299(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, rules governing attorney training, standards and qualifications adopted by 
4the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services are designated as major substantive 
5rules; and
6Whereas, the rules governing attorney training, standards and qualifications need 
7immediate strengthening, as recommended by the Sixth Amendment Center; and
8Whereas, waiting for submission of stronger rules to the 130th Legislature prolongs 
9the existing challenges to those in need of high-quality attorneys appointed to represent 
10indigent defendants, juveniles, parents and others; and
11Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
13immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
14therefore,
15Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
16Sec. 1.  4 MRSA §1804, sub-§4, ¶D, as amended by PL 2013, c. 368, Pt. RRR, 
17§1 and affected by §4, is further amended to read:
18D.  Adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Rules adopted pursuant to 
19this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
20subchapter 2-A, except that rules adopted to establish standards under subsection 2, 
21paragraph B and rates of compensation for assigned counsel and contract counsel 
22under subsection 2, paragraph F are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, 
23chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  Notwithstanding this paragraph, until October 1, 2021, 
24rules adopted to establish standards under subsection 2, paragraph B are routine 
25technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A; and
26Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
27legislation takes effect when approved.
28SUMMARY
29This bill amends the provisions governing the rule-making authority of the Maine 
30Commission on Indigent Legal Services to create a time period during which the rules 
31governing attorney training, standards and qualifications are routine technical rules.  This 
32allows the commission to adopt strengthened rules through regular rulemaking and have 
33the rules in place more quickly than the major substantive rules process would allow.  
34Any rules adopted after October 1, 2021 are major substantive rules.
