SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, changes the title and 
replaces the bill. It amends the State's litter law to clarify that waste materials resulting 
from the outdoor release or abandonm~nt of a balloon constitute litter under that law. 
The amendment also provides that it is a violation of the litter law for a person to 
intentionally release outdoors a balloon that is inflated or filled with a gas that is lighter 
than air, except for a balloon carrying scientific instrumentation, a balloon used for 
meteorological observation by a governmental or scientific organization or a hot air 
balloon that is recovered after launching. It applies a civil penalty of not less than $100 
and not more than $500 for the illegal intentional release of up to 10 balloons and a civil 
penalty of not less than $500 for the illegal intentional release of more than 10 balloons.
