Page 1 - 129LR1426(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §871, sub-§1-B is enacted to read:
31-B.  Verification required.  An employer shall register with and use the federal 
4immigration verification system to determine the work eligibility status of new 
5employees physically performing services in the State.
6Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §871, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2009, c. 637, §2, is further 
7amended to read:
82.  Penalty.  Violation of subsection 1 or 1-A is a Class E crime.  It is an affirmative 
9defense to prosecution under subsection 1 that the employer, before employing a person 
10or referring a person for employment, made a good faith inquiry as to whether that person 
11was a United States citizen or an alien, and if the inquiry reasonably indicated that the 
12person was an alien, the employer made a further good faith inquiry that reasonably 
13indicated used the federal immigration verification system to verify that the alien was 
14lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or that the United States 
15Immigration and Naturalization Service had authorized the alien to accept employment in 
16the United States.
17A.  A good faith inquiry under this subsection must be in writing.  An employment 
18application form that requests citizenship data, or an alien registration number if the 
19applicant is an alien, meets the requirement of a good faith inquiry in writing.
20B.  A social security account number card is not considered evidence of the United 
21States Immigration and Naturalization Service's authorization for an alien to accept 
22employment in the United States.
