26SUMMARY
27This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, makes the 
28following changes to the bill.
291.  It makes several changes to the provisions of the bill affecting the definitions of 
30terms used in the State's liquor laws, including by clarifying that agency liquor stores sell 
31not only spirits but also malt liquor and wine, streamlining the definitions of "hotel guest" 
32and "bed and breakfast guest" and clarifying that tenant breweries may produce not only 
33malt liquor but also low-alcohol spirits products.
342.  It makes several technical corrections to the bill, including removing statutory 
35language made redundant by the bill's new definition of "spirits supplier" and moving the 
36provision of the bill identifying which products a sponsored spirits manufacturer may 
37provide for sampling at a taste-testing festival to the appropriate paragraph of the statute 
38governing those taste-testing festivals.
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 766, L.D. 2131
Page 8 - 129LR3164(02)-1
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT13.  It reorganizes language in the bill to reflect that the Department of Administrative 
2and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations makes 
3recommendations to the State Liquor and Lottery Commission regarding the retail prices 
4of spirits sold in the State before the bureau establishes the wholesale price of those 
5spirits.
64.  It corrects an error of law indicating that licensed Class A restaurants and Class A 
7restaurants/lounges must purchase spirits that they will offer to customers as 
8complimentary samples from the bureau and instead provides that those spirits must be 
9purchased from reselling agents.
105.  It removes the requirements in current law that retailers who seek written 
11permission from the bureau to conduct spirits, wine or malt liquor taste-testing events 
12provide the names of any licensed sales representatives who will be pouring samples at 
13those events.
146.  It harmonizes the bill with Public Law 2019, chapter 615 and Public Law 2019, 
15chapter 665, including by removing provisions of the bill amending statutes repealed in 
16those laws, removing provisions of the bill enacting statutes already enacted in those 
17laws, aligning the definition of "out-of-state spirits supplier" enacted in Public Law 2019, 
18chapter 665, section 10 with the provisions of Public Law 2019, chapter 615 and 
19correcting cross-references.
207.  It aligns the liquor importation and transportation statutes with other provisions of 
21the bill and current law by clarifying that wineries, small wineries and tenant wineries 
22may import spirits or purchase spirits manufactured in the State for the purpose of 
23producing fortified wine and that breweries, small breweries and tenant breweries may 
24import spirits or purchase spirits manufactured in the State for the purpose of producing 
25low-alcohol spirits products containing malt liquor.
