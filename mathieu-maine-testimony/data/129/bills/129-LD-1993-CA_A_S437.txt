The bill provides an exemption to corporate income tax for a manufacturer of alcoholic spirits located outside of the 
State whose only nexus with the State is the storage of the manufacturer's spirits in a warehouse operated by the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services. It would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of 
$144,375 in fiscal year 2020-21 and a reduction in Local Government Fund revenue of $5,625 in fiscal year 2020-21.
