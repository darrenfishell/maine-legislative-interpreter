20 Governor, members of the Legislature, constitutional officers and the staff or agents of 
21 these officials from soliciting or accepting contributions from a lobbyist, lobbyist 
22 associate, employer of a lobbyist or a lobbying firm while the Legislature is convened in 
23 session. The amendment clarifies that this prohibition does not apply to a contribution 
24 unless the contribution is the property of the lobbyist, lobbyist associate, employer of a 
25 lobbyist or lobbying firm. 
26 The amendment also newly prohibits the Governor, a member of the Legislature or 
27 the staff or agent of these officials from soliciting or accepting contributions from a 
28 lobbyist or lobbyist associate when the Legislature is not in session, unless the lobbyist or 
29 lobbyist associate is eligible to vote or will be eligible to vote on the day of the election in 
30 a district where the Governor or member of the Legislature will appear on the ballot. 
31 Similarly, the amendment prohibits a gubernatorial or legislative candidate and the staff 
32 or agent of these persons from soliciting or accepting contributions from:. a lobbyist or 
33 lobbyist associate at any time unless the lobbyist or lobbyist associate is eligible to vote 
34 or will be eligible to vote on the day of the election in a district where the gubernatorial or 
35 legislative candidate will appear on the ballot. 
36 The amendment further clarifies the authority of the Commission on Governmental 
37 Ethics and Election Practices to undertake investigations to determine whether any person 
38 has improperly solicited, accepted, given or promised a contribution. A contribution 
39 made in violation of the law must be returned to the contributor.
