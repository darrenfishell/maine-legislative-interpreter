Page 4 - 129LR0202(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill defines and regulates the use of electric bicycles, which are bicycles with a 
3motor and which fall into one of 3 classes, depending on the top speed attainable and 
4whether the operator needs to pedal while the motor is propelling the electric bicycle.  
5The bill provides that an operator of an electric bicycle has generally the same rights and 
6obligations as the operator of a bicycle, except that the use of an electric bicycle on 
7bicycle paths and bikeways may be restricted by the entity having jurisdiction over the 
8bicycle path or bikeway.  An electric bicycle is considered a vehicle for purposes of the 
9State's so-called open container law and, as with bicycles, any person under 16 years of 
10age who is operating or riding as a passenger on an electric bicycle must wear a helmet.
