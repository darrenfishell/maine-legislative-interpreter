3is amended to read:
4§1718-D.  Prohibition on balance billing for surprise bills; disputes of surprise bills 
5for uninsured patients and persons covered under self-insured health benefit 
6plans
71.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
8following terms have the following meanings.
9A.  "Enrollee" has the same meaning as in Title 24-A, section 4301-A, subsection 5.
10B.  "Health plan" has the same meaning as in Title 24-A, section 4301-A, subsection 
117.
12B-1.  "Knowingly elected to obtain the services from an out-of-network provider" 
13means that an enrollee chose the services of a specific provider, with full knowledge 
14that the provider is an out-of-network provider with respect to the enrollee's health 
15plan, under circumstances that indicate that the enrollee had and was informed of the 
16opportunity to receive services from a network provider but instead selected the out-
17of-network provider. The disclosure by a provider of network status does not render 
18an enrollee's decision to proceed with treatment from that provider a choice made 
19knowingly pursuant to this paragraph.
20C.  "Provider" has the same meaning as in Title 24-A, section 4301-A, subsection 16.
21D.  "Surprise bill" has the same meaning as in Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 
221.
23E.  "Visit" means any interaction between an enrollee and one or more providers for 
24the purpose of assessing the health status of an enrollee or providing one or more 
25health care services between the time an enrollee enters a facility and the time an 
26enrollee is discharged.
272.  Prohibition on balance billing.  An out-of-network provider reimbursed for a 
28surprise bill under Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 2, paragraph B may not bill an 
29enrollee for health care services beyond the applicable coinsurance, copayment, 
30deductible or other out-of-pocket cost expense that would be imposed for the health care 
31services if the services were rendered by a network provider under the enrollee's health 
32plan.  An out-of-network provider is also subject to the following with respect to any 
33overpayment made by an enrollee.
34A.  If an out-of-network provider provides health care services covered under an 
35enrollee's health plan and the out-of-network provider receives payment from the 
36enrollee for health care services for which the enrollee is not responsible pursuant to 
37this subsection, the out-of-network provider shall reimburse the enrollee within 30 
38calendar days after the earlier of the date that the provider received notice of the 
39overpayment and the date the provider became aware of the overpayment.
Page 2 - 129LR2881(01)-11B.  An out-of-network provider that fails to reimburse an enrollee for an overpayment 
2as required by paragraph A shall pay interest on the overpayment at the rate of 10% 
3per annum beginning on the earlier of the date the provider received notice of the 
4overpayment and the date the provider became aware of the overpayment. An 
5enrollee is not required to request the accrued interest from the out-of-network 
6provider in order to receive interest with the reimbursement amount.
73.  Uninsured patients; disputes of surprise bills.  An uninsured patient who has 
8received a surprise bill from a provider for one or more health care services rendered 
9during a single visit totaling $750 or more may dispute the bill and request resolution of 
10the dispute using the process under Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 3.  The 
11independent dispute resolution entity contracted to resolve the dispute over the surprise 
12bill shall select either the out-of-network provider's fee or the uninsured patient's 
13proposed payment amount in accordance with Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 3. 
14In the case of emergency or other medically necessary care, an uninsured patient may not 
15be charged by a provider more than the amounts generally billed to a patient who has 
16insurance covering such care as determined using the method described in 26 Code of 
17Federal Regulations, Section 1.501(r)-5, paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4). A provider shall hold 
18the uninsured patient harmless for the duration of the independent dispute resolution 
19process and may not seek payment until the independent dispute resolution process is 
20completed.  Notwithstanding Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 3, paragraph F, 
21payment for the independent dispute resolution process is the responsibility of the 
22provider. In the event a claim includes more than one health care service rendered during 
23a single visit, the independent dispute resolution entity may allocate the prorated 
24independent dispute resolution costs at its discretion among providers.
254.  Person covered under self-insured health benefit plan; disputes of surprise 
26bills.  A person covered under a self-insured health benefit plan that is not subject to the 
27provisions of Title 24-A, section 4303-C pursuant to Title 24-A, section 4303-C, 
28subsection 4 and who has received a surprise bill may dispute the bill and request 
29resolution of the dispute using the process under Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 
303.  The independent dispute resolution entity contracted to resolve the dispute over the 
31surprise bill shall select either the out-of-network provider's fee or the covered person's 
32proposed payment amount in accordance with Title 24-A, section 4303-C, subsection 3.
335.  Applicability.  Subsections 3 and 4 do not apply to an uninsured patient or person 
34covered under a self-insured health benefit plan who knowingly elected to obtain the 
35services from an out-of-network provider.
36Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4303-C, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 218, §2 and affected by 
37§3, is amended to read:
38§4303-C.  Protection from surprise bills
391.  Surprise bill defined.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise 
40indicates, "surprise bill" means a bill for health care services, other than including, but not 
41limited to, emergency services, received by an enrollee for covered services rendered by 
42an out-of-network provider, when such services were rendered by that out-of-network 
43provider at a network provider, during a service or procedure performed by a network 
Page 3 - 129LR2881(01)-11provider or during a service or procedure previously approved or authorized by the carrier 
2and the enrollee did not knowingly elect to obtain such services from that out-of-network 
3provider. "Surprise bill" does not include a bill for health care services received by an 
4enrollee when a network provider was available to render the services and the enrollee 
5knowingly elected to obtain the services from another provider who was an out-of-
6network provider.
71-A.  "Knowingly elect to obtain such services from that out-of-network 
8provider" defined.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, 
9"knowingly elect to obtain such services from that out-of-network provider" means that 
10an enrollee chose the services of a specific provider, with full knowledge that the 
11provider is an out-of-network provider with respect to the enrollee's health plan, under 
12circumstances that indicate that the enrollee had and was informed of the opportunity to 
13receive services from a network provider but instead selected the out-of-network 
14provider. The disclosure by a provider of network status does not render an enrollee's 
15decision to proceed with treatment from that provider a choice made knowingly pursuant 
16to this subsection.
172.  Requirements.  With respect to a surprise bill:
18A.  A carrier shall require an enrollee to pay only the applicable coinsurance, 
19copayment, deductible or other out-of-pocket expense that would be imposed for 
20health care services if the services were rendered by a network provider;
21B.  A carrier shall reimburse the out-of-network provider or enrollee, as applicable, 
22for health care services rendered at the average network rate under the enrollee's 
23health care plan as payment in full, unless the carrier and out-of-network provider 
24agree otherwise.  If an out-of-network provider disagrees with a carrier's payment 
25amount, the carrier and the out-of-network provider have 30 calendar days to 
26negotiate an agreement on the payment amount in good faith.  If the carrier and the 
27out-of-network provider do not reach agreement on the payment amount within 30 
28calendar days, the out-of-network provider may submit a dispute regarding the 
29payment and receive another payment from the carrier determined in accordance with 
30the dispute resolution process in subsection 3, including any payment made pursuant 
31to subsection 3, paragraph G; and
32C.  Notwithstanding paragraph B, if a carrier has an inadequate network, as 
33determined by the superintendent, the carrier shall ensure that the enrollee obtains the 
34covered service at no greater cost to the enrollee than if the service were obtained 
35from a network provider or shall make other arrangements acceptable to the 
36superintendent.
373.  Dispute resolution process for surprise bills.  The superintendent shall establish 
38an independent dispute resolution process by which a dispute for a surprise bill in 
39accordance with subsection 2 may be resolved as provided in this subsection.
40A.  The superintendent may select an independent dispute resolution entity to conduct 
41the dispute resolution process. The superintendent shall adopt rules establishing 
42standards for the dispute resolution process, including a process for certifying and 
43selecting independent dispute resolution entities.  An independent dispute resolution 
Page 4 - 129LR2881(01)-11entity shall use licensed physicians in active practice in the same or similar specialty 
2as the physician providing the service that is subject to the dispute resolution process.  
3To the extent practicable, the physician must be licensed in this State.  Rules adopted 
4pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
5375, subchapter 2-A.
6B.  An independent dispute resolution entity shall make a decision within 30 days of 
7receipt of the dispute for review.
8C.  In determining a reasonable fee for the health care services rendered, an 
9independent dispute resolution entity shall select either the carrier's payment or the 
10out-of-network provider's fee. The independent dispute resolution entity shall 
11determine which amount to select based upon the conditions and factors set forth in 
12this paragraph.  In determining the reasonable fee for a health care service, an 
13independent dispute resolution entity shall consider all relevant factors, including:
14(1)  Whether there is a gross disparity between the fee charged by the out-of-
15network provider for services rendered as compared to:
16(a)  Fees paid to the provider for the same services rendered by the provider 
17to other enrollees in a carrier's health plans in which the provider is not 
18participating; and
19(b)  Fees paid by the carrier to reimburse similarly qualified providers for the 
20same services in the same region who are not participating with the carrier;
21(2)  The out-of-network provider's level of training, education, specialization, 
22quality and experience and, in the case of a hospital, the teaching staff, scope of 
23services and case mix;
24(3)  The out-of-network provider's contracted rates for comparable services in the 
25same geographic area with regard to patients in health care plans in which the 
26provider is not participating;
27(4)  The circumstances and complexity of the particular case, including time and 
28place of the service;
29(5)  Individual patient characteristics; and
30(6)  The usual and customary cost of the health care service as determined by the 
3180th percentile of the particular health care service performed by a provider in the 
32same or similar specialty, as determined by the all-payer claims database 
33maintained by the Maine Health Data Organization or, if Maine Health Data 
34Organization claims data is insufficient or otherwise inapplicable, another 
35independent medical claims database. If authorized by rule, the superintendent 
36may enter into an agreement to obtain data from an independent medical claims 
37database to carry out the functions of this subparagraph.
38D.  If an independent dispute resolution entity determines, based on the carrier's 
39payment and the out-of-network provider's fee, that a settlement between the carrier 
40and out-of-network provider is reasonably likely, or that both the carrier's payment 
41and the out-of-network provider's fee represent unreasonable extremes, the 
42independent dispute resolution entity may direct both parties to attempt a good faith 
Page 5 - 129LR2881(01)-11negotiation for settlement. The carrier and out-of-network provider may be granted 
2up to 10 business days for this negotiation, which runs concurrently with the 30-day 
3period for dispute resolution.
4E.  The determination of an independent dispute resolution entity is binding on the 
5carrier, out-of-network provider and enrollee and is admissible in any court 
6proceeding between the carrier, out-of-network provider and enrollee or in any 
7administrative proceeding between this State and the provider.
8F.  When an independent dispute resolution entity determines the carrier's payment is 
9reasonable, payment for the dispute resolution process is the responsibility of the out-
10of-network provider. When the independent dispute resolution entity determines the 
11out-of-network provider's fee is reasonable, payment for the dispute resolution 
12process is the responsibility of the carrier. When a good faith negotiation directed by 
13the independent dispute resolution entity results in a settlement between the carrier 
14and the out-of-network provider, the carrier and the out-of-network provider shall 
15evenly divide and share the prorated cost for dispute resolution.
16G.  In a dispute for a surprise bill, when the difference between the out-of-network 
17provider's charge and the average network rate under the enrollee's health plan 
18pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph B, including any applicable enrollee cost sharing, 
19is less than $750, a carrier shall reimburse the out-of-network provider directly for 
20the provider's charges and the enrollee cost sharing for the services rendered as long 
21as the provider's charges do not exceed the 80th percentile of charges for the 
22particular health care service performed by a health care professional in the same or 
23similar specialty and provided in the same geographical area as reported in a 
24benchmarking database specified by the superintendent and maintained by a 
25nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with and does not receive funding from a 
26carrier. An out-of-network provider may dispute more than one bill with the same 
27carrier for the same health care service under this subsection as long as the total of 
28the bills with that carrier for that health care service exceeds $750.
29H.  The superintendent shall enforce the determination of an independent dispute 
30resolution entity pursuant to this subsection or any agreement made by a carrier and 
31an out-of-network provider after the conclusion of the independent dispute resolution 
32process pursuant to this subsection. The superintendent may use any powers provided 
33to the superintendent under this Title.
344.  Self-insured health benefit plans.  An entity providing or administering a self-
35insured health benefit plan exempted from the applicability of this section under the 
36federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 United States Code, 
37Sections 1001 to 1461 (1988) may elect to be subject to the provisions of this section. In 
38the event an entity providing or administering a self-insured health benefit plan elects to 
39be subject to the provisions of this section, the provisions of this section apply to a self-
40insured health benefit plan and its members in the same manner as the provisions of this 
41section apply to a carrier and its enrollees. To elect to be subject to the provisions of this 
42section, the entity shall provide notice, on an annual basis, to the superintendent, on a 
43form and in a manner prescribed by the superintendent, attesting to the entity's 
44participation and agreeing to be bound by the provisions of this section. The entity shall 
Page 6 - 129LR2881(01)-11amend the health benefit plan, coverage policies, contracts and any other plan documents 
2to reflect that the provisions of this section apply to the plan's members.
35.  Information required from carriers.  As part of the carrier's annual public 
4regulatory filings made to the superintendent, a carrier shall submit in a form and manner 
5determined by the superintendent information related to:
6A.  The use of out-of-network providers by enrollees and the impact on premium 
7affordability and benefit design; and
8B.  The number of claims submitted by a provider to the carrier that are denied or 
9down coded by the carrier and the reason for the denial or down coding 
10determination.
116.  Report from superintendent.  On or before January 31st annually, beginning 
12January 1, 2022, the superintendent shall report the following information received from 
13all carriers in the aggregate:
14A.  The number of requests for independent dispute resolution filed pursuant to this 
15section between January 1st and December 31st of the previous calendar year, 
16including the percentage of all claims that were subject to dispute. For each 
17independent dispute resolution determination, the carrier shall provide aggregate 
18information that does not identify any provider, carrier, enrollee or uninsured patient 
19involved in each determination about:
20(1)  Whether the determination was in favor of the carrier, out-of-network 
21provider or uninsured patient;
22(2)  The payment amount offered by each side of the independent dispute 
23resolution process and the award amount from the independent dispute resolution 
24determination;
25(3)  The category and practice specialty of each out-of-network provider 
26involved, as applicable; and
27(4)  A description of the health care service that was subject to dispute;
28B.  The percentage of facilities and hospital-based professionals, by specialty, that are 
29in network for each carrier in this State as reported in access plans submitted to the 
30superintendent;
31C.  The number of complaints the superintendent receives relating to out-of-network 
32health care charges;
33D.  Annual trends on health benefit plan premium rates, the total annual amount of 
34spending on inadvertent and emergency out-of-network costs by carriers and medical 
35loss ratios in the State to the extent that the information is available;
36E.  The number of physician specialists practicing in the State in a particular specialty 
37and whether they are in network or out of network with respect to the carriers that 
38administer the state employee group health plan under Title 5, section 285, the Maine 
39Education Association benefits trust health plan, the qualified health plans offered 
40pursuant to the federal Affordable Care Act and other health benefit plans offered in 
41the State;
Page 7 - 129LR2881(01)-11F.  A summary of the information submitted to the superintendent pursuant to 
2subsection 5 concerning the number of claims submitted by health care providers to 
3carriers that are denied or down coded by the carrier and the reasons for the denials or 
4down coding determinations;
5G.  An analysis of the impact of this section, with respect to both emergency services 
6and other health care services, on premium affordability and the breadth of provider 
7networks; and
8H.  Any other benchmarks or information that the superintendent considers 
9appropriate to make publicly available to further the goals of this section.
10The superintendent shall submit the report to the joint standing committee of the 
11Legislature having jurisdiction over health insurance matters and shall post the report on 
12the bureau's publicly accessible website.
13Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4303-E is enacted to read:
14§4303-E.  Payment after resolution of surprise bill disputes
15Following an independent dispute resolution determination pursuant to section 
164303-C, subsection 3, the determination by the independent dispute resolution entity of a 
17reasonable payment for a specific health care service or treatment rendered by an out-of-
18network provider is binding on a carrier, out-of-network provider and enrollee for 90 
19days.  During that 90-day period, a carrier shall reimburse an out-of-network provider at 
20that same rate for that specific health care service or treatment and an out-of-network 
21provider may not dispute any bill for that service under section 4303-C.
22Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §4320-C, as amended by PL 2019, c. 238, §3, is further 
23amended to read:
24§4320-C.  Emergency services
25If a carrier offering a health plan provides or covers any benefits with respect to 
26services in an emergency facility or setting, the plan must cover emergency services 
27without prior authorization.  Cost-sharing requirements, expressed such as a deductible, 
28copayment amount or coinsurance rate, for out-of-network services are the same as 
29requirements that would apply if such services were provided in network, and any 
30payment made by an enrollee pursuant to this section must be applied to the enrollee's in-
31network cost-sharing limit. Except with respect to a surprise bill for emergency services 
32as provided for in section 4303-C, the enrollee's responsibility for payment for covered 
33out-of-network emergency services must be limited so that if the enrollee has paid the 
34enrollee's share of the charge as specified in the plan for in-network services, the carrier 
35shall hold the enrollee harmless from any additional amount owed to an out-of-network 
36provider for covered emergency services and make payment to the out-of-network 
37provider in accordance with subsection 1.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State 
38shall also comply with the requirements of section 4304, subsection 5.
391.  Payments for out-of-network emergency services.  With respect to any bill for 
40covered emergency services by an out-of-network provider, except for a surprise bill as 
41defined in section 4303-C, subsection 1, the following provisions apply.
Page 8 - 129LR2881(01)-11A.  A carrier shall reimburse the out-of-network provider or enrollee, as applicable, 
2for health care services rendered at the average network rate under the enrollee's 
3health care plan as payment in full, unless the carrier and out-of-network provider 
4agree otherwise.
5B.  If a carrier cannot reach an agreement under paragraph A with an out-of-network 
6provider that is not subject to the requirements in this chapter, the carrier shall hold 
7the enrollee harmless.
8C.  An out-of-network provider may not collect or attempt to collect any charge from 
9an enrollee for covered health care services under this section beyond the applicable 
10coinsurance, copayment, deductible or other out-of-pocket cost expense that would 
11be imposed for the health care services if the services were rendered by a network 
12provider under the enrollee's health plan, notwithstanding the carrier's insolvency, the 
13carrier's failure to pay the amount owed by the carrier or any other breach by the 
14carrier of any provider agreement. If an out-of-network provider provides covered 
15emergency services and the provider receives payment from the covered person for 
16services for which the covered person is not responsible pursuant to this section, the 
17provider shall reimburse the covered person within 30 calendar days after the earlier 
18of the date that the overpayment was reported to the provider and the date the 
19provider became aware of the overpayment.  An out-of-network provider that fails to 
20reimburse a covered person as required by this paragraph for an overpayment shall 
21pay interest on the overpayment at the rate of 10% per annum beginning on the 
22earlier of the date the provider received the notice of the overpayment and the date 
23the provider became aware of the overpayment. The covered person is not required to 
24request the accrued interest from the out-of-network provider in order to receive 
25interest with the reimbursement amount.
26SUMMARY
27This bill amends the law providing consumer protection for surprise medical bills to 
28include surprise bills for emergency services.  In the event of a dispute with respect to a 
29surprise medical bill, the bill directs the Superintendent of Insurance to develop an 
30independent dispute resolution process to determine a reasonable payment for health care 
31services.
