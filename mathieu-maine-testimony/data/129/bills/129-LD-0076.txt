Page 1 - 129LR0483(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  1 MRSA ยง1024, sub-ยง1-A is enacted to read:
31-A.  Actions precluded beginning with the 130th Legislature.  Beginning with the 
4convening of the 130th Legislature, a person who has served as a Legislator may not 
5engage in compensated lobbying until 4 years after that person's term as a Legislator 
6ends.
7Sec. 2.  1 MRSA ยง1024, sub-ยง4 is enacted to read:
84.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
9following terms have the following meanings.
10A.  "Compensated lobbying" means lobbying conducted by an individual who is 
11specifically employed by another person for that purpose or lobbying conducted by 
12an individual as a regular employee of another person.  "Compensated lobbying" does 
13not include activities for which the individual receives no compensation other than 
14reimbursement for lobbying-related travel within the State and reimbursement for 
15other out-of-pocket expenditures made by the individual for printing, postage and 
16food and lodging connected with lobbying activities paid for by the individual.  For 
17the purposes of this paragraph, "reimbursement for other out-of-pocket expenditures" 
18does not include reimbursement for the individual's time spent lobbying that would 
19have been otherwise compensated by an employer or in the course of the individual's 
20employment.
21B.  "Lobbying" has the same meaning as in Title 3, section 312-A, subsection 9.
22SUMMARY
23This bill prohibits a former Legislator from engaging in any compensated lobbying 
24activities for 4 years after that person's term as a Legislator ends rather than for one year 
25as in current law.  This extended prohibition begins with the convening of the 130th 
26Legislature.  The bill also removes the safe harbor in current law that allows a former 
27Legislator to engage in up to 8 hours of compensated lobbying per calendar month 
28without violating the prohibition.
