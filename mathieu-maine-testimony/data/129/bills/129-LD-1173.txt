2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §2305-B, sub-§§1 and 2, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 110, 
3§2, are amended to read:
41.  Transmission and distribution utilities; direct electric service.  A transmission 
5and distribution utility or a person that provides direct electric service approved in 
6accordance with section 3321, subsection 3 may construct and maintain its lines in, upon, 
7along, over, across or under the roads and streets in any municipality in which it is 
8authorized to supply electricity, subject to the conditions and restrictions provided in this 
9chapter and chapter 25.
102.  Persons other than transmission and distribution utilities.  A person other than 
11a transmission and distribution utility or a person that provides direct electric service 
12approved in accordance with section 3321, subsection 3 may not construct or maintain 
13electric lines, including poles or other related structures, in, upon, along, over, across or 
14under a road, street or other public way unless:
15A.  The person satisfies the requirements of section 2503;
16B.  The person or the person's contractor hired to construct the line provides to the 
17applicable licensing authority a performance bond:
18(1)  In the amount of the value of the line, including poles or other related 
19structures, to be located in the public way; and
20(2)  That is enforceable for one year from the date the line is energized;
21C.  Prior to constructing the line, the person notifies the transmission and distribution 
22utility in whose service territory the line is proposed to be built of the proposed 
23location of the line; and
24D.  If a public utility objects to the line on the basis that it may constitute a 
25duplication of existing transmission or distribution facilities or may interfere with the 
26adequate and safe delivery of electricity to others, the commission issues a finding 
27that the line is not a duplication of existing transmission or distribution facilities and 
28does not interfere with the adequate and safe delivery of electricity to others.  A 
29finding is not required under this paragraph unless a public utility has objected in 
30writing to the applicable licensing authority.
