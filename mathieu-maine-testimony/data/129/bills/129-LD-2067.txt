7each election.
8A.  An application must be made by a voter using procedures designed by the 
9Secretary of State.  These procedures must include a process for notifying the voter 
10that if the voter moves out of the municipality, that voter's status as an ongoing

20(5)  The designation of the voter's status as inactive in the central voter 
21registration system.
22This subsection does not apply to uniformed service voters or overseas voters who are 
23covered by the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 52 United 
24States Code, Section 20302 (2019).

3make a good faith effort to notify the voter within 24 hours by mail, telephone or e-mail 
4of the procedure by which the voter may cure the discrepancy, correct the missing 
5signature or properly complete the affidavit on the return envelope.  If the signatures 
6appear to have been made by the same person and if the affidavit is properly completed, 
7the clerk shall write "OK" and the clerk's initials on the return envelope.  Otherwise, the 
8clerk shall note any discrepancy on the return envelope. 
9A.  If the signatures do not appear to have been made by the same person, but this 
10discrepancy is apparently the result of the voter's having properly obtained assistance 
11under either section 753-A, subsection 5, or section 754-A, subsection 3, or both, 
12then the clerk shall note the discrepancy on the return envelope, but shall also write
