25 SUMMARY 
26 This amendment removes the sections of the bill that require additional cost-of-living 
27 adjustments to nursing facilities and residential care facilities and supplemental 
28 allowances for facilities with a high proportion of MaineCare residents and facilities with 
29 specialty beds. It retains the requirements for the 10% one-time supplemental payment 
30 provided in Public Law 2017, chapter 460, Part B to nursing facilities and residential care 
31 facilities to continue in successive years until rebasing incorporates the increase, but the 
32 amendment removes the retroactive requirement to include contract labor. It retains the 
33 requirement to grant an additional 10% increase that is carried forward until rebasing 
34 incorporates the increase, but it removes the language relating to requiring increases to go 
35 to routine care cost components of the rates. It removes the specific prohibition upon the 
36 Department of Health and Human Services to require a nursing facility or residential care

1 facility to demonstrate how increased reimbursement is applied to wages and benefits to 
2 direct care workers but specifies that the increased reimbursement is not limited to only 
3 wages and wage-related costs. It removes the retroactivity section of the bill but retains 
4 the emergency provision of the bill. It adds an appropriations and allocations section.

The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $16,283, 173 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $12,740,825 in fiscal year 2020-21 for residential care facility and nursing facility wage 
allowances. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for the FMAP match. 
The Upper Payment Limit (UPL) analysis for Nursing Facilities (NF) indicates that currently the NF payments in 
MaineCare are lower than Medicare by $12.5 million. The annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) for the NF's will 
go into effect on July 1, 2019 and are estimated to increase the payments by $10.6 million. The impact of this change 
on the UPL will be limited by an increase to the Medicare rates to which the MaineCare rates are compared, but 
between the COLA and the cost from this bill, the NF costs will likely go over the UPL threshold. However, based on 
the language in statute (Title 22 § 1708 sub-§3, ,rq, the DHHS must establish reimbursement rates that "are consistent 
with federal requirements relative to limits on reimbursement under the federal Social Security Act, Title XIX." Thus, 
the estimate of costs above includes all increases associated with the bill, with a federal match. If this does create a 
UPL issue, the DHHS will limit the payments to NF's to remain below the federally required limits.
