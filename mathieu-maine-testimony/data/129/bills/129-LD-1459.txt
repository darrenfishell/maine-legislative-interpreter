17dealing with such handler. The purpose of this Article is to provide standards for the 
18qualification of agricultural cooperative organizations for bargaining purposes, to define

26SUMMARY
27Current law authorizes the membership of farmers in cooperative organizations and 
28requires handlers of agricultural products to bargain in good faith with such organizations 
29because agricultural products are produced by numerous individual farmers and the 
30marketing and bargaining position of individual farmers will be adversely affected unless 
31they are able to join together.  This bill recognizes that market forces that affect the 
32marketing and bargaining position of individual farmers similarly affect the marketing 
33and bargaining position of individual harvesters and haulers of forest products, and it 
34expands application of the Maine Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act of 1973 to 
35include harvesters and haulers of forest products.
36Specifically, this bill amends the laws governing agricultural marketing and 
37bargaining to:
Page 3 - 129LR0225(01)-111.  Expand the definition of "independent agricultural contractor" to include a person 
2who harvests or hauls forest products under contract;
32.  Expand the legislative findings provision to include findings concerning 
4independent agricultural contractors, which include harvesters and haulers of forest 
5products; and
63.  Include in the definition of "producer" a person engaged in the production of 
7forest products.
8In addition, the bill sets forth the Legislature's finding that, with respect to loggers 
9and forest products haulers, the inequity of power in determining compensation and the 
10lack of opportunity to join together in bargaining over compensation can result in unfair 
11contract rates for their services and that it is in the public interest to expand application of 
12the Maine Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act of 1973 to include harvesters and 
13haulers of forest products.
