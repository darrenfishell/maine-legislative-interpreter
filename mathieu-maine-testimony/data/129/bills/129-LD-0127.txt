35SUMMARY
36This bill amends the laws governing the Maine Potato Board to reduce the number of 
37the board's districts from 5 to 3 and the number of assemblies to match the reduction in 
38districts, to reduce the number of members on assemblies' executive councils so that all 
39executive councils have 5 members and to reduce the number of officers an executive 
40council must elect to one, a chair.  It also removes the requirements that the board carry 
41out duties under the laws governing the so-called Maine Bag Program.
