14Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or

16SUMMARY
17This amendment is the majority report of the committee.
18The amendment amends Part A of the bill to repeal the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
1917-A, section 1609, which requires a sentence to be nonconcurrent if it is imposed for a 
20crime committed or attempted to be committed while the person is serving a sentence.  
21The amendment enacts Title 17-A, section 1609-A, which grants to the court discretion to 
22impose a sentence that is nonconcurrent if it is imposed for a crime committed or 
23attempted to be committed while the person is serving a sentence or while a stay of 
24execution of a sentence has been imposed.
25The amendment removes from the bill a proposed amendment to the Sex Offender 
26Registration and Notification Act of 1999 that was included in the bill in error.  The 
27amendment separates 2 variants of kidnapping under Title 17-A, section 301, subsection 
281, paragraph A, subparagraph (3).  The amendment clarifies that the amendments to the 
29Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2013 apply to a crime committed prior 
30to January 1, 2021, if the offense is knowingly restraining another person with the intent 
31to inflict bodily injury, and apply to a crime committed on or after January 1, 2021, if the 
32crime is conduct defined as criminal in Title 17-A, chapter 11. 
33The amendment repeals a section of law in Title 17-A, chapter 11 on factors aiding in 
34predicting high-risk sex offenders for sentencing purposes, leaving individual risk 
35assessment at sentencing to the judgment of the court.
36This amendment adds Part F to the bill, requiring annual written reports from the 
37Maine Information and Analysis Center by February 1st each year beginning February 1, 
382021, to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal 
39justice and public safety matters regarding the performance of the center.  The reports 
40must include a narrative of the types of cases, crimes, incidents and reports the center has 
41reviewed and evaluated in a manner that protects personal privacy and the integrity of the 
42work of the center.  The reports must include both privacy audits performed in the prior
