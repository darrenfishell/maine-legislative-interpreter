SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the credit allowed under the bill to remove the variable 
credit of between 7 ¢ and 12¢ per pound of renewable chemical, which is based on the 
certification level of the contractors hired or retained to harvest the renewable biomass 
and the residency of those contractors' employees, to a flat credit of 8¢ per pound of 
renewable chemical as long as the taxpayer demonstrates to the Department of Economic 
and Community Development that at least 75% of the employees of the contractors hired 
or retained to harvest renewable biomass used in the production of the renewable 
chemicals meet the eligibility conditions specified in the Employment Security Law, in 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, chapter 13. This amendment also delays by one 
year the application date of the tax credit. 
This amendment also corrects numbering conflicts in the bill and Committee 
Amendment "A" created when a chaptered law enacted provisions with the same 
paragraph letter or section number.

The bill as currently engrossed reduced General Fund revenue by $45,125 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $87,875 in fiscal 
year 2022-23 and reduced Other Special Revenue Funds revenue by $2,375 in fiscal year 2021-22 and $4,625 in fiscal 
year 2022-23. This amendment delays the application date one year from on or after January 1, 2020 to on or after 
January 1, 2021. This completely restores the revenue loss in fiscal year 2021-22. The amendment also makes the 
eligibility criteria for entities to qualify for the tax credit more restrictive by increasing the percentage of employees 
of entities hired to harvest renewable biomass that must meet the eligibility conditions for that entity to receive the 
credit from 50% to 75%. Assuming that 25% of the entities who would have met the lower 50% criteria will not meet 
the higher 75% criteria and will not be eligible for the credit, the incremental impact compared to the engrossed bill is 
to increase (reduce the loss) General Fund revenue by $54,03 t in fiscal year 2022-23 and increase Local Govemment 
Fund revenue by $2,844 in fiscal year 2022-23,
