SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the committee amendment. It changes the term "gross 
revenue" to "gross sales" in a provision designating persons who are required to register. 
It changes a subsection headnote to better reflect the substance of the subsection. It 
provides that a marketplace facilitator is considered a retailer for each sale of tangible 
personal property or taxable services for delivery in this State, instead of into this State, 
that the marketplace facilitator facilitates on or through its marketplace.
