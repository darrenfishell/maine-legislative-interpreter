Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Increasing the University of Maine System's bond ceiling from $220,000,000 to $350,000,000 to allow for the 
financing of potential future capital improvement projects may require a General Fund appropriation if, given this 
increased authority, the university system issues bonds that do not generate the anticipated additional revenue and 
require debt service payments from the General Fund.
