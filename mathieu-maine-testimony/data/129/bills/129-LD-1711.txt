4under this chapter provide opportunities for entities other than the standard buyer to 
5aggregate and sell the output of distributed generation resources in the applicable 
6markets.
7§3476.  Commercial or institutional resources procurement
81.  Procurement amounts. By July 1, 2024, the commission shall procure 125 
9megawatts of the output of distributed generation resources associated with commercial 
10or institutional customer accounts by conducting an initial competitive solicitation of 25 
11megawatts to establish market-based, declining block contract rates to procure the 
12remaining 100 megawatts.
132.  Initial competitive procurement.  The following standards apply to the initial 
14competitive procurement under subsection 1 of distributed generation resources from 
15commercial or institutional customers:
16A.  On or before January 1, 2020, the commission shall publish rules for the initial 
17competitive solicitation of 25 megawatts of distributed generation resources under 
18subsection 1. The publication must include the form of contract provided under 
19subsection 8;
20B.  The commission shall accept bids for 30 calendar days beginning on or before 
21July 1, 2020 and review the bids based on the requirements under subsections 5, 6 
22and 7. The commission may select qualified bids in excess of 25 megawatts if the 
23commission determines that the incremental procurement is in the public interest.  If 
24the commission selects qualified bids in excess of 25 megawatts, the commission 
25shall reduce the quantity procured in subsequent block procurements.  If the 
26commission selects bids totaling less than 25 megawatts in the initial competitive 
27procurement, the quantity procured in subsequent block procurements must increase 
28by the difference between 25 megawatts and the number of megawatts submitted in 
29the initial competitive procurement. If pursuant to subsections 5 and 6 no bids are 
30accepted, the commission shall:
31(1)  Conduct a new initial competitive procurement under this subsection within 9 
32months; and
33(2)  Study the reasons for the inability of the procurement to secure the target 
34amount and submit a report of its findings and any recommended legislation to 
35the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
36matters;
37C.  The commission shall issue a public notice of the procurement results no later 
38than 30 calendar days after the bid acceptance period has ended. The public notice 
39must include the name, sponsor, size and location of each selected project and the 
40awarded contract price; and
Page 7 - 129LR1803(01)-11D.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with the selected project 
2or projects for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate equal to the clearing 
3price to be paid as a bill credit to the commercial or institutional customer. 
43.  Subsequent block contract rate procurements.   Subsequent to the initial 
5competitive procurement under subsection 2, the remaining procurement must proceed 
6pursuant to the following:
7A.  The commission shall procure 4 additional blocks of contracted distributed 
8generation resources to meet the overall procurement goal of subsection 1. Each 
9procurement block size equals 1/4 of the difference between 125 megawatts and the 
10quantity procured under subsection 2. These blocks are numbered sequentially, 
11starting with 2. Subsequent procurements are assigned to a particular block, starting 
12with procurement block 2 and finishing with procurement block 5;
13B.  The block contract rate for procurement block 2 must equal 97% of the clearing 
14price determined in subsection 2.  Each successive procurement block must have a 
15block contract rate equal to 97% of the preceding block;
16C.  Blocks 2 to 5 must be opened immediately following the initial competitive 
17procurement for bids qualifying under subsection 5;
18D.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with each qualified 
19project for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate equal to the block contract 
20rate of the procurement block then open and paid as a bill credit to the commercial or 
21institutional customer; and
22E.  Each contract awarded pursuant to this subsection reduces the available capacity 
23in a procurement block, with the earliest awards reducing the lowest numbered 
24procurement block that has remaining capacity. If an awarded contract exceeds the 
25remaining capacity of its procurement block, the contract rate is set at the block 
26contract rate for the block filled by this award and any overprocurement in one block 
27is subtracted from the quantity available in the next block. If a contract award 
28exceeds the capacity of procurement block 5, the entire quantity of the offer is 
29awarded at the block contract rate for procurement block 5 and no further contracts 
30may be awarded except under subsection 8.
314.  Failure to complete timely procurement.  If any procurement block remains 
32unfilled for more than 12 months from the time the previous block was filled:
33A.  The commission shall suspend procurements under subsection 3 pending 
34completion of the process described in this subsection;
35B.  The commission shall review and may amend the rules published under 
36subsection 2, paragraph A or the standard contract under subsection 8 for a new 
37competitive procurement of long-term contracts for the output of at least 25 
38megawatts of distributed generation resources as part of the procurement goal in 
39subsection 1. The commission shall publish any amendments and a new bid 
40acceptance period for not less than 6 months and not more than 9 months;
41C.  The commission shall accept bids for 30 calendar days from the date established 
42in paragraph B and review the bids based on the requirements set forth in subsections 
Page 8 - 129LR1803(01)-115, 6 and 7 and the published rules. The commission may select qualified bids in 
2excess of 25 megawatts if the commission determines that the incremental 
3procurement is in the public interest and the incremental procurement reduces the 
4quantity procured in subsequent procurements.
5D.  The commission shall issue a public notice of the procurement results no later 
6than 30 calendar days after the bid acceptance period has ended. The public notice 
7must include the name, sponsor, size and location of each selected project and the 
8awarded contract price;
9E.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with the selected project 
10or projects for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate equal to the highest 
11selected offer rate as adjusted under subsection 7 to be paid as a bill credit to the 
12commercial or institutional customer; 
13F.  The commission shall reopen procurements under subsection 3 unless no contracts 
14are awarded under paragraph E. The quantity procured under paragraph C must be 
15subtracted from the current procurement block and the block contract rate for that 
16procurement block must be set at the clearing price set under paragraph E.  The block 
17contract rate for each subsequent procurement block must be set at 97% of the newly 
18established rate for the preceding procurement block; and
19G.  If no contracts are awarded under paragraph E, the commission shall conduct 
20another competitive solicitation under this subsection with the bid acceptance period 
21to open approximately 12 months after the bid acceptance period determined in 
22paragraph B.  The commission shall also examine the reasons for the inability of the 
23procurement to secure the target amount and submit a report of its findings and any 
24recommended legislation to the joint standing committee of the legislature having 
25jurisdiction over energy matters.
265.  Bid or offer qualification.  The commission shall establish minimum 
27requirements for bids or offers in a solicitation under this section, including:
28A.  Demonstration of site control;
29B.  If a participating commercial or institutional customer is not the party making the 
30bid, an agreement from a customer that would receive bill credits under subsection 9;
31C.  A fully executed interconnection service agreement with an investor-owned 
32transmission and distribution utility;
33D.  A plan and schedule to obtain all required federal, state and local permits and 
34approvals for the project; and
35E.  The capacity to make a financial assurance deposit at the time a contract is signed.
36A photovoltaic project must employ qualified persons for the complete installation and 
37electrical maintenance of the distributed generation resource under standards required by 
38the Electricians' Examining Board under Title 32, section 1153-A.  A bid may not be 
39accepted for a distributed generation resource located on prime farmland as defined by 
40the United States Department of Agriculture and delineated by the Department of 
41Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.  The commission may by rule require a bidder to 
42pay a reasonable bidding fee to defray administrative costs.
Page 9 - 129LR1803(01)-116.  Ensuring competition.  Prior to each solicitation under subsections 2 to 4, the 
2commission shall establish standards to ensure that the solicitation has a sufficient 
3number of unique bidders and quantity of qualified bids to be determined competitive.  If 
4the commission concludes that a solicitation is not competitive, the commission may 
5reduce the target procurement quantities to the highest level, including zero, that may be 
6procured consistent with this subsection and shall defer to subsequent solicitations the 
7capacity reduced in the solicitation.
87.  Bid selection.  Following a review of bids received in the solicitations under 
9subsections 2 to 4, and after any adjustment to the target quantity under subsection 6, the 
10commission shall select one or more winning bids that, in the aggregate, meet the target 
11procurement quantity. If there are multiple qualified bids at the same offer rate, the 
12commission shall give preference to the qualified bid or bids that minimize the cost to the 
13standard buyers or, if there is no difference in cost, to the bid that was submitted first.
14In evaluating bids in a competitive solicitation, the commission shall evaluate a qualified 
15bid for a project that is located on previously developed or impacted land at 90% of the 
16offered rate. Previously developed or impacted land must include areas covered by 
17impervious surfaces, capped landfills or brownfield sites as defined by the Department of 
18Environmental Protection. If a bid under this subsection is accepted, the contract rate for 
19each accepted bid for a project located on previously developed or impacted land must be 
20paid a rate equal to the clearing price.
218.  Standard contract and milestones.  Prior to a solicitation, the commission shall 
22provide, in consultation with the standard buyer or standard buyers, a standard contract 
23that commits the standard buyer and a project sponsor to commercially reasonable 
24behavior and includes provisions including an interconnection fee list and interconnection 
25schedule to ensure that the project proceeds to commercial operation on a reasonable 
26timeline.  The standard contracts for all standard buyers must be substantially identical to 
27the extent commercially reasonable.
28A qualified project must be mechanically operable within 18 months of being awarded a 
29contract.  The commission may grant an extension for good cause. If a project fails to 
30meet a milestone, the project sponsor is in default and the sponsor's contract must be 
31cancelled. The capacity associated with a cancelled project must be added to the currently 
32open procurement block. If procurement block 5 has been filled and procurements closed, 
33the defaulted quantity must be added to procurement block 5 and new offers must be 
34accepted under subsection 3.
359.  Determination of bill credit.  The bill credit allocated to a commercial or 
36institutional customer must be based on the total kilowatt-hours of energy production of 
37the distributed generation resource for the previous month. For each billing month, the 
38value of the credit must be calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours by the 
39contract rate.  A payment to a commercial or institutional customer must be credited 
40against the customer's monthly electricity bill in accordance with section 3478.  The 
41monthly energy production must be determined by a revenue-grade meter installed and 
42paid for by the participating commercial or institutional customer.
Page 10 - 129LR1803(01)-1110.  Exemption.  A customer is not considered a public utility or competitive 
2electricity provider solely as a result of entering into a contract with a standard buyer 
3under this section.
411.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section by January 1, 
52020. Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
6chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
7§3477.  Large-scale shared resources procurement
81.  Procurement amounts.   By July 1, 2024, the commission shall procure 250 
9megawatts of the output of large-scale shared distributed generation resources by 
10conducting an initial competitive solicitation of 50 megawatts to establish market-based, 
11declining block contract rates to procure the remaining 200 megawatts.
122.  Initial competitive procurement. The following standards apply to the initial 
13competitive procurement of large-scale shared distributed generation resources:
14A.  On or before January 1, 2020, the commission shall publish rules for the 
15competitive solicitation of long-term contracts for the output of 50 megawatts of 
16large-scale shared distributed generation resources under subsection 1. The 
17publication must include the form of contract provided under subsection 8;
18B.  The commission shall accept bids for 30 calendar days, beginning on or before 
19July 1, 2020, and review the bids based on the requirements under subsections 5, 6 
20and 7. The commission may select qualified bids in excess of 50 megawatts if the 
21commission determines that the incremental procurement is in the public interest. If 
22the commission selects qualified bids in excess of 50 megawatts, the commission 
23shall reduce the quantity procured in subsequent block procurements.  If the 
24commission selects bids totaling less than 50 megawatts in the initial competitive 
25procurement, the quantity procured in subsequent block procurements must increase 
26by the difference between 50 megawatts and the number of megawatts submitted in 
27the initial competitive procurement. If pursuant to subsections 5 and 6 no bids are 
28accepted, the commission shall:
29(1)  Conduct a new initial competitive procurement under this subsection within 9 
30months; and 
31(2)  Study the reasons for the inability of the procurement to secure the target 
32amount and submit a report of its findings and any recommended legislation to 
33the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
34matters;
35C.  The commission shall issue a public notice of the procurement results no later 
36than 30 calendar days after the bid acceptance period has ended. The public notice 
37must include the name, sponsor, size and location of each selected project and the 
38awarded contract price; and
39D.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with the selected project 
40or projects for a term of 20 years at the clearing price to be paid as a bill credit to the 
41subscribers. 
Page 11 - 129LR1803(01)-113.  Subsequent block contract rate procurements.  Subsequent to the procurement 
2of capacity under subsection 2, the remaining procurement must proceed pursuant to the 
3following:
4A.  The commission shall procure 4 additional blocks of contracted distributed 
5generation resources to meet the overall procurement goal of subsection 1. Each 
6procurement block size equals 1/4 of the difference between 250 megawatts and the 
7quantity procured under subsection 2. These blocks are numbered sequentially, 
8starting with 2. Subsequent procurements are assigned to a particular block, starting 
9with procurement block 2 and finishing with procurement block 5;
10B.  The block contract rate for procurement block 2 must equal 97% of the clearing 
11price determined in subsection 2. Each successive procurement block must have a 
12block contract rate equal to 97% of the preceding block;
13C.  Blocks 2 to 5 must be open immediately following the initial competitive 
14procurement for bids qualifying under subsection 5;
15D.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with each qualified 
16project for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate equal to the block contract 
17rate of the procurement block then open and paid as a bill credit to the subscribers; 
18and
19E.  Each contract awarded pursuant to this subsection reduces the available capacity 
20in a procurement block, with the earliest awards reducing the lowest numbered 
21procurement block that has remaining capacity. If an awarded contract exceeds the 
22remaining capacity of its procurement block, the contract rate is set at the block 
23contract rate for the block filled by this award and any overprocurement in one block 
24is subtracted from the quantity available in the next block. If a contract award 
25exceeds the capacity of procurement block 5, the entire quantity of the offer is 
26awarded at the block contract rate for procurement block 5 and no further contracts 
27may be awarded except under subsection 8.
284.  Failure to complete timely procurement.  If any procurement block remains 
29unfilled for more than 12 months from the time the previous block was filled:
30A.  The commission shall suspend procurements under subsection 3 pending 
31completion of the process described in this subsection;
32B.  The commission shall review and may amend the rules published under 
33subsection 2, paragraph A or the standard contract under subsection 8 for a new 
34competitive procurement of long-term contracts for the output of at least 50 
35megawatts of large-scale shared distributed generation resources as part of the 
36procurement goal in subsection 1. The commission shall publish any amendments 
37and a new bid acceptance period in not less than 6 months and not more than 9 
38months;
39C.  The commission shall accept bids for 30 calendar days from the date established 
40and review the bids based on the requirements set forth in subsections 5, 6 and 7 and 
41the published rules. The commission may select qualified bids in excess of 50 
42megawatts if the commission determines that the incremental procurement is in the 
Page 12 - 129LR1803(01)-11public interest and the incremental procurement reduces the quantity procured in 
2subsequent procurements;
3D.  The commission shall issue a public notice of the procurement results no later 
4than 30 calendar days after the bid acceptance period has ended. The public notice 
5must include the name, sponsor, size and location of each selected project and the 
6awarded contract price;
7E.  The applicable standard buyer shall enter into a contract with the selected project 
8or projects for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate equal to the highest 
9selected bid rate as adjusted under subsection 7 to be paid as a bill credit to a 
10subscriber;
11F.  The commission shall reopen procurements under subsection 3 unless no contracts 
12are awarded under paragraph E.  The quantity procured under paragraph C must be 
13subtracted from the current procurement block and the block contract rate for that 
14procurement block must be set at the clearing price set under paragraph E.  The block 
15contract rate for each subsequent procurement block must be set at 97% of the newly 
16established rate for the preceding procurement block; and
17G.  If no contracts are awarded under paragraph E, the commission shall conduct 
18another competitive solicitation under this subsection with the bid acceptance period 
19to open approximately 12 months after the bid acceptance period determined in 
20paragraph B.  The commission shall also examine the reasons for the inability of the 
21procurement to secure the target amount and submit a report of its findings and any 
22recommended legislation to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
23jurisdiction over energy matters.
245.  Bid qualification.  The commission shall establish minimum requirements for 
25bids in a solicitation under this section, including:
26A.  Demonstration of site control;
27B.  Demonstration of experience fulfilling the obligation to subscribers of shared 
28distributed generation resources;
29C.  A fully executed interconnection service agreement with an investor-owned 
30transmission and distribution utility;
31D.  A plan and schedule to obtain all required federal, state and local permits and 
32approvals for the project; and
33E.  The capacity to make a financial assurance deposit at the time a contract is signed.
34A photovoltaic project must employ qualified persons for the complete installation and 
35electrical maintenance of the distributed generation resource under standards required by 
36the Electricians' Examining Board under Title 32, section 1153-A. A bid may not be 
37accepted for a distributed generation resource located on prime farmland as defined by 
38the United States Department of Agriculture and delineated by the Department of 
39Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.  The commission may by rule require a bidder to 
40pay a reasonable bidding fee to defray administrative costs.
Page 13 - 129LR1803(01)-116.  Ensuring competition.  Prior to each solicitation under subsections 2 to 4, the 
2commission shall establish standards to ensure that the solicitation has a sufficient 
3number of unique bidders and quantity of qualified bids to be determined competitive. If 
4the commission concludes that a solicitation is not competitive, the commission may 
5reduce the target procurement quantities to the highest level, including zero, that may be 
6procured consistent with this subsection and shall defer to subsequent solicitations the 
7capacity reduced in that solicitation.
87.  Bid selection. Following a review of bids received in the solicitations under 
9subsections 2 to 4, and after any adjustment to the target quantity under subsection 6, the 
10commission shall select one or more winning bids that, in the aggregate, meet the target 
11procurement quantity. If there are multiple qualified bids at the same bid rate, the 
12commission shall give preference to the qualified bid or bids that minimize the cost to the 
13standard buyers or, if there is no difference in cost, to the bid that was submitted first.
14In evaluating bids in a competitive solicitation, the commission shall evaluate a qualified 
15bid for a project that is located on previously developed or impacted land at 90% of the 
16bid rate. Previously developed or impacted land must include areas covered by 
17impervious surfaces, capped landfills or brownfield sites as defined by the Department of 
18Environmental Protection. If a bid under this subsection is accepted, the contract rate for 
19each accepted bid for a project located on previously developed or impacted land must be 
20paid a rate equal the clearing price.
218.  Standard contract and milestones.  Prior to a solicitation, the commission shall 
22provide, in consultation with the standard buyer or standard buyers, a standard contract 
23that commits the standard buyer and a project sponsor to commercially reasonable 
24behavior and includes provisions including an interconnection fee list and interconnection 
25schedule to ensure that the project proceeds to commercial operation on a reasonable 
26timeline. The standard contracts for all standard buyers must be substantially identical to 
27the extent commercially reasonable.
28A qualified project must be mechanically operable within 18 months of being awarded a 
29contract. The commission may grant an extension for good cause. If a project fails to 
30meet a milestone, the project sponsor is in default and the sponsor's contract must be 
31cancelled. The capacity associated with a cancelled project must be added to the currently 
32open procurement block. If procurement block 5 has been filled and procurements closed, 
33the defaulted quantity must be added to procurement block 5 and new offers must be 
34accepted under subsection 3.
359.  Payment and minimum subscription.  The project sponsor and subscribers must 
36receive the contract rate for the output of a large-scale shared distributed generation 
37resource that is fully subscribed. For any portion not subscribed, the project sponsor must 
38receive the wholesale rate. Requirements for minimum subscriptions include:
39A.  At least 50% of the total nameplate capacity of a large-scale shared distributed 
40generation resource must be subscribed by subscriptions of 25 kilowatts or less or at 
41least 20% of the total nameplate capacity must be subscribed by subscriptions of 25 
42kilowatts or less if subscriptions from a municipality or units of municipal 
43government account for more than 30% of the total nameplate capacity, unless 
44subscriptions from a municipality or units of municipal government account for more 
Page 14 - 129LR1803(01)-11than 50% of the total nameplate capacity of a large-scale shared distributed 
2generation resource; and
3B.  At least:
4(1)  Ten percent of the total nameplate capacity of a large-scale shared distributed 
5generation resource must be subscribed by households with low or moderate 
6income or by organizations serving low or moderate income households if the 
7subscriptions serve to directly reduce the electricity costs for low or moderate 
8income households; or 
9(2)  If a municipality or unit of municipal government accounts for more than 
1050% of the subscriptions to a large-scale shared distributed generation resource, 
115% of the total nameplate capacity of the large-scale shared distributed 
12generation resource must be subscribed by households with low or moderate 
13income or by organizations serving low or moderate income households if the 
14subscriptions serve to directly reduce the electricity costs for low or moderate 
15income households. 
16Subscriptions from municipalities or units of municipal government may not account for 
17more than 70% of the nameplate capacity of a large-scale shared distributed generation 
18resource. For the purposes of this subsection, "low or moderate income" means up to 80% 
19the median income for the county or metropolitan area as determined by the Maine State 
20Housing Authority.
2110.  Determination of subscriber bill credit. The bill credit allocated to each 
22subscriber from a large-scale shared distributed generation resource must be based on the 
23subscriber's percentage interest of the total production of the large-scale shared 
24distributed generation resource for the previous month. For each billing month, the value 
25of the credit allocated to a subscriber must be calculated by multiplying the number of 
26kilowatt-hours constituting the subscriber's share by the contract rate. On a monthly basis, 
27the project sponsor shall provide to the investor-owned transmission and distribution 
28utility in a standardized and electronic format a list of subscribers and subscriber 
29information required to calculate the bill credit to be provided to each subscriber. A credit 
30to a subscriber must be applied against the subscriber's monthly electricity bill in 
31accordance with section 3478 no later than one billing month following the month during 
32which the energy was generated by the large-scale shared distributed generation resource. 
33The investor-owned transmission and distribution utility shall provide a monthly record 
34to the project sponsor of the credit applied to a subscriber within a month after the credits 
35are applied to the subscriber's bill.
36The monthly output available for allocation as subscribed or unsubscribed energy must be 
37determined by a revenue-grade meter installed and paid for by the project sponsor.
3811.  Exemption. A project sponsor or subscriber is not considered a public utility or 
39competitive electricity provider solely as a result of the project sponsor's or subscriber's 
40interest or participation in a large-scale shared distributed generation resource. 
4112.  Renewable energy credits. Prior to a project sponsor's entering into a contract 
42with a subscriber under this section, the commission shall provide to the sponsor a 
43standard disclosure to be distributed by the sponsor to all participating subscribers that 
Page 15 - 129LR1803(01)-11describes the effect of selling the renewable attributes of exported electricity to the 
2standard buyer and explains how a subscriber may participate in the voluntary renewable 
3energy credit market. The commission shall establish a mechanism to allow a subscriber 
4with a share of less than 25 kilowatts to purchase renewable energy credits up to the 
5amount and of a substantially equivalent type to that the subscriber has sold to the 
6standard buyer at a price equal to 80% of market value.
713.  Consumer protection.  The commission shall establish by rule consumer 
8protection standards to protect subscribers from fraud and other unfair and deceptive 
9business practices. The commission may impose administrative penalties under chapter 
1015 upon a project sponsor and may order restitution for any party injured by a violation 
11for which a penalty may be assessed pursuant to chapter 15.
12The commission through its own counsel or through the Attorney General may apply to 
13the Superior Court of any county of the State to enforce any lawful order made or action 
14taken by the commission pursuant to this subsection and the court may issue any 
15preliminary or final order that the court determines proper.
1614.  Disclosures.  Prior to the sale or resale of a subscription in a large-scale shared 
17distributed generation resource or proposed large-scale shared distributed generation 
18resource, a project sponsor selling or reselling the subscription shall provide a disclosure 
19to potential subscribers that includes the following:
20A.  A good faith estimate of the annual kilowatt-hours to be delivered by the large-
21scale shared distributed generation resource based on the size of the subscriber's 
22interest;
23B.  A plain language explanation of the terms under which the bill credit under 
24section 3478 will be calculated;
25C.  A plain language explanation of the contract provisions regulating the disposition 
26or transfer of the subscription; and
27D.  A plain language explanation of the costs and benefits to the potential subscriber, 
28based on the subscriber's current usage and applicable tariff under section 3209-B for 
29the term of the proposed contract.
30The commission may establish a standard disclosure to be provided to potential 
31subscribers by a project sponsor to disclose the information under this subsection and 
32other information as the commission determines necessary to protect the interests of 
33potential subscribers.
3415.  Transfer of subscriptions. A subscriber may transfer or assign a subscription to 
35the associated project sponsor or to any person or entity that qualifies to be a subscriber in 
36the large-scale shared distributed generation resource. A project sponsor must provide a 
37process for assignment or transfer of a subscription. A project sponsor may not impose 
38transfer fees on a subscriber that moves to a different location within the same utility 
39service territory.
4016.  Project sponsor report.  One year after commercial operation of a large-scale 
41shared distributed generation resource commences, the project sponsor must submit to the 
Page 16 - 129LR1803(01)-11commission a report detailing compliance with this subsection and subsections 10, 12, 14 
2and 15.
317.  Rules. By January 1, 2020, the commission shall adopt rules to implement this 
4section. Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 
55, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
6§3478.  Bill credits; utility costs paid by project sponsor
71.  Credit assigned to a customer's bill.  If the value of a credit to be applied to a 
8customer's bill under this chapter is less than the amount owed by the customer at the end 
9of the applicable billing period, the customer must be billed for the difference between 
10the amount shown on the bill and the value of the available credit. If the value of the 
11credit to be applied to a customer's bill under this chapter is greater than the amount owed 
12by the customer at the end of the billing period, the remaining value of the credit must 
13carry over from month to month.
142.  Utility costs paid by project sponsor.  If a project sponsor pays an investor-
15owned transmission and distribution utility's costs associated with billing and collection 
16from a subscriber, at the request of the project sponsor the utility shall bill the subscriber 
17on behalf of the project sponsor.  Costs under this subsection are subject to review by the 
18commission.
193.  Rules. The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted 
20under this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
212-A.
22Sec. A-8.  Reports.  By December 1, 2021, the Public Utilities Commission shall 
23provide a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
24over energy matters on the status of metering and billing system capabilities for investor-
25owned transmission and distribution utilities in the State. The report must include 
26capabilities of systems to reliably offer time-differentiated rates for delivery and supply 
27of energy; the commission's level of confidence in metering and billing systems to 
28provide accurate information to utilities, consumers and the commission; the capacity of 
29systems to accommodate rates for bidirectional flow of power for customers with 
30distributed energy resources; and the degree to which systems are being used to achieve 
31the smart grid policy goals under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3143. 
32The commission shall report on any changes to rates or rules or other changes the 
33commission intends to adopt to increase the effectiveness of systems under this paragraph 
34and may make recommendations to the joint standing committee.
35The joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
36matters may report out legislation based on any recommendations under this section to 
37the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.
38Sec. A-9.  Evaluation.  The Public Utilities Commission shall evaluate net energy 
39billing under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A, when the total 
40amount of generation capacity involved in net energy billing in the State reaches 8% of 
41the total maximum load of transmission and distribution utilities in the State. The 
Page 17 - 129LR1803(01)-11commission shall evaluate the effectiveness of net energy billing in achieving state policy 
2goals and providing benefits to ratepayers and submit a report to the joint standing 
3committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters with its findings. 
4The joint standing committee may report out legislation based on the recommendations.
5PART B
6Sec. B-1.  Competitive solicitation; solar energy projects; long-term 
7contracts.
81.  By October 1, 2019, in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, 
9section 3210-C, except as otherwise provided by this section, the Public Utilities 
10Commission shall conduct one or more competitive solicitations for proposals for a long-
11term contract to supply installed capacity and associated renewable energy and renewable 
12energy credits from one or more solar energy projects. Subject to the requirements of this 
13section, the commission shall direct one or more transmission and distribution utilities to 
14execute a long-term contract of up to 20 years for the installed capacity and associated 
15renewable energy and renewable energy credits of one or more solar energy projects. For 
16purposes of this section, "solar energy project" means a solar photovoltaic generation 
17facility that is connected to the electrical transmission and distribution system located in 
18the State.
192. Following a review of proposals submitted in response to a competitive solicitation 
20under subsection 1, the commission shall negotiate with one or more potential suppliers 
21to supply no less than an aggregate total of 100 megawatts and no more than an aggregate 
22total of 400 megawatts of installed capacity and associated renewable energy and 
23renewable energy credits from one or more solar energy projects. The commission may 
24direct one or more transmission and distribution utilities to execute a long-term contract 
25with a supplier under this subsection if the commission determines that:
26A. The potential supplier proposes the sale of renewable energy produced by a solar 
27energy project;
28B. The potential supplier has the technical and financial capacity to develop, 
29construct, operate and, to the extent consistent with applicable federal law, 
30decommission and remove the solar energy project;
31C. The solar energy project will be constructed and operating within 5 years of the 
32date the contract is executed, unless the commission and supplier negotiate a longer 
33time period; and
34D. The proposed contract:
35(1) Represents the lowest-cost means of procuring solar energy;
36(2) Will provide benefits to ratepayers that exceed the proposed costs to 
37ratepayers; and 
38(3) Provides for a nominal levelized cost that is not greater than 3.5 cents per 
39kilowatt-hour over the term of the contract. For purposes of this paragraph, 
40"levelized cost" means an economic assessment of the cost of an energy-
41generating system including all the costs over its lifetime: initial investment, 
Page 18 - 129LR1803(01)-11operations and maintenance, fuel and capital measured at current value without 
2adjusting for inflation.
33. If, following a competitive solicitation under subsection 1, the commission directs 
4the execution of one or more contracts for an aggregate amount of capacity that is less 
5than 400 megawatts, the commission shall conduct one or more further competitive 
6solicitations pursuant to subsection 1 no less than every 24 months, unless the 
7commission determines that a longer period of time between solicitations is likely to 
8result in substantially lower contract prices.  If the commission determines that the likely 
9benefits to ratepayers resulting from a contract executed under the solicitation process 
10will exceed the likely costs, the commission shall continue the solicitations until the 
11aggregate amount of capacity contracted pursuant to this subsection reaches 400 
12megawatts.
134. To mitigate any adverse impacts on electric rates of a long-term contract executed 
14under this section, the commission shall require the supplier, as part of the long-term 
15contract, to take advantage of future federal support that may become available to the 
16supplier’s project over the contract term.
175.  The commission may approve only long-term contracts under this section that in 
18the aggregate would result in an increase in electric rates no larger than the amount of the 
19assessment charged under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 10110, 
20subsection 4-A at the time that the contract is executed. The commission may assess to a 
21rate class associated with a contract only costs in an amount consistent with Title 35-A, 
22section 10110, subsection 4-A.
236.  The commission may adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section.  Rules 
24adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined by the Maine 
25Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
26Sec. B-2.  Reporting; review of terms and conditions for long-term 
27contracts for solar energy. By January 1, 2020 and by every January 1st of 
28subsequent years in which a contract under this Part is in effect, the commission shall 
29submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
30energy matters on the procurement of transmission capacity, capacity resources, energy 
31and renewable energy credits under section 1 in the preceding 12 months. The report 
32must contain information, including, but not limited to, the number of requests for 
33proposals by the commission for long-term contracts, the number of responses to requests 
34for proposals pursuant to which a contract has been finalized, the number of executed 
35term sheets or contracts resulting from the requests for proposals, the commission's initial 
36estimates of ratepayer costs or savings associated with any approved term sheet, actual 
37ratepayer costs or savings for the previous year associated with any procurement, the total 
38ratepayer costs or savings at the time of the report and the megawatt-hours, renewable 
39energy credits or capacity produced or procured through contracts. The report must also 
40include a plan for any subsequent procurement of capacity resources, energy and 
41renewable energy credits under this Part, including dates for requests for proposals, and 
42types of resources to be procured.
