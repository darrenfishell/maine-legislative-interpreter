4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.

6the laws governing shoreland zoning to increase the vegetative buffer requirement from 
775 feet to 150 feet for certain areas in the shoreland zone.  The bill also proposes to 
8remove provisions in law that grandfather certain parcels of land and that allow smaller
