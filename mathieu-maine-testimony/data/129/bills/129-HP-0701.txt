In House__________
ORDERED, the Senate concurring, that the Joint Standing Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs shall review the requirement that the State provide 55% of the cost of the total 
allocation for kindergarten to grade 12 education from General Fund revenue sources, as required 
by Initiated Bill 2003, chapter 2, "An Act To Enact the School Finance and Tax Reform Act of 
2003," which was subsequently amended to reduce the State's share of required funding.  In 
conducting the review, the committee shall invite the participation of interested parties, such as 
the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, superintendents of school 
administrative units and representatives of municipalities and regional service centers, such as 
town or city managers.  The committee shall evaluate the problems the State has had historically 
meeting the 55% requirement and, with input from the interested parties, determine methods of 
providing a more stable and certain source of funding to allow the State to meet the 55% 
requirement.  The committee shall report out a bill to the Second Regular Session of the 129th 
Legislature no later than January 15, 2020 implementing its findings and recommendations.
