14SUMMARY
15This bill clarifies a lobbyist's reporting requirement for expenditures totaling over 
16$300 in a calendar month made to or on behalf of covered officials when the expenditures 
17are made by the lobbyist, a lobbyist associate or a lobbying firm without reimbursement 
18from an employer of the lobbyist.  When a lobbyist, lobbyist associate or lobbying firm 
19makes such expenditures and does not receive or anticipate receiving reimbursement 
20from an employer, the bill requires the lobbyist to file a separate report disclosing the 
21expenditure.  The bill defines "lobbying firm."
22The bill changes registration requirements for state employees who lobby on behalf 
23of a state department or agency.  Under the current law, a department or agency is 
24required to file a separate registration for each employee who lobbies or monitors 
25legislation more than 20 hours in a legislative session.  The bill requires a department or 
26agency to file a single registration listing all employees designated by the department or 
27agency to lobby or who are anticipated to lobby more than 10 hours during a legislative 
28session.
29The bill makes minor changes to clarify what information must be included in 
30lobbyist registrations and monthly reports.
31The bill expands the requirement to attend and complete an annual harassment 
32training to include lobbyist associates.
33The bill provides an effective date of December 1, 2020.
