Page 4 - 129LR1531(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill repeals the law authorizing the creation of a new birth certificate for an 
3adopted person and it removes the provision that requires the sealing of the original birth 
4certificate.  The bill allows a person born in this State to retain that person's original birth 
5certificate, even if that person is adopted.  This change does not affect a person born in a 
6foreign country who is adopted in this State.  A person adopted before October 1, 2019 
7will still need to follow the current statutory procedure to receive access to that person's 
8original birth certificate upon attaining 18 years of age.  This bill requires a certificate of 
9birth for a child who is being adopted to be amended to include the adoptee's new name 
10and the adoptive parent's name or parents' names and personal data.
