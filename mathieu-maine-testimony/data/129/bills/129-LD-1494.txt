19energy input to the facility.
20For purposes of this paragraph, the term "useful power output" means the electrical or 
21mechanical energy made available for use, exclusive of any energy used in the power 
22production process.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term "useful thermal energy" 
23means thermal heat energy made available to an industrial or commercial process, net 
24of any heat contained in condensate return and makeup water, used in a heating 
25application or used in a space cooling application.

25may not be used to satisfy the requirements of subsection 3.
26B.  Suspensions of scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements as provided in 
27paragraph A are governed by this paragraph.
28(1)  If by March 31st of the years 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 the commission 
29determines that investment in new renewable capacity resources in the preceding 
302 calendar years has not been sufficient for competitive electricity providers to 
31meet the portfolio requirements under paragraph A and that the resulting use of 
32renewable energy credits pursuant to subsection 8 or the alternative compliance 
33payment mechanism pursuant to subsection 9, or both of these methods, has 
34burdened electricity customers in the State without providing the benefits of new 
35renewable capacity resources, the commission may suspend all or some of the 
36future scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements under paragraph A.
37(2)  If the commission finds that alternative compliance payments are made 
38pursuant to subsection 9 in 3 consecutive calendar years, the commission shall 
39temporarily suspend all or some of the future scheduled increases in the portfolio 
40requirements under paragraph A.
Page 6 - 129LR1616(01)-11(3)  If the commission suspends any scheduled increases in the portfolio 
2requirements under paragraph A pursuant to subparagraph (1) or (2), the 
3commission may resume increases, limited to no more than one percentage point 
4per year over the previous year, in the portfolio requirements after a minimum of 
5one year.
6C.  No later than March 31, 2008 and annually thereafter, the commission shall 
7submit a report regarding the status of new renewable capacity resources in the State 
8and compliance with the portfolio requirements under paragraph A to the joint 
9standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy 
10matters. The report must include, but is not limited to, a description of new renewable 
11capacity resources available to meet the portfolio requirements under paragraph A, 
12documentation of the loss of any existing renewable generation capacity in the State, 
13the status of implementation of the new renewable capacity resources portfolio 
14requirements under paragraph A, including any suspensions pursuant to paragraph B, 
15and recommendations to stimulate investment in new renewable capacity resources.  
16If the commission has reliable information about benefits and costs of the portfolio 
17requirements under paragraph A, over both the short and long terms with respect to 
18the State's economy, environmental quality or electricity consumers, the commission 
19shall include that information in the report.
20D.  Retail electricity sales pursuant to a supply contract or standard-offer service 
21arrangement executed by a competitive electricity provider that is in effect on the 
22effective date of this subsection is exempt from the requirements of this subsection 
23until the end date of the current term of the supply contract or standard-offer service 
24arrangement.
25The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted under this 
26subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
273-B.  Portfolio requirements; thermal renewable energy credits.  Each 
28competitive electricity provider must, in addition to meeting the other portfolio 
29requirements of subsections 3 and 3-A, demonstrate in a manner satisfactory to the 
30commission that it has purchased thermal renewable energy credits in an amount at least 
31equal to the following percentages of its portfolio of supply sources for retail electricity

3development of a market for tradable credits for satisfying eligible resource requirements, 
4the commission shall review the 30% portfolio requirement and make a recommendation 
5for any change to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
6utilities and energy matters no later than 5 years after the beginning of retail competition.
77.  Information.  To the extent that funding is available, the commission shall inform 
8electricity consumers in this State of the benefits of electricity generated in this State 
9using renewable resources and of the opportunities available in this State to purchase 
10electricity that is generated using those resources, including, but not limited to, the green 
11power offer and other green power supply products and renewable energy credit products 
12certified under section 3212-A.  The commission may not promote any renewable 
13resources over others.  The commission may apply for, receive and expend grant money 
14from the United States Department of Energy and other government agencies for this 
15purpose.   The commission may create or cause to be created a brand or logo to identify 
16Maine renewable resources, including the green power offer and other green power 
17supply products and renewable energy credit products certified under section 3212-A, to 
18consumers.  The commission shall register any mark or logo created pursuant to this 
19subsection with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in accordance with 
20Title 10, chapter 301-A, or both.  Any brand or logo created pursuant to this subsection

22commission.
238.  Credit trading.  The commission shall allow competitive electricity providers to 
24satisfy the portfolio requirements of subsections 3 and 3-A through the use of renewable 
25energy credits if the commission determines that a reliable system of electrical attribute 
26trading exists. When renewable energy credits are used to satisfy the portfolio 
27requirements of subsections 3 and 3-A, the value of a renewable energy credit for 
28electricity generated by a community-based renewable energy project, as defined in 
29section 3602, that is participating in the community-based renewable energy pilot 
30program established in section 3603 and elects the renewable energy credit multiplier 
31under section 3605 is 150% of the amount of the electricity.
329.  Alternative compliance payment; portfolio requirements for new renewable 
33capacity resources.  The commission shall allow competitive electricity providers to 
34satisfy the portfolio requirements for new renewable capacity resources under subsection 
353-A through an alternative compliance payment mechanism in accordance with this 
36subsection.
37A.  The commission shall set the alternative compliance payment rate by rule and 
38shall publish the alternative compliance payment rate by January 31st of each year. In 
39setting the rate, the commission shall take into account prevailing market prices, 
40standard-offer service prices for electricity, reliance on alternative compliance 
41payments to meet the requirements of subsection 3-A and investment in new 
42renewable capacity resources in the State during the previous calendar year.
Page 8 - 129LR1616(01)-11B.  The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments made by 
2competitive electricity providers and shall deposit all funds collected under this 
3paragraph in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund established under 
4section 10121, subsection 2 to be used to fund research, development and 
5demonstration projects relating to renewable energy technologies and to fund rebates 
6for cost-effective renewable energy technologies.
7The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted under this 
8subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
9Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3210-G is enacted to read:
10§3210-G.  Renewable portfolio standard procurement
11The commission shall direct investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to 
12enter into one or more contracts for energy or renewable energy credits from new 
13renewable capacity resources in accordance with this section.  For purposes of this 
14section, "new renewable capacity resource" and "renewable energy credit" have the same 
15meanings as in section 3210.
161.  Competitive procurement.  The commission shall conduct competitive 
17solicitations in order to choose new renewable capacity resources for contracts under this 
18section.
19A.  Beginning in 2019, the commission shall conduct competitive solicitations under 
20this section for an amount of energy or renewable energy credits from new renewable 
21capacity resources in each calendar year that is at least equal to 1/2 of the total 
22portfolio of new renewable capacity resources required in that year under section 
233210, subsection 3-A, as determined by the commission.
24B.  To the extent sufficient resources are available, 75% of the energy or renewable 
25energy credits contracted under this section must come from new renewable capacity 
26resources that begin commercial operations after June 30, 2019 and 25% must come 
27from new renewable capacity resources that began commercial operations on or prior 
28to June 30, 2019.  The first competitive solicitation for energy or renewable energy 
29credits from new renewable capacity resources that began commercial operations on 
30or prior to June 30, 2019 must occur within 3 months of the effective date of this 
31paragraph.  Competitive solicitations for energy or renewable energy credits from 
32new renewable capacity resources that begin commercial operations after June 30, 
332019 must occur at least 3 times before January 1, 2024, unless the 75% requirement 
34under this paragraph is met through fewer solicitations.
35C.  In conducting a solicitation and choosing new renewable capacity resources for 
36contracts under this section, the commission shall weigh for each new renewable 
37capacity resource the benefits to ratepayers and the benefits to the State's economy as 
38follows:
39(1)  A weight of 70% must be given to the benefits to ratepayers; and
40(2)  A weight of 30% must be given to benefits to the economy, which may 
41include, but are not limited to:
Page 9 - 129LR1616(01)-11(a)  Capital investments by the new renewable capacity resource to improve 
2long-term viability of an existing facility;
3(b)  Payments by the new renewable capacity resource for the harvest of 
4wood fuel;
5(c)  Employment resulting from the new renewable capacity resource;
6(d)  Payments by the new renewable capacity resource to a host community, 
7whether or not required by law or rule;
8(e)  Excise, income, property and sales taxes paid by the new renewable 
9capacity resource;
10(f)  Purchases of goods and services by the new renewable capacity resource; 
11and
12(g)  Avoided emissions resulting from the operation of the new renewable 
13capacity resource.
142.  Contract terms.  A contract entered into pursuant to this section must be for a 
15term of 20 years, unless the commission finds a contract for a longer term to be prudent.  
16If a new renewable capacity resource offers to sell capacity, the commission may allow a 
17contract with that resource to include the purchase of such capacity, but the commission 
18may not require any new renewable capacity resource to offer or sell capacity in order to 
19participate in any solicitation or contract under this section.
203.  Report.  No later than March 31, 2023 and biennially thereafter, the commission 
21shall submit a report regarding the status of contracts for new renewable capacity 
22resources under this section to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
23jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters. The report must include, but is not limited 
24to, a description of new renewable capacity resources participating in competitive 
25solicitations, information about the resources selected for contracts and the selection 
26process, the benefits and costs of the contracts and recommendations about how to further 
27stimulate investment in new renewable capacity resources or achieve ratepayer benefits 
28from new renewable capacity resources.  The report may include information about 
29benefits and costs of the contracts to the State's economy, environmental quality or 
30electricity consumers over both the short and long terms.  Any analysis of the benefits or 
31costs of the contracts must be based on a forecast of all avoided costs resulting from the 
32contracts that is transparent and balanced over the long term.
33SUMMARY
34This bill increases the percentage of supply sources for retail electricity sales in the 
35State that must be accounted for by new renewable capacity resources from 10% to 50% 
36by 2030.  It also makes several changes to resource eligibility to meet these requirements.   
37The bill also creates a renewable portfolio standard for thermal energy resources.
38The bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission to procure long-term contracts 
39for an amount of renewable capacity resources that is equal to 1/2 the amount of the 
Page 10 - 129LR1616(01)-11portfolio requirements for these resources.  The bill requires the commission to conduct 
2annual competitive solicitations for the long-term contracts.
