A. A report required by this subsection must be filed with the commission according 
to a reporting schedule that the commission shall establish by rule that takes into 
consideration existing campaign finance reporting requirements. Rules adopted 
pursuant to this paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 
375, subchapter 2-A. 
B. A report required by this subsection must contain an itemized account of each 
expenditure in excess of $250 in any one candidate's election, the date and purpose of

under oath or affirmation whether the expenditure is made in cooperation, 
consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, the candidate or an

persons who lack access to the required technology or the technological ability to file 
reports electronically. The commission may adopt procedures allowing for the 
signed statement to be provisionally filed by facsimile or electronic mail, as long as

primary election, within 35 days before a special election or between Labor Day and the 
date of a general election, the telephone calls must include information disclosing both 
the name of the person who paid for or financed the telephone call and whether the 
candidate authorized the telephone call. The amendment clarifies that surveys that meet 
generally accepted standards for polling research and that are not conducted for the 
purpose of influencing the voting position of call recipients are not required to include 
these disclosures. 
2. Under the bill, when a person makes an expenditure exceeding $500 that expressly 
advocates for or against an initiative or referendum on the ballot through prerecorded 
automated telephone calls or scripted live telephone calls, the telephone calls must clearly 
state the name of the person who made or financed the telephone calls. The amendment 
clarifies that surveys that meet generally accepted standards for polling research and that 
are not conducted for the purpose of influencing the voting position of call recipients are 
not required to include this disclosure. 
3. It strikes the provision of the bill authorizing a traditionally financed candidate to 
expend surplus campaign funds on expenses related to a recount. 
4. The bill eliminates the requirement in current law that municipal, district and 
county party committees submit a campaign finance report within 24 hours of receiving a 
single contribution of $5,000 or more or making any expenditure of $1,000 or more, if 
that contribution or expenditure is made within the 13 days before a primary election. 
The amendment clarifies that these so-called 24-hour reports continue to be required 
when a municipal, district or county party committee receives a single contribution of 
$5,000 or more or makes an expenditure of $1,000 or more within the 13 days before a 
special election. 
5. It removes the provisions of the bill authorizing the Commission on Governmental 
Ethics and Election Practices to investigate whether a candidate certified as a Maine 
Clean Election Act candidate meets the qualifications for candidacy and for holding 
office set forth in the Constitution of Maine. 
6. It makes technical changes to the terminology used in several provisions of the 
campaign finance laws included in the bill.
