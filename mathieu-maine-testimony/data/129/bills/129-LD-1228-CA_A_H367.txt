Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The resolve requires the Department of Health and Human services to examine the Medicare Savings Program letters 
for clarity and usefulness and to look into the possibility of a letter that includes a tear off or cut out section for use as 
proof of benefit. It is possible that using a tear off form would cost the department more than the current letter format. 
This bill provides no new funding. The impact of this potential new unfunded cost on other programs in the DHHS 
cannot be determined at this time.
