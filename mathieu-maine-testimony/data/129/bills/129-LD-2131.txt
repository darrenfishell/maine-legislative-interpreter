position on the substance of the bill  and by reporting this bill out the committee is not 35 
suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with any aspect of 36 
this bill.  The committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of obtaining a 37 
printed bill that can be r eferred to the committee for a public hearing and subsequent 38 
committee action in the normal course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure 39 
clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the proposal.  40 
 
 Page 103 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 The bill changes the headnote of the Main e Revised Statutes, Title 17, section 1 
2003 -A to clarify that this section of law prohibits public drinking.  2 
The bill also makes a number of changes to Title 28 -A, the State's liquor laws, to 3 
standardize the language used in those laws, to correct errors, c onflicts, ambiguities, 4 
omissions and inconsistencies in those laws and to revise those laws, including by making 5 
the following changes.  6 
1.  It makes a number of changes to address ambiguities, inconsistencies and conflicts 7 
in the laws governing certificate s of approval, including the following.  8 
A.  It restructures the definition of "certificate of approval holder," a term that 9 
includes persons with certificates of approval as well as persons with in -state 10 
manufacturing licenses, to add clarity and ensures t he defined term is used correctly 11 
throughout the Title.  12 
B.  It resolves a conflict in the law by removing in -state manufacturers, that receive 13 
licenses, from a provision requiring persons engaged in certain activities to obtain 14 
certificates of approval.  15 
C.  It changes from a certificate of approval to a license the type of authority that a 16 
person that operates a special warehouse storage facility must obtain because the laws 17 
specific to certificate of approval holders generally do not apply to special wareh ouse 18 
storage facilities.  It further clarifies which laws are applicable to licensed special 19 
warehouse storage facilities.  20 
D.  It removes ambiguities by clarifying which of the general qualification and 21 
application requirements for liquor licenses apply to  applicants for a certificate of 22 
approval and by specifying that persons that have been issued certificates of approval 23 
are subject to administrative discipline for violating liquor laws and rules under Title 24 
28-A, chapter 33 to the same extent as persons that have been issued licenses.  25 
E.  It removes a conflict in the law by repealing a provision requiring the Department 26 
of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 27 
Operations to deposit the yearly fees paid by certifi cate of approval holders into the 28 
General Fund because, under Title 28 -A, section 83 -B, the bureau is directed to 29 
deposit its net revenues in the General Fund.  30 
2.  It removes ambiguous language from the Title 28 -A definitions section stating that 31 
only "res ponsible persons" or "persons of good reputation" may obtain certain types of 32 
liquor licenses but retains the general character requirements for licensure set forth in 33 
section 654.  34 
3.  It moves the definitions of "pool hall" and "minibar" into and the defi nitions of 35 
"club member," "hotel guest," "dining car," "passenger car" and "vessel" out of the 36 
subsection of law that provides definitions for the types of establishments eligible to 37 
obtain retail liquor licenses.  It also ensures consistent use of these d efined terms 38 
throughout the Title.  39 
4.  It replaces the word "club" with the word "center" in the statutes describing the 40 
requirements for licensure of indoor racquet centers, ice skating centers and curling 41 
 
 Page 104 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 centers to dispel confusion regarding whether the  licensure requirements applicable to 1 
clubs apply to these centers.  It also corrects several errors in the law that, in combination, 2 
suggest curling centers may be licensed to sell only wine and not spirits or malt liquor.  3 
5.  It makes a number of changes  to the laws requiring that certain on -premises retail 4 
licensees either offer food to the public or sell a specific amount of food to the public to 5 
maintain their eligibility for a liquor license, including:  6 
A.  Replacing several duplicative definitions of  "full course meal" with the 7 
substantively identical definition of "full meal" that also appears in current law and 8 
ensuring consistent use of this defined term throughout the Title;  9 
B. Removing language regarding the service of meals from the definition o f "hotel," 10 
because hotels are not required to sell meals to the public under existing law;  11 
C.  Removing a conflict in current law by specifying that a hotel with a Class I -A 12 
license is not required to have 10% of its gross annual income from the sale of fo od; 13 
D.  Clarifying that, to calculate whether a hotel that does not have a Class I -A license 14 
has satisfied the requirement that at least 10% of its gross annual income be from the 15 
sale of food, the hotel's income from the rental of rooms or from the sale o f liquor in 16 
separately licensed minibars is not included.  This new provision matches current 17 
practice and mirrors an existing provision of law that excludes income from the 18 
bowling business in calculating whether the bowling center has satisfied the 19 
requi rement that at least 10% of its gross annual income be from the sale of food;  20 
E.  Clarifying that qualified catering services may be located in unincorporated places 21 
and filling an omission in current law by specifying that a licensed part -time qualified 22 
catering service that operates for no more than 3 months in a year in a municipality 23 
having a population of 20,001 to 30,000 persons must have a minimum annual gross 24 
income of $10,000 from the sale of food to the public;  25 
F.  Standardizing language regarding  the Department of Administrative and Financial 26 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations' assessment of 27 
whether an applicant for an initial on -premises retail license is likely to meet or an 28 
applicant for renewal of an on -premises ret ail license has met any applicable food - 29 
sales requirements; and  30 
G.  Establishing a new one -year grace period for an on -premises retail establishment 31 
that applies for license renewal but did not meet an applicable food -sales requirement 32 
during the previous year.  33 
6.  It defines "spirits supplier," a previously undefined term, and standardizes the 34 
statutory language used to describe spirits suppliers throughout the State's liquor laws, 35 
including by removing references to spirits brokers that are now included i n the "spirits 36 
supplier" definition.  It also newly authorizes spirits suppliers to offer sweepstakes, 37 
games and contests inside packages of spirits under the same conditions that licensed 38 
Maine manufacturers, wholesale licensees and retail licensees may o ffer sweepstakes, 39 
games and contests inside packages of liquor.  40 
 
 Page 105 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 7.  It replaces the term "liquor," which is defined for purposes of the State's liquor 1 
laws to mean malt liquor, wine and spirits, with more specific terms in several statutes 2 
when all 3 types  of alcohol are not intended to be included.  3 
8.  It removes unnecessary statutory references to fortified wine in statutes that 4 
govern wine generally, because "wine" is defined for purposes of the State's liquor laws 5 
to include fortified wine.  6 
9.  It resol ves an inconsistency by providing that public service corporation licenses 7 
are issued to airline corporations, railroad corporations and vessel corporations and not 8 
the individual aircraft, dining cars, passenger cars and vessels that those corporations 9 
operate in the State.  It also removes a duplicative statute governing public service 10 
corporations and standardizes the language used throughout the Title regarding public 11 
service corporations.  12 
10.  It clarifies an ambiguity in the law by specifying that the  term "wholesale 13 
licensee" as used in the State's liquor laws means only a licensed in -state wholesaler of 14 
malt liquor or wine and not an out -of-state wholesaler of malt liquor or wine that has been 15 
issued a certificate of approval.  It also extends the pr ohibition against a wholesale 16 
licensee selling to another wholesale licensee any malt liquor or wine that has not been 17 
purchased from a certificate of approval holder or a licensed special warehouse storage 18 
facility to a prohibition against a wholesale lic ensee selling such products to any 19 
purchaser, including a retail licensee.  20 
11.  It replaces the phrase "wholesale liquor provider" with the phrase "wholesale 21 
spirits provider" throughout the State's liquor laws to more accurately describe the scope 22 
of that  entity's authority in the State.  It also removes an inconsistency in the law by 23 
specifying that the wholesale spirits provider and the principal officers of the wholesale 24 
spirits provider may not hold or have a direct financial interest in an agency liqu or store 25 
license or a license to manufacture any type of liquor in this State or another state.  26 
12.  It makes several changes to the laws governing hard cider to address ambiguities 27 
and omissions in those laws in a manner that matches current practice, inc luding by 28 
making the following changes.  29 
A.  Although hard cider technically meets the definition of "wine" under existing law, 30 
it adds clarifying language expressly stating that hard cider is considered "wine" for 31 
purposes of the Title.  32 
B.  It clarifies th at hard cider may be sold by retailers licensed to sell either malt 33 
liquor or wine for on -premises or off -premises consumption.  34 
C.  It provides that hard cider may be sold and distributed within the State by 35 
wholesale licensees authorized to sell and distr ibute either malt liquor or wine within 36 
the State.  37 
D.  It clarifies that hard cider is not subject to the general 60¢ per gallon excise tax on 38 
wine set forth in Title 28 -A, section 1652, subsection 2.  Hard cider products are 39 
instead subject only to the 35 ¢ per gallon excise tax on hard cider set forth in the 40 
same subsection.  41 
 
 Page 106 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 13.  It makes several changes to the laws governing low -alcohol spirits products to 1 
address ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions in those laws, including by making 2 
the following changes.  3 
A.  It clarifies that products containing less than 1/2 of 1% of alcohol by volume are 4 
not considered low -alcohol spirits products, just as all products containing less than 5 
1/2 of 1% of alcohol by volume are not considered liquor and thus not sub ject to 6 
regulation under the Title.  7 
B.  It newly specifies that licensed Maine distilleries, small distilleries and rectifiers 8 
are authorized to produce low -alcohol spirits products and that licensed Maine 9 
breweries, small breweries and tenant breweries ar e authorized to produce low - 10 
alcohol spirits products containing malt liquor.  Current law already authorizes 11 
licensed Maine wineries and tenant wineries to produce low -alcohol spirits products 12 
that contain wine, because these products are included in the d efinition of "fortified 13 
wine."  14 
C.  It specifies that, as is current practice, low -alcohol spirits products may be sold 15 
and distributed within the State by wholesale licensees authorized to sell and 16 
distribute wine within the State.  17 
D.  It clarifies that, a s is current practice, low -alcohol spirits products that qualify as 18 
fortified wine are not subject to the general 60¢ per gallon excise tax on wine under 19 
Title 28 -A, section 1652, subsection 2.  All low -alcohol spirits products are instead 20 
subject to a $1. 24 per gallon excise tax under section 1652, subsection 1 -A and a 30¢ 21 
per gallon low -alcohol spirits product tax under section 1365.  22 
14.  It replaces the phrase "alcoholic beverages," which is not defined for the 23 
purposes of the State's liquor laws, with t he appropriate defined terms throughout the 24 
liquor laws.  25 
15.  It combines in a single section of statute the licensing fees for agency liquor 26 
stores that are currently listed in separate provisions.  It also removes an ambiguity in the 27 
law by clarifying th at, as is the current practice, agency liquor store licenses grant 28 
authority to sell not only spirits but also malt liquor and wine for off -premises 29 
consumption.  30 
16.  It clarifies that an applicant for a liquor license must possess all licenses, permits 31 
or approvals required under Title 22 for the applicant's underlying business before 32 
applying for the liquor license.  33 
17.  It removes inconsistencies in several provisions of the liquor laws regarding the 34 
types of establishments eligible to obtain auxiliary l icenses, off -premises catering licenses 35 
and mobile service bar licenses.  It also specifies that, as is current practice, when an on - 36 
premises retail licensee obtains an off -premises catering license, that license authorizes 37 
the licensee to conduct off -prem ises catering of only the same type or types of liquor that 38 
the licensee may sell pursuant to the licensee's underlying on -premises retail license.  39 
18.  It makes a number of changes to the laws governing liquor taste -testing events 40 
and product sampling act ivities to address ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions in 41 
those laws, including the following.  42 
 
 Page 107 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 A.  It clarifies that the prohibitions against serving liquor to minors or to visibly 1 
intoxicated persons apply to all authorized liquor taste -testing and  product sampling 2 
events.  3 
B.  It newly specifies who, other than a licensed sales representative, may pour 4 
samples at taste -testing and product sampling events.  Under the bill, samples may 5 
also be poured by an employee of the off -premises or on -premises r etailer where the 6 
taste-testing or product sampling event takes place or, where applicable, by the owner 7 
or employee of the licensed Maine manufacturer that produced the product being 8 
tasted or sampled.  9 
C.  It clarifies an ambiguity by specifying that, oth er than during an authorized taste - 10 
testing or product sampling event, an off -premises retail licensee has a duty to 11 
prevent the consumption of liquor on that retail licensee's premises.  12 
D.  It resolves a conflict in current law by providing that, when an a uthorized taste - 13 
testing event is held on a portion of the premises of an on -premises retail licensee, the 14 
bureau must temporarily suspend the authority of the on -premises retail licensee to 15 
sell liquor for on -premises consumption in the area designated for  the taste -testing 16 
event.  The on -premises retail licensee may nevertheless continue to sell liquor for 17 
on-premises consumption on the portion of its premises that falls outside the area 18 
designated for the taste -testing event.  19 
E.  It fills an omission in t he law by specifying that an out -of-state manufacturer that 20 
is sponsored by a certificate of approval holder, wholesale licensee or spirits supplier 21 
to participate in a taste -testing event may provide for taste testing any spirits, wine or 22 
malt liquor prod uced by the sponsored manufacturer, even though those products are 23 
not currently listed for sale in the State.  24 
F.  It moves the statutory language granting licensed Maine liquor manufacturers the 25 
authority to sell their products at certain taste -testing ev ents from the manufacturer 26 
licensing statute to the relevant taste -testing event statute for clarity and grants small 27 
distilleries new authority to self -distribute their spirits products for sale at these taste - 28 
testing events.  29 
G.  It restricts the types of  individuals who may receive partial -bottle samples of 30 
spirits or wine under statutes authorizing sampling by retail licensees to the owner 31 
and supervisory or managerial employees of the retail licensee.  This restriction exists 32 
in current law only for the  receipt of partial -bottle samples of spirits by employees of 33 
agency liquor stores.  34 
19.  It corrects an error in current law that suggests on -premises retail licenses are 35 
issued to international air terminals and instead specifies that on -premises retail l icenses 36 
may be issued to qualified establishments located within international air terminals.  37 
20.  It streamlines the process for disposal of spirits subject to a court's forfeiture 38 
order by newly authorizing the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 39 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations or a wholesale spirits provider to 40 
choose, without obtaining an additional court order, to destroy the forfeited spirits rather 41 
than to restock and resell the forfeited spirits in agency liquor  stores.  42 
 
 Page 108 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 21.  It makes a number of changes to the State's laws governing the administration 1 
and sale of spirits in the State to address errors and inconsistencies in those laws, 2 
including the following.  3 
A.  It amends conflicting provisions of law regarding  the pricing of spirits to clarify 4 
that, as is current practice, the State Liquor and Lottery Commission establishes the 5 
retail price of spirits and the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 6 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operatio ns establishes the wholesale 7 
price of spirits, which is the price that agency liquor stores pay to purchase spirits 8 
from the bureau.  9 
B.  It resolves a conflict in the laws governing the purchase of spirits by removing 10 
statutory language suggesting that age ncy liquor stores may purchase spirits from a 11 
wholesale spirits provider and retaining provisions of law correctly stating that 12 
agency liquor stores purchase spirits only from the bureau.  13 
C.  It amends statutory provisions incorrectly suggesting that any a gency liquor store 14 
may sell or deliver spirits to on -premises retailers and clarifies that only agency 15 
liquor stores that are licensed as reselling agents may make these sales and deliveries.  16 
22.  It makes a number of additional changes to Title 28 -A, sect ion 1355 -A, the 17 
statute governing the licensure of Maine liquor manufacturers, including the following.  18 
A.  It restores the statutory authority of Maine bottlers and rectifiers to obtain 19 
licenses, which authority was unintentionally repealed through Public  Law 2019, 20 
chapter 529.  It also newly specifies the types of sampling activities that may occur 21 
on the premises of a licensed Maine bottler or rectifier under current practice.  22 
B.  It combines in one location several scattered provisions describing the au thority 23 
of licensed Maine breweries, small breweries, wineries, small wineries, distilleries 24 
and small distilleries, at the manufacturing facility where their products are produced, 25 
to sell samples of those products to the public or offer samples of those products to 26 
the public at no cost.  It newly clarifies that samples may not be served to minors or 27 
visibly intoxicated persons and that the area of the manufacturing facility where these 28 
samples are sold or offered need not be separate from and may be acce ssed by the 29 
same entrance as the area of the manufacturing facility that is licensed for on - 30 
premises retail sales.  31 
C.  It combines in one location several scattered provisions describing the authority 32 
of licensed Maine breweries, small breweries, wineries,  small wineries, distilleries 33 
and small distilleries, at the manufacturing facility where their products are produced, 34 
to sell their products for off -premises consumption.  35 
D.  It moves the provision authorizing Maine breweries and small breweries to sell 36 
malt liquor for off -premises consumption in kegs from a generally applicable 37 
subsection of the statute to the subsection of the statute specifically applicable to 38 
breweries and small breweries.  39 
E.  It moves the provision requiring Maine small breweries and small wineries to 40 
keep and maintain records of their sales to retail licensees from a generally applicable 41 
subsection of the statute to the 2 subsections of the statute specifically applicable to 42 
small breweries and to small wineries.  43 
 
 Page 109 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 F.  It clarifies that , as is current practice, when calculating whether a licensed Maine 1 
manufacturing facility's one statutorily authorized establishment for on -premises 2 
sales has satisfied any applicable statutory requirement that 10% of its gross annual 3 
income be from the s ale of food, income from the Maine manufacturer's sale of liquor 4 
samples or sale of liquor for off -premises consumption is not included.  5 
G.  It clarifies the language of the provision authorizing each licensed Maine 6 
brewery, small brewery, winery, small wi nery, distillery and small distillery to obtain 7 
one license to conduct on -premises retail sales per licensed manufacturing facility.  It 8 
also relaxes the requirements applicable when a distillery or small distillery obtains 9 
this type of on -premises retail license by eliminating the requirements that the on - 10 
premises retail establishment be a Class A restaurant or Class A restaurant/lounge 11 
owned by the same person who owns the distillery or small distillery.  Instead, under 12 
the bill a distillery or small dist illery may obtain any type of on -premises retail 13 
license as long as the same person or persons holds a majority ownership interest in 14 
the on -premises retail license and the distillery or small distillery.  These relaxed 15 
requirements match the requirements applicable under current law when a licensed 16 
brewery, small brewery, winery or small winery obtains this type of on -premises 17 
retail license.  18 
H.  It newly authorizes a licensed Maine manufacturer that has its one statutorily 19 
authorized licensed establishmen t for on -premises sales at a location separate from its 20 
manufacturing facility to conduct sales of its products for off -premises consumption 21 
at that separate licensed location.  Under current law, a Maine manufacturer may 22 
conduct sales of its products for off-premises consumption at its one licensed 23 
establishment for on -premises sales only if the on -premises establishment is located 24 
at the manufacturing facility.  Similarly, the bill newly specifies that the products that 25 
may be sold for off -premises consum ption at the separate licensed location include, 26 
when the licensed Maine manufacturer is a brewery or a small brewery, malt liquor 27 
packaged in refillable containers, commonly referred to as growlers.  Under current 28 
law, a brewery or small brewery may sell growlers at its one licensed establishment 29 
for on -premises sales only if that on -premises establishment is located at the brewery 30 
or small brewery.  31 
I.  It resolves a conflict in current law and conforms the law to current practice by 32 
specifying that, when a small distillery serves samples of its products at its 33 
manufacturing facility, it need not first send those products through the State's spirits 34 
warehouse and distribution system.  35 
J.  It clarifies an ambiguity in the law by explicitly stating that a lice nsed Maine small 36 
winery, which may under current law obtain licenses to conduct off -premises retail 37 
sales at up to 2 additional locations other than the manufacturing facility, must pay a 38 
$50 license fee for each of those additional locations.  It similarl y clarifies that a 39 
licensed small distillery, which may under current law also obtain licenses to conduct 40 
off-premises retail sales at up to 2 additional locations other than the manufacturing 41 
facility, must pay a $100 license fee for each of those additio nal locations.  42 
K.  It corrects an omission in the law and matches current practice by specifying that 43 
a tenant brewery or tenant winery seeking licensure may pay the reduced license fee 44 
for a small brewery or small winery if it qualifies as a small brewery  or small winery.  45 
 
 Page 110 - 129LR3164(01) -1 
 Otherwise, the tenant brewery or tenant winery must pay the higher brewery or 1 
winery license fee.  2 
23.  It reorganizes, clarifies and removes inconsistencies in the laws governing the 3 
importation of liquor into and the transportation of l iquor within the State.  It also 4 
changes the units of measurement applicable to spirits and wine in these provisions from 5 
quarts and gallons to liters, which is the unit of measurement typically used when 6 
referring to spirits and wine products, and it chan ges the unit of measurement applicable 7 
to malt liquor from gallons to fluid ounces, which is the unit of measurement typically 8 
used when referring to malt liquor products.  9 
24.  It corrects scattered typographical, cross -reference and drafting errors in the  10 
Title, including by removing all gendered pronouns as required by Public Law 2019, 11 
chapter 475, section 52.  12
