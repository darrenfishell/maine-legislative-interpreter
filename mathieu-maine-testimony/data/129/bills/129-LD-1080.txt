5biofuel to be used in #2 heating oil; and
6Whereas, it is imperative that this study begin as soon as possible in order for it to

12Sec. 1.  Biofuels in heating oil study.  Resolved:  That the Executive 
13Department, Governor's Energy Office, referred to in this section as "the office," shall 
14oversee a study of the energy, environmental and economic feasibility of setting a 
15requirement for the percentage of biofuel to be used in #2 heating oil.  As used in this 
16section, "biofuel" means any commercially produced liquid or gas used to ignite a heating 
17device or a stationary power device or otherwise substitute for liquid or gaseous fuels that 
18is derived from renewable biomass, including, but not limited to, agricultural crops and 
19residues, forest products and by-products and separated food waste, as distinct from 
20petroleum or other fossil carbon sources.
211.  The study must include, but is not limited to, the following:
22A.  The feasibility of linking annual production of biofuel in the State to use goals 
23and requirements;
24B.  Consideration of biofuel supply, price and infrastructure issues for #2 heating oil;
25C.  Consideration of federal regulations and programs, including, but not limited to, 
26the United States Environmental Protection Agency's renewable fuel standard and the 
27United States Department of Agriculture's biomass crop assistance program;
28D.  Consideration of relevant legislative proposals and actions in the United States 
29Congress, including, but not limited to, low-carbon fuel standards;
30E.  Consideration of relevant policies in other states, particularly in other New 
31England states; and
32F.  Conformance of goals with the office's 2015 state comprehensive energy plan.
332.  The study must supplement the April 2011 report by the office titled "Biofuels in 
34Heating Oil" and update recommendations regarding the establishment of an alternative 
35fuel incentive program to stimulate the production, distribution and use of biofuels in #2 
36heating oil.
Page 2 - 129LR1757(01)-113.  In carrying out the study, the office shall consult with the Department of 
2Environmental Protection, the Public Utilities Commission and the Efficiency Maine 
3Trust Board.
44.  Performance of the study's examination of supply goals and requirements and 
5price considerations under subsection 1 is dependent on receipt of funding through a 3rd-
6party grant or donation.  Performance of the study's update of policy recommendations to 
7stimulate the production, distribution and use of biofuels, with supply goals and price 
8considerations, must be undertaken by the office regardless of funding source.
9By February 15, 2020, the office shall submit a report of its findings and 
10recommendations, together with any necessary implementing legislation, to the Joint 
11Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
12Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
13legislation takes effect when approved.
14SUMMARY
15This resolve directs the Executive Department, Governor's Energy Office to oversee a 
16study of and report to the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural
