6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. 
8 This amendment repeals the temporary licensure process for an individual with an 
9 out-of-state license to practice funeral service. The amendment removes the teim 
10 "permanent" from the language describing the issuance of a license to an applicant with 
11 an out-of-state license and also removes a clause exempting such a license from annual 
12 renewal. The amendment adds language stating that the license of the out-of-state 
13 licensee must be active, unrestricted and without disciplinary action. The amendment 
14 requires the State Board of Funeral Service to adopt rules to implement the section 
15 describing the issuance of a license to an out-of-state licensee, and specifically requires 
16 that rules define what constitutes substantially similar license requirements. The 
17 amendment also changes the continuing education requirements to allow for 6, rather 
18 than 8 hours to be conducted remotely, and removes the requirement that all continuing 
19 education programs be approved by the board.
