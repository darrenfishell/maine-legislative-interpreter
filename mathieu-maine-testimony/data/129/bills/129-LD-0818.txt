9further amended to read:
103.  Commission authority.  The commission may direct investor-owned 
11transmission and distribution utilities to enter into long-term contracts for:
12A.  Capacity resources;
13B.  Any available energy associated with capacity resources contracted under 
14paragraph A:
15(1)  To the extent necessary to fulfill the policy of subsection 2, paragraph A; or
16(2)  If the commission determines appropriate for purposes of supplying or 
17lowering the cost of standard-offer service or otherwise lowering the cost of 
18electricity for the ratepayers in the State.  Available energy contracted pursuant to 
19this subparagraph may be sold into the wholesale electricity market in 
20conjunction with solicitations for standard-offer supply bids; 
21C.  Any available renewable energy credits associated with capacity resources 
22contracted under paragraph A.  The price paid by the investor-owned transmission 
23and distribution utility for the renewable energy credits must be lower than the price

25investor-owned transmission and distribution utility; and
26D.  Transmission capacity, capacity resources, energy or renewable energy credits 
27pursuant to a regional procurement process in conjunction with other states.
28The commission may permit, but may not require, investor-owned transmission and 
29distribution utilities to enter into contracts for differences that are designed and intended 
30to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 
31development.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 
32for long-term contracts for investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities under 
33this subsection having the same legal and financial effect as the procedures used for 
34standard-offer service pursuant to section 3212 for investor-owned transmission and 
35distribution utilities.
36The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible, demand response or energy 
37efficiency capacity resources.  These contracts are not subject to the rules of the State 
38Purchasing Agent.  In a competitive solicitation conducted pursuant to subsection 6, the 
39commission shall allow transmission and distribution utilities to submit bids for 
40interruptible or demand response capacity resources.
41Capacity resources contracted under this subsection may not exceed the amount 
42necessary to ensure the reliability of the electric grid of this State, to meet the energy 
Page 4 - 129LR1927(01)-11efficiency program budget allocations articulated in the triennial plan as approved by the 
2commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4 or any annual update plan approved 
3by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 6 or to lower customer costs as 
4determined by the commission pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 10.
5Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a capacity 
6resource may not be contracted under this subsection unless the commission determines 
7that the capacity resource is recognized as a capacity resource for purposes of any 
8regional or federal capacity requirements.
9The commission shall ensure that any long-term contract authorized under this subsection 
10is consistent with the State's goals for greenhouse gas reduction levels under Title 38, 
11section 576 576-A and the regional greenhouse gas initiative as described in the state 
12climate action plan required in Title 38, section 577 579.
13By January 1st of each year, the commission shall submit a report to the joint standing 
14committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters on the 
15procurement of transmission capacity, capacity resources, energy and renewable energy 
16credits in the preceding 12 months under this subsection, the Community-based 
17Renewable Energy Act and deep-water offshore wind energy pilot projects under Public 
18Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, section 6, as amended by Public Law 2013, chapter 369, 
19Part H, sections 1 and 2 and chapter 378, sections 4 to 6. The report must contain 
20information including, but not limited to, the number of requests for proposals by the 
21commission for long-term contracts, the number of responses to requests for proposals 
22pursuant to which a contract has been finalized, the number of executed term sheets or 
23contracts resulting from the requests for proposals, the commission's initial estimates of 
24ratepayer costs or savings associated with any approved term sheet, actual ratepayer costs 
25or savings for the previous year associated with any procurement, the total ratepayer costs 
26or savings at the time of the report and the megawatt-hours, renewable energy credits or 
27capacity produced or procured through contracts. The report must also include a plan for 
28the succeeding 12 months pertaining to the procurement of capacity resources, energy 
29and renewable energy credits, including dates for requests for proposals, and types of 
30resources to be procured.

32§2, is further amended to read:
33A.  Wind energy is an economically feasible, large-scale energy resource that does 
34not rely on fossil fuel combustion or nuclear fission, thereby displacing electrical 
35energy provided by these other sources and avoiding air pollution, waste disposal 
36problems and hazards to human health from emissions, waste and by-products; 
37consequently, wind energy development may address energy needs while making a 
38significant contribution to achievement of the State's renewable energy and 
39greenhouse gas reduction objectives, including those in Title 38, section 576 576-A; 
40Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§4, ¶F, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, 
41c. 369, Pt. A, §13, is amended to read:
42F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 
43energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 
Page 5 - 129LR1927(01)-11consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 
2and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 
3funding necessary to meet those goals:
4(1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;
5(2) Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 
6to participate in and share the costs of cost-effective home weatherization to a 
7minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;
8(3) Reducing peak-load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 
9megawatts by 2020;
10(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 
1120% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 
12pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 
13section 10120;
14(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 
15efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and
16(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 
17in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals reduction levels 
18established in Title 38, section 576 576-A.
19The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 
20emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 
21program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 
22may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 
23generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.
24Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 
25trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 
26as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 
27low-income weatherization programs.
28As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 
29#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 
30processes.
31Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §574, sub-§§1-A, 1-B and 1-C are enacted to read:
321-A.  Climate action plan.  "Climate action plan" means the state plan adopted in 
332004 by the department under this chapter to address greenhouse gas emissions 
34reductions in each sector in cost-effective ways.
351-B.  Gross annual greenhouse gas emissions. "Gross annual greenhouse gas 
36emissions" means the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted by all sources within the 
37State each year.
381-C.  Net annual greenhouse gas emissions.  "Net annual greenhouse gas 
39emissions" means gross annual greenhouse gas emissions less the total amount of 
40greenhouse gases absorbed each year by trees, crops, soil and wetlands within the State.
Page 6 - 129LR1927(01)-11Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §576, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 237, §1, is repealed.

3§576-A.  Greenhouse gas emissions reductions
41.  2030 annual emissions level.  By January 1, 2030, the State shall reduce net 
5annual greenhouse gas emissions to at least 80% below the 1990 net annual greenhouse 
6gas emissions level.
72.  Interim emissions levels.  The department shall adopt rules establishing interim 
8net annual greenhouse gas emissions levels.  The interim net annual greenhouse gas 
9emissions levels must maximize the State's ability to meet the 2030 net annual 
10greenhouse gas emissions level.
11Sec. 9.  38 MRSA §577, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 237, §1, is repealed and the 
12following enacted in its place:
13§577.  Action plan; long-term goal
141.  Long-term reduction goal.  The State's long-term reduction goal is to reduce net 
15annual greenhouse gas emissions to an extent sufficient to minimize harmful effects of 
16climate change.  To accomplish this goal, reducing net annual greenhouse gas emissions 
17to zero by 2050 may be necessary.
182.  Climate action plan update.  By December 1, 2019, the department, with input 
19from stakeholders, shall update the State's climate action plan to meet the reduction levels 
20in section 576-A.  In updating the climate action plan, the department shall conduct a 
21study examining pathways to reduce net annual greenhouse gas emissions consistent with 
22the levels in section 576-A and with the long-term goal in subsection 1.  The department 
23shall analyze and report on the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of each 
24pathway.  The department shall submit the study to the joint standing committee of the 
25Legislature having jurisdiction over natural resources matters, which is authorized to 
26report out legislation related to the study.  In identifying the preferred pathways to 
27include in the updated climate action plan, the department shall give consideration to the 
28following objectives:
29A.  Lowering the total economic cost of energy to residents of and businesses in the 
30State, including the economic cost of energy imports;
31B.  Effectively using natural solutions to reduce net annual greenhouse gas emissions, 
32such as using forests and agricultural lands in the State; and
33C.  Ensuring that all sectors and regions of the State and the broadest group of 
34residents benefit from reaching the levels in section 576-A and the long-term goal in 
35subsection 1, with consideration to economic, quality-of-life and public health 
36benefits.
37Sec. 10.  38 MRSA §577-A is enacted to read:
Page 7 - 129LR1927(01)-11§577-A.  Emission standards
2By January 1, 2020, the board shall establish by rule emission standards limiting and 
3regulating in a just and equitable manner the amount of greenhouse gases that may be 
4emitted to the air.  The emission standards must be designed to achieve and maintain the 
5reduction levels in section 576-A.
6Prior to the establishment of emission standards under this section, the board shall 
7hold a public hearing in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375.  The board shall solicit and 
8consider all available information concerning the existing greenhouse gas emissions and 
9their nature, amount and sources; the effect of the emissions upon the climate; the 
10availability, effectiveness and cost of control apparatus to prevent and control such 
11emissions; and such other evidence as in the board's judgment will enable it to determine 
12and establish emission standards that will achieve and maintain the reduction goals 
13specified in section 576-A.
14To achieve the emission standards, the board shall by rule, or by air emission license 
15conditions, establish limits on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for individual 
16sources or for source categories. The rule or license condition must state the date upon 
17which the limit becomes effective. In establishing the date, the board shall consider the 
18degree of existing greenhouse gas emissions, the length of time necessary to inform 
19persons affected by the limit, the time needed by the board to implement effective 
20controls and the time needed by persons affected to design and install emission control 
21apparatus to comply with the limit.
22Rules adopted pursuant to this section are major substantive rules as defined in Title 
235, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
24Sec. 11.  38 MRSA §578, as amended by PL 2013, c. 415, §5, is further amended
