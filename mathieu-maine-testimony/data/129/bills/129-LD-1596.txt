311.  Definitions.  As used in this subchapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, 
32the following terms have the following meanings.
Page 2 - 129LR1676(01)-11A.  "At-risk" means there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child's health, safety 
2and welfare is in jeopardy due to abuse, neglect, abandonment or similar 
3circumstances and that return to the child's or the child's parent's country of origin or 
4country of last habitual residence would not be in the best interest of the child.
5B.  Notwithstanding section 4002, subsection 2, "child" means an unmarried person 
6who has not attained 21 years of age.
7C.  "Court" includes, but is not limited to, the Probate Court and District Court, or 
8any other state court with juvenile jurisdiction.
9D.  "Dependent on the court" means subject to the jurisdiction of a court competent to 
10make decisions concerning the protection, well-being, care and custody of a child for 
11findings, orders or referrals to support the health, safety and welfare of a child or to 
12remedy the effects on a child of abuse, neglect, abandonment or similar 
13circumstances.
14E.  "Noncitizen" means any person who is not a United States citizen.
15F.  "Similar circumstances" means conditions that have an effect on a child 
16comparable to abuse, neglect or abandonment, including, but not limited to, the death 
17of a parent.
182.  Petition for special findings and rulings for certain at-risk noncitizen 
19children.  An at-risk noncitizen child may petition the court for special findings. Upon 
20reviewing the petition or complaint seeking special findings, any supporting affidavits 
21and other evidence presented, the court shall issue findings of fact and rulings of law that 
22must determine whether the child who is the subject of the proceeding:
23A.  Is dependent on the court;
24B.  Has suffered from abuse, neglect, abandonment or similar circumstances;
25C.  May not be viably reunified with one or both parents due to abuse, neglect, 
26abandonment or similar circumstances; and
27D.  May not be returned to the child's or the child's parent's country of origin or 
28country of last habitual residence because it is not in the best interest of the child.
29A court making a decision under this subsection is acting as a juvenile court in that it has 
30jurisdiction over a child.
31The health and safety of the child must be of paramount concern. When considering the 
32child's health and safety, the court shall consider whether present or past living conditions 
33will adversely affect the child's physical, mental or emotional health.
34The at-risk noncitizen child is not required to name as a respondent a parent with whom 
35reunification may be a viable option.
363.  Notice.  If the identity or location of the child's parents is unknown or if the 
37parents reside outside of the United States, the court may serve notice using any 
38alternative method of service the court determines is appropriate or waive service when 
39the child is described in 8 United States Code, Section 1101(a)(27)(J)(2019) and 8 United 
40States Code, Section 1357(h)(2019).
Page 3 - 129LR1676(01)-114.  Expeditious adjudication.  A court shall hear, adjudicate and issue findings of 
2fact and rulings of law on any petition or complaint for special findings under this section 
3as soon as it is administratively feasible and prior to the child reaching 21 years of age to 
4serve the best interest of the child.
55.  Referral for services or protection.  A child who is the subject of a petition for 
6special findings under subsection 2 may be referred for psychiatric, psychological, 
7educational, occupational, medical, dental or social services or for protection against 
8human trafficking or domestic violence.  Participation in any referred services is 
9voluntary.
106.  Similar findings of fact and rulings of law.  Nothing in this section prevents the 
11court from issuing similar findings of fact and rulings of law to those in subsection 2 in 
12any other proceeding concerning a noncitizen child.
137.  Construction.  This section must be liberally construed to promote the best 
14interest of the child.
15Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
16legislation takes effect July 1, 2019.
