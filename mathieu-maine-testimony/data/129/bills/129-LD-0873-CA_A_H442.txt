Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium revenue decrease -General Fund 
Potential current biennium revenue decrease -Local Government Fund 
This bill would exempt water well-drilling equipment from the motor vehicle excise tax and therefore it would 
become eligible for assessment of property taxes. If the business is also eligible for either the Business Equipment 
Tax Reimbursement (BETR) or Business Equipment Tax Exemption (BETE) programs, reimbursements to taxpayers 
or municipalities would be increased. No estimate of any potential increase has been made. 
The bill would decrease municipal excise tax revenues. However, some of this reduction could be made up by the 
assessment of property taxes. No estimate has been made at this time.
