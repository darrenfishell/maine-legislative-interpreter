Page 1 - 129LR1590(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA ยง1252, sub-ยง5-A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 485, ยง5, is 
3further amended to read:
45-A.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, for a person convicted of 
5violating section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D, 1105-E or 1118-A: 
6A.    Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs B and C, the minimum sentence of 
7imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows: When the sentencing class 
8is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 4 years; when the sentencing class 
9is Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 2 years; and, with the exception of 
10a conviction under section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C or 1105-D when the drug that is 
11the basis for the charge is marijuana, when the sentencing class is Class C, the 
12minimum term of imprisonment is one year;
13B.  The court may impose a sentence other than a minimum unsuspended term of 
14imprisonment set forth in paragraph A, if: 
15(1)  The court finds by substantial evidence that: 
16(a)  Imposition of a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
17paragraph A will result in substantial injustice to the defendant.  In making 
18this determination, the court shall consider, among other considerations, 
19whether the defendant did not know and reasonably should not have known 
20that the victim was less than 18 years of age;
21(b)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
22paragraph A will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and
23(c)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 
24paragraph A will not appreciably impair the effect of paragraph A in 
25deterring others from violating section 1105-A, 1105-B, 1105-C, 1105-D, 
261105-E or 1118-A; and
27(2)  The court finds that:
28(c)  The defendant's background, attitude and prospects for rehabilitation and 
29the nature of the victim and the offense indicate that imposition of a sentence 
30under paragraph A would frustrate the general purposes of sentencing set 
31forth in section 1151.
32If the court imposes a sentence under this paragraph, the court shall state in writing 
33its reasons for its findings and for imposing a sentence under this paragraph rather 
34than under paragraph A; and
35C.    If the court imposes a sentence under paragraph B, the minimum sentence of 
36imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows: When the sentencing class 
37is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 9 months; when the sentencing is 
38Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 6 months; and, with the exception of 
39trafficking or furnishing marijuana under section 1105-A or 1105-C, when the 
40sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is 3 months.
