28 SUMMARY
29 This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide and pay 
30 for services relating to and treatment for substance use disorder in cases in which it does 
31 not file a child protection petition under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 
32 4032 but does open a case to provide services to the family to alleviate child abuse and 
33 neglect in the home, and also to provide and pay for those services as part of the 
34 rehabilitation and reunification plan required pursuant to Title 22, section 4041 when a 
35 child has been removed from the home.  The bill provides that the department is not 
36 financially responsible if the person receiving services is insured by MaineCare or other 
37 insurance and that insurance covers the cost of those services.  The bill establishes a 
38 program within the department for families affected by substance use disorder.  The 
39 department is required to create a process to identify families engaged in a rehabilitation 
40 and reunification plan in which substance use disorder is a barrier to the return of a child 
41 to the child's home and ensure the family receives intervention and treatment for the 
42 disorder.
