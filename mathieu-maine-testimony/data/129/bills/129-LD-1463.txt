9subchapter 9 and present those rules for approval to the Second Regular Session of the

15SUMMARY
16This bill establishes, beginning January 1, 2022, a method of automatically 
17registering eligible individuals to vote.  The Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau 
18of Motor Vehicles, when receiving any documentation from an individual doing business 
19with the bureau, including applying for or renewing a driver's license or nondriver 
20identification card, is required to scan and electronically store the documentation 
21provided by the individual.  If the documentation provides proof of eligibility to vote, 
22including citizenship, age and residency, that individual is added to the central voter 
23registration system and relevant information is transmitted to election officials unless the 
24individual, at the time of the collection of the documentation, chooses not to be registered 
25to vote, which the Secretary of State is required to ensure that an individual is given the 
26opportunity to do.  An application or document used to collect information that may be 
27used to register an individual must contain a notice that the individual's information may 
28be used to register that individual to vote, meaning that the information would be 
29available by persons other than the State or election officials.  An election official must 
30provide the same notice to an individual upon receipt of the registration record from the 
31Bureau of Motor Vehicles and also must inform the individual of the ability to choose not 
32to be registered to vote and to pick a party affiliation. If the individual fails to respond 
33within 21 days, the individual is considered a registered voter if that individual meets the 
34qualifications to be registered as a voter.
35The Secretary of State and the Governor are allowed to designate other state agencies 
36and departments and public and private entities, such as colleges and municipal clerk 
37offices, as so-called source agencies that are allowed to submit registration information to 
38the bureau for inclusion in the central voter registration system, but only if those 
39agencies, as part of their normal course of business, collect information that provides 
40proof of eligibility to vote, including an entity that, as of January 1, 2022, is designated 
41under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 as a voter registration agency that 
42collects information that provides proof of voter eligibility.  A source agency is required 
43to comply with the same restrictions regarding sharing and use of documentation as the 
44bureau.
Page 10 - 129LR0034(01)-11Information from a source agency may also be used to update an individual's voter 
2registration.
3This bill exempts from liability an individual who is not qualified to be a registered 
4voter but who becomes a registered voter by operation of the automatic registration, as 
5long as that individual has not knowingly or willfully provided false information.
6This bill also requires the Secretary of State to adopt major substantive rules to 
7implement the new automatic voter registration system and submit those rules, along with 
8any proposed legislation necessary for the proper implementation of the new system, to 
9the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.
10Finally, this bill lowers the age at which a person may submit a conditional 
11registration to vote and enrollment in a political party from 17 years of age to 16 years of 
12age.
