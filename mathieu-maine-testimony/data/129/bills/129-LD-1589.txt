3CHAPTER 337-D
4MAINE LIBERTY ACT
5ยง4721.  Short title
6This chapter may be known and cited as "the Maine Liberty Act."
7ยง4722.  Legislative findings and purpose
8The Legislature finds and declares that immigrants are valuable and essential 
9members of the community of the State.  A relationship of trust between the State's 
10immigrant community and state and local agencies is central to the public safety and 
11well-being of the people of the State.  This trust is threatened when state and local 
12agencies are entangled with federal immigration enforcement programs, resulting in 
13immigrant community members being afraid to approach police when they are victims of 
14and witnesses to crimes, seek basic health services or attend school. The entanglement of 
15state and local agencies with federal immigration enforcement programs diverts limited 
16resources and blurs the lines of accountability between local, state and federal 
17governments.  State and local participation in federal immigration enforcement programs 
18also raises concerns under the United States Constitution, including the prospect that 
19residents of the State could be detained in violation of Amendment IV, targeted on the 
20basis of race or ethnicity in violation of the equal protection clause of Amendment XIV 
21or denied access to education based on immigration status.  This Act seeks to ensure 
22effective policing, protect the safety, well-being and constitutional rights of the people of 
23the State and direct the State's limited resources to matters of greatest concern to the State 
24and the local governments of the State.
