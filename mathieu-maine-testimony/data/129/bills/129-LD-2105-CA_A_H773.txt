E. "Visit" means any interaction between an enrollee and one or more providers for

2. Prohibition on balance billing. An out-of-network provider reimbursed for a 
surprise bill or a bill for covered emergency services under Title 24-A, section 4303-C, 
subsection 2, paragraph B or. if there is a dispute. under Title 24-A. section 4303-E may 
not bill an enrollee for health care services beyond the applicable coinsurance, 
copayment, deductible or other out-of-pocket cost expense that would be imposed for the 
health care services if the services were rendered by a network provider under the 
enrollee's health plan. For an enrollee subject to coinsurance, the out-of-network provider 
shall calculate the coinsurance amount based on the median network rate for that health 
care service under the enrollee's health plan. An out-of-network provider is also subiect 
to the following with respect to any overpayment made by an enrollee. 
A. If an out-of-network provider provides health care services covered under an 
enrollee's health plan and the out-of-network provider receives payment from the 
enrollee for health care services for which the enrollee is not responsible pursuant to 
this subsection. the out-of-network provider shall reimburse the enrollee within 30 
calendar days after the earlier of the date that the provider received notice of the 
overpayment and the date the provider became aware of the overpayment. 
B. An out-of-network provider that fails to reimburse an enrollee for an overpayment 
as required by paragraph A shall pay interest on the overpayment at the rate of 10% 
per annum beginning on the earlier of the date the provider received notice of the 
overpayment and the date the provider became aware of the overpayment. An 
enrollee is not required to request the accrued interest from the out-of-network 
provider in order to receive interest with the reimbursement amount. 
3, Uninsured patients; disputes of bHis. An uninsured patient who has received a 
bill for emergency services from a provider for one or more emergency health care 
services rendered during a single visit totaling $750 or more may dispute the bill and 
request resolution of the dispute using the process under Title 24-A. section 4303-E. The 
independent dispute resolution entity contracted to resolve the dispute over the surprise 
bill shall select either the out-of-network . provider's fee or the uninsured patient's 
proposed payment amount in accordance with Title 24-A. section 4303-E. An uninsured

patient who has insurance covering emergency services as determined using the method 
described in 26 Code of Federal Regulations. Section 1.S0l(r)-5, paragraph (b)(3) or 
(b)(4). A provider shall hold the uninsured patient harmless for the duration of the

payment and the out-of-network provider's fee, that a settlement between the carrier 
and out-of-network provider is reasonably likely, or that both the carrier's payment 
and the out-of-network provider's fee represent unreasonable extremes, the 
independent dispute resolution entity may direct both parties to attempt a good faith 
negotiation for settlement. The carrier and out-of-network provider may be granted 
up to 10 business days for this negotiation, which runs concurrently with the 30-day 
period for dispute resolution. 
E. The determination of an independent dispute resolution entity is binding on the 
carrier, out-of-network provider and enrollee and is admissible in any court 
proceeding between the carrier, out-of-network provider and enrollee or in any 
administrative proceeding between this State and the provider. 
F. When an independent dispute resolution entity determines the carrier's payment is 
reasonable, payment for the dispute resolution process is the responsibility of the out­
of-network provider. When the independent dispute resolution entity determines the 
out-of-network provider's fee is reasonable, payment for the dispute resolution 
process is the responsibility of the carrier. When a good faith negotiation directed by 
the independent dispute resolution entity results in a settlement between the carrier 
and the out-of-network provider, the carrier and the out-of-network provider shall 
evenly divide and share the prorated cost for dispute resolution. 
G. When the difference between the out-of-network provider's charge and the 
median network rate pursuant to section 4303-C, subsection 2. paragraph B. 
subparagraph (1). including any applicable enrollee cost sharing, is less than $750, a 
carrier shall reimburse the out-of-network provider directly for the provider's charges

percentile of charges for the particular health care service performed by a health care 
professional in the same or similar specialty and provided in the same geographical 
area as reported in a benchmarking database specified by the superintendent and 
maintained by a nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with and does not receive 
funding from a carrier. An out-of-network provider may dispute more than one bill 
with the same carrier for the same health care service under this subsection as long as 
the total of the bills with that carrier for that health care service exceeds $750. 
H. The superintendent shall enforce the determination of an independent dispute 
resolution entity pursuant to this subsection or any agreement made by a carrier and 
an out-of-network provider after the conclusion of the independent dispute resolution 
process pursuant to this subsection. The superintendent may use any powers provided 
to the superintendent under this Title.

Sec. 4. 24-A MRSA §4320-C, as amended by PL 2019, c. 238, §3, is further 
amended to read: 
§4320-C. Emergency services 
If a carrier offering a health plan provides or covers any benefits with respect to 
services in an emergency facility or setting, the plan must cover emergency services 
without prior authorization. Cost-sharing requirements, eJ(pressed such as a deductible, 
copayment amount or coinsurance rate, for out-of-network services are the same as 
requirements that would apply if such services were provided in network, and any 
payment made by an enrollee pursuant to this section must be applied to the enrollee's in­
network cost-sharing limit. The enrollee's responsibilit:( for payment for covered out-of­
network emergency services must be limited so that if the enrollee has paid the enrollee's 
share of the charge as specified in the plan for in-network services, the carrier shall hold 
the enrollee harmless from any additional amount owed to an out-of-network provider for 
covered emergency services and make payment to the out-of-network provider in 
accordance with section 4303-C or, if there is a dispute, in accordance with section 
4303-E. A carrier offering a health plan in this State shall also comply with the 
requirements of section 4304, subsection 5.

Emergency Medical Services' Board shall convene a stakeholder group, including the 
Maine Ambulance Association, representatives of municipal and private ambulance 
services, health insurance carriers and the Department of Professional and Financial 
Regulation, Bureau of Insurance, to review issues related to reimbursement rates for 
ambulance services. The stakeholder group shall:

16 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment amends the law providing 
17 consumer protection for surprise medical bills to include surprise bills for emergency 
18 services and also extends the same protections to bills for covered emergency services 
19 rendered by out-of-network providers. The amendment clarifies that consumers must be 
20 held harmless and not subject to balance billing for these services and specifies that 
21 consumers are responsible only for any applicable cost sharing determined as if the health 
22 care services were rendered by a network provider. 
23 In the event of a dispute with respect to only a surprise bill for emergency services or 
24 a bill for covered emergency services rendered by an out-of-network provider, the 
25 amendment directs the Superintendent of Insurance to develop an independent dispute 
26 resolution process to determine a reasonable payment for health care services beginning 
27 no later than October 1, 2020. 
28 The amendment requires the Emergency Medical Services' Board to convene a 
29 stakeholder group to review reimbursement rates for ambulance services. 
30 The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
