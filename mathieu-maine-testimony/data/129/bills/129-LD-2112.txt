29SUMMARY
30This bill prohibits the selling, leasing, renting, installing, use or entering into 
31commerce of any product or equipment that uses or will use a substance that is a 
32hydrofluorocarbon with high global warming potential intended for any air conditioning, 
33refrigeration, foam or aerosol propellant end use as determined by the Department of 
34Environmental Protection in rules.  It directs the department to adopt rules to implement 
35the prohibition and specifies the substances and end uses that are to be addressed in the 
36rules.  In adopting the initial rules, the department must regulate each substance and end 
37use as specifically provided for in the bill and may not regulate any substance or end use
