Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -State Employee Health Plan 
This bill would require the state employee health plan to cover all colorectal examinations and laboratory tests that are 
recommended by a provider in accordance with published guidelines. The health plan has indicated that this would 
require coverage of additional services not cunently offered by the plan. The health plan anticipates coverage of thest> 
additional services to cost $11,000 per fiscal year, but these costs would not have an impact on premiums. As a resuh, 
any additional costs to the health plan are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing resources.
