FffiST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 326, L.D. 417, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
an Attorney To Copy a Driver's License" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Allow an Attorney To Use a Photocopied Driver's License To 
Consummate a Financial Transaction' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 29-A MRSA ยง2103, sub-ยง4, 18, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 568, ยง1, is 
amended to read: 
B. A driver's license solely for proof of identification for the consummation of a 
financial transaction conducted by either the driver or the driver's attorney;' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. Current law authorizes the 
photocopying of a driver's license solely for proof of identification for the consummation 
of a financial transaction. The amendment revises current law to provide that either the 
driver or the driver's attorney can consummate a fmancial transaction using the 
photocopied driver's license for identification.
