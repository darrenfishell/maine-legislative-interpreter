SUMMARY 
This amendment makes the following changes to the process established in the bill 
for the issuance of licenses for the consumption of alcoholic beverages in entertainment 
districts. 
1. It provides that an entertainment district ordinance established by a municipal 
legislative body must describe the boundaries of the entertainment district as well as 
permissible hours of operation and maximum size of any common consumption area 
located within the entertainment district. The ordinance must also specify the maximum 
number of licensees that may operate a single common consumption area and whether a 
common consumption area located within the entertainment district may include public or 
private ways. 
2. It clarifies that an auditorium, hotel, restaurant, Class A restaurant, Class A 
restaurant/lounge or Maine manufacturer licensed under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
28-A to serve alcoholic beverages is eligible for a common consumption area license. An 
applicant's premises must be located both within the entertainment district and adjacent to 
the common consumption area. 
3. It specifies that a common consumption area license does not permit the licensee to 
serve alcoholic beverages that the licensee is not authorized to serve pursuant to the 
licensee's underlying liquor license. 
4. It clarifies that the customers of a common consumption area licensee may 
consume alcoholic beverages served by the licensee either on the licensee's premises or

This bill creates a common consumption area license that allows a licensed auditorium, hotel, restaurant, Class A 
restaurant or Class A restaurant/lounge or a manufacturer to operate a common consumption area for consuming 
alcohol within a designated entertainment district. Because of the limited applicability and specific criteria that must 
be met to apply, the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations does not anticipate a significant increase 
in costs or revenue related to the issuance of the new license.
