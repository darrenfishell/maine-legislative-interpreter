14dismantle or change state-owned track or contract with a state agency or private entity for 
15the dismantling of state-owned track or making other changes to that track for a nonrail

22matters prior to removal.
23The department may not convert a state-owned rail corridor in which the department 
24controls the right-of-way to a nonrail recreational and nonrecreational transportation use 
25without following the rail corridor use advisory council process established under section 
2675 and without legislative approval. If the Commissioner of Transportation receives a 
27report from a rail corridor use advisory council established under section 75 that includes 
28a recommendation of track removal or other change for nonrail use and the commissioner 
29concurs with that recommendation, the commissioner shall seek legislative approval of 
30the recommendation by submitting proposed legislation to the joint standing committee 
31of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior to removal or other 
32change for the proposed nonrail use. Legislation submitted under this section must 
33include language stating that any track removal or other change for nonrail use is 
34considered interim in nature and that the rail corridor will be preserved for future rail use 
35as provided under this chapter.' 
36Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
37section number to read consecutively.
