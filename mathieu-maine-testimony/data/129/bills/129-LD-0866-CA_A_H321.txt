Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill provides that, beginning in fiscal year 2020-21, each state postsecondary educational institution may award 
grants to eligible homeless students equal to the cost of tuition less all other financial aid received by the student, 
subject to funding provided by the Legislature. The cost of this provision can not be estimated at this time and will 
depend on the number of eligible homeless students, the cost of tuition and the amount of financial aid received by 
each student. The bill requires the University of Maine System (UMS), the Maine Community College System 
(MCCS) and the Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) to include the estimated amount of funding necessary to fully 
fund the grants as part of their biennial budget fonding request. 
Additional costs to the UMS, MCCS and MMA to provide a homeless student liaison to assist homeless students in 
applying for federal and state financial aid and to develop individual housing plans for homeless students who are 
enrolled as full-time students can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
