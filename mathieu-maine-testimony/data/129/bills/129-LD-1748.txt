25regulations regarding the privacy of consumer information, apply to all consumer 
26financial information obtained by the trust or municipalities or their designees in 
27implementing commercial PACE programs under this chapter.
28ยง10205.  Commercial PACE assessments; collection; priority
291.  Collection of assessments.  Commercial PACE assessments constitute a lien 
30against the qualifying property on which they are made until they are paid, and must be 
31assessed and collected by the trust, a 3rd-party administrator contracted by the trust, a 
32municipality or an agent designated by the trust or a municipality in any manner allowed 
33under the commercial PACE program, consistent with applicable laws.
342.  Notice; filing.  A notice of a commercial PACE agreement must be filed in the 
35appropriate registry of deeds. The filing of this notice creates a commercial PACE lien 
36against the property subject to the commercial PACE assessment until the amounts due 
37under the terms of the commercial PACE agreement are paid in full. A notice filed under 
38this subsection must, at a minimum, include:
Page 5 - 129LR1608(01)-11A.  The amount of funds disbursed or to be disbursed pursuant to the commercial 
2PACE agreement;
3B.  The names and addresses of the current owners of the qualifying property subject 
4to the commercial PACE assessment;
5C.  A description of the qualifying property subject to the commercial PACE 
6assessment, including its tax map and lot number;
7D.  The duration of the commercial PACE agreement;
8E.  The name and address of the entity filing the notice; and
9F.  Written verification of mortgage lender consent.
103.  Priority.  A commercial PACE assessment takes precedence over all other liens 
11or encumbrances except a lien for taxes of the municipality where the qualifying property 
12is located on real property, except that the precedence of such a commercial PACE 
13assessment over any lien held by an existing mortgage holder is subject to the written 
14consent of such existing mortgage holder.
154.  Mortgage lender notice and consent.  Any financial institution holding a lien, 
16mortgage or security interest in or other encumbrance on the property for which a 
17commercial PACE assessment is sought must be provided written notice of the 
18commercial property owner's intention to participate in the commercial PACE program 
19and acknowledge in writing to the commercial property owner and municipality that they 
20have received such notice.  A commercial PACE assessment may not be approved until 
21the financial institution holding the lien, mortgage or security interest in or other 
22encumbrance on the property has provided written consent to the commercial property 
23owner and municipality that the property may participate in the program.  This written 
24consent must be recorded in the registry of deeds.
255.  Acceleration not permitted.  A commercial PACE assessment runs with the 
26property in the same manner as a property tax lien. The portion of the assessment that has 
27not yet become due is not eliminated by foreclosure and the assessment cannot be 
28accelerated or extinguished until fully repaid.
296.  Judicial sale or foreclosure.  In the event of a judicial sale or foreclosure of a 
30property subject to a commercial PACE lien, all parties with mortgages or liens on that 
31property, including without limitation commercial PACE lien holders, must receive on 
32account of such mortgages or liens sale proceeds in accordance with the priority 
33established in this chapter and by applicable law.  A commercial PACE assessment is not 
34eliminated by foreclosure and cannot be accelerated.  Only the portion of a commercial 
35PACE assessment that is in arrears at the time of foreclosure takes precedence over other 
36mortgages or liens; the remainder transfers with the property at resale.
377.  Release of lien.  A municipality shall discharge a commercial PACE lien created 
38under subsection 2 upon full payment of the amount specified in the commercial PACE 
39agreement. The discharge of a commercial PACE lien under this subsection must be filed 
40with the appropriate registry of deeds.
Page 6 - 129LR1608(01)-11ยง10206.  Commercial property owners
21.  Purchase of goods and services.  A commercial property owner who has entered 
3into a commercial PACE agreement under this chapter may purchase directly all goods 
4and services for the energy savings improvements described in the commercial PACE 
5agreement, subject to vendor certification by the trust and other requirements of the trust.  
6Goods and services purchased by a commercial property owner for the energy savings 
7improvements under a commercial PACE agreement are not subject to any public 
8procurement ordinance or statute.
92.  Rights.  Commercial property owners retain all rights under contract or law 
10against parties other than the municipality or the trust with respect to energy savings 
11improvements financed through commercial PACE agreements.
12ยง10207.  Annual report
13The trust shall report annually on the implementation of this chapter as part of the 
14report required under section 10104, subsection 5.
15ยง10208.  Rulemaking
16Rules adopted under this chapter are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
17chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
18ยง10209.  Construction; home rule
19Nothing in this chapter may be construed to limit the home rule authority of a 
20municipality.
21ยง10210.  Conformity to changed standards
22If standards are adopted by any state or federal agency subsequent to a municipality's 
23adoption of a commercial PACE ordinance or participation in a commercial PACE 
24program and those standards substantially conflict with the municipality's manner of 
25participation in the commercial PACE program, the municipality shall take necessary 
26steps to conform its participation to those standards.
27SUMMARY
28This bill allows the Efficiency Maine Trust or a municipality to establish a 
29commercial property assessed clean energy program to finance energy savings 
30improvements on qualifying property.
