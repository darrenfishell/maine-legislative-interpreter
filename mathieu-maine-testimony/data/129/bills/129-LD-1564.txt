32performed by minorities, women and veterans;

34without regard to whether the employees of any such contractor are members of a 
35labor organization;
Page 2 - 129LR1165(01)-11F.  Permit the selection of the lowest responsible qualified bidder without regard to 
2labor organization affiliation; and
3G.  Bind all contractors and subcontractors to the terms of the agreement.
4A project labor agreement required by a public authority pursuant to this section may not 
5require compulsory labor organization membership of employees working on the public 
6works project.
74.  Bidder that does not agree to abide by conditions.  A bidder for a public works 
8project that does not agree to abide by the conditions of the project labor agreement or a 
9requirement to negotiate a project labor agreement may not be regarded as a responsible 
10qualified bidder for the project.
11SUMMARY
