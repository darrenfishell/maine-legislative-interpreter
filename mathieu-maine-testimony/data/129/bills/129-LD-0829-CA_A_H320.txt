Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $2,000 in fiscal year 2019-20. An estimated $6,120 is 
available in each of fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 in the Legislature's proposed budget for legislative studies as 
well as any balances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will 
depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Department of Corrections (DOC) to provide any necessary staffing assistance to the 
commission. Any costs to the DOC to staff the commission can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Any additional costs to the departments or agencies whose commissioners, directors or their designees are required to 
serve on the Commission To Improve Sentencing, Supervision, Management and Incarceration of Prisoners are 
assumed to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
