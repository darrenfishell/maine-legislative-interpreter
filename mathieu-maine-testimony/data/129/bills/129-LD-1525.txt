5SUMMARY
6This bill prohibits the owner of a motorboat of more than 75 horsepower from 
7operating or allowing operation of the motorboat in the inland or tidal waters of the State 
8without insurance on the motorboat similar to the financial responsibility provisions 
9regarding motor vehicles.  The bill requires the operator of the motorboat to provide 
10proof of insurance, which may be in an acceptable electronic format, to a law 
11enforcement officer upon request or, if the motorboat is in an accident, to all persons 
12involved in the accident. An operator of a motorboat who fails to provide proof of 
13insurance commits a civil penalty unless proof of insurance is produced before 
14adjudication of the violation, and an owner who fails to insure a motorboat that is then 
15involved in an accident commits a Class D crime.
