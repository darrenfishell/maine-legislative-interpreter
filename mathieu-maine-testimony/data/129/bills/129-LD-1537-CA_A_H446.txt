Increasing the portion 
of retirement benefits on which the cost-of-living adjustment is applied to will increase the 
unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System (MainePERS) by approximately 
$350 million. Pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 18-A, unfunded liabilities may not be created 
except those that result from experience losses. This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $249 .3 
million in fiscal year 2019-20 to the Retirement Allowance Fund program within MainePERS for its estimated share of 
the increase in the UAL. This bill also includes a Highway Fund allocation of $23 .4 million for its share of the cost. 
Federal Expenditures Fund, Other Special Revenue Funds and Federal Block Grant Fund allocations totaling $54.5 
million are also included in the bill. Various other funds totaling $22.8 million but not shown above will require 
allocation by financial order. 
This provision will also increase the normal cost component of the employer retirement rate by approximately $3.0 
million annually beginning in fiscal year 2021-22. The annual impact to the General Fund and Highway Fund is 
estimated to be $1.46 million and $349,000, respectively. The increase in costs to the Federal Expenditures Fund, 
Other Special Revenue Funds and the Federal Block Grant Fund total $858,000. Various other funds totaling $335,000 
but not shown above will require allocation by financial order.
