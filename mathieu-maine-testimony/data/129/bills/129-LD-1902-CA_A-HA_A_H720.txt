15 HOUSE AMENDMENT "A "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 654, L.D. 1902 
SUMMARY 
This amendment allows the unenrolled members of the Senate and the unenrolled 
members of the House of Representatives to elect a leader who may designate an 
unenrolled political action committee to promote the election of unenrolled candidates to 
that body of the Legislature. Like a caucus political action committee, an unenrolled 
political action committee may make unlimited donations to a candidate to fund a 
recount. In addition, although Maine Clean Election Act candidates are generally 
prohibited from serving as the treasurer, principal officer, primary fund-raiser or primary 
decision maker fo1· a political action committee, the amendment autho1izes Maine Clean 
Election Act candidates to engage in fund-raising or decision making for an unenrolled 
political action committee to the same extent that Maine Clean Election Act candidates 
may engage in such activities} a aucu~ political action committee.
