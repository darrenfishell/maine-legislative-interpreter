Page 1 - 129LR2224(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §681, sub-§5, ¶¶A and B, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 647, §3 
3and affected by §5, are amended to read:
4A.    Shareholder in a cooperative housing corporation that owns a homestead in this 
5State; and
6B.    Shareholder for the preceding 12 months in the cooperative housing corporation 
7specified in paragraph A; and
8Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §683, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 478, §1, is further 
9amended to read:
101.  Exemption amount.  Except for assessments for special benefits, the just value of 
11$10,000 of the homestead of a permanent resident of this State who has owned a 
12homestead in this State for the preceding 12 months is exempt from taxation.  
13Notwithstanding this subsection, a permanent resident of this State who loses ownership 
14of a homestead in this State due to a tax lien foreclosure and subsequently regains 
15ownership of the homestead from the municipality that foreclosed on the tax lien is 
16deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be determined ineligible 
17for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of the homestead by the 
18municipality.  In determining the local assessed value of the exemption, the assessor shall 
19multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current just value upon which the 
20assessment is based as furnished in the assessor's annual return pursuant to section 383.  
21If the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in common with others, the 
22exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the homestead, but may be 
23apportioned among the owners who reside on the property to the extent of their respective 
24interests.  A municipality responsible for administering the homestead exemption has no 
25obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest in a homestead owned 
26jointly or in common.
27SUMMARY
28This bill provides that a permanent resident of the State who owns a homestead in the 
29State does not need to own the homestead for the preceding 12 months in order to qualify 
30for the Maine resident homestead property tax exemption.
