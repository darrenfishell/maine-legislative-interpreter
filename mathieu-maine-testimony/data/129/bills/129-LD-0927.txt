2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the boating season begins in the State prior to the statutory adjournment 
4date; and
5Whereas, this Act is necessary to protect Maine's water bodies from invasive 
6aquatic plants; and
7Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
8the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
9immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
10therefore,
11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
12Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง419-C, sub-ยง1-A is enacted to read:
131-A.  Draining of vessels and equipment.  When removing a vessel from an inland 
14water body, and prior to transport away from the area where the vessel left the water, a 
15person shall:
16A.  Drain the vessel, trailer and other equipment that holds water, including live 
17wells, ballast tanks and bilges; and
18B.  Remove or open drain plugs, bailers, valves and other devices to drain the water 
19from the live wells, ballast tanks and bilges.
20For the purposes of this subsection, "vessel" has the same meaning as defined in section 
21542, subsection 11.
22Nothing in this subsection allows a person to directly or indirectly discharge pollutants 
23into waters of the State.  This subsection does not apply to emergency response vessels 
24and their related equipment.
25Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
26legislation takes effect when approved.
27SUMMARY
28This bill requires a person when removing a vessel from an inland water body to 
29drain the vessel and other equipment and to remove or open drain plugs, bailers, valves 
30and other devices to drain the water before that vessel is transported. It exempts 
31emergency response vessels from these requirements.
