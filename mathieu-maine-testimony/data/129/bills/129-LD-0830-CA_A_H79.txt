An Act To Balance Maine's Minimum Wage for Small and Large Employers 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 1/,,(/-1-11) 
Committee: Labor and Housing 
Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium savings -All funds 
Potential savings to municipalities 
Current law requires the $11.00 per hour minimum wage to increase to $12.00 per hour on January 1, 2020 and by the 
percent increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) annually beginning on January 1, 2021. This bill delays the 
increase until January 1, 2021 and specifies that these provisions apply only to employers that employ at least 50 fullÂ­
time employees in the State. This delay may result in savings to the State and municipalities that employ at least 50 
full-time employees beginning in fiscal year 2019-20, depending on the wages currently in place and decisions on 
future wages when increases required by law are less than they would have been under current law. 
This bill also reduces the minimum wage for employers that employ less than 50 full-time employees in the State from 
$11.00 per hour that is currently in place to $10.00 per hour effective October 1, 2019. This wage will remain in 
place until January 1, 2022 when it will be increased by the percent increase in the CPI. This change in the minimum 
wage law may result in savings to those municipalities that employ fewer than 50 full-time employees beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20, depending on the wages currently in place and decisions made by municipalities on future wages 
when increases required by law are less than they would have been under current law.
