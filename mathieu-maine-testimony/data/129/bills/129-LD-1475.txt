11SUMMARY
12This bill creates the Act To Eliminate Profiling in Maine, which establishes policies 
13and procedures for law enforcement officers and law enforcement agencies to prohibit 
14and eliminate profiling.  The bill defines profiling as the discriminatory practice of a law 
15enforcement officer or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on actual or 
16perceived race, gender, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, ancestry or national 
17origin in targeting an individual for routine or spontaneous investigatory activities or in 
18deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement activity following the initial 
19investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy information, relevant to the 
20locality and time frame, that links a person with a particular characteristic to an identified 
21criminal incident or scheme.
22Specifically, the bill directs the Board of Trustees of the Maine Criminal Justice 
23Academy to establish policies and procedures to eliminate profiling and require 
24mandatory training and anti-profiling education by all law enforcement agencies in the 
25State.  All law enforcement agencies must adopt written policies on profiling.  The bill 
26requires law enforcement agencies to implement procedures for receiving, investigating 
27and responding to complaints of profiling.  The bill also directs the Attorney General to 
28adopt rules and guidelines for collecting and reporting data regarding profiling.  Rules 
29must define what data must be collected, how it must be collected and how the data may 
30be reported and used to eliminate profiling and inform law enforcement, the public and 
31the joint standing committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters 
32and criminal justice and public safety matters.
