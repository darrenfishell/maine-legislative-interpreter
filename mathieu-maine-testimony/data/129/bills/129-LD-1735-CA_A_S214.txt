Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Public Law 2017, chapter 452 authorized registered dispensaries under the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act 
operating as nonprofit entities to become for-profit entities, but did not outline a pathway to follow for such a 
transition. This bill specifies the possible pathways of merger, purchase and conversion for a dispensary to become a 
for-profit entity. This includes that a registered dispensary pay to the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund (MUMF) a 
percentage of the value of the sale or transfer of interest if a sale occurs within 4 years of becoming for-profit and that 
the appraisal to identify the sale or transfer value must be paid by the MUMF. It is unknown if any of the 8 eligible 
dispenseries would transfer to for-profit status and if so whether they would sell within 4 years. It is expected that any 
proceeds to the MUMF from such activity would outweigh the cost of the required appraisals and lead to a significant 
increase in revenue.
