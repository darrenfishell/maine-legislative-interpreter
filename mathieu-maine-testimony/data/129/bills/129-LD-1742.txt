17operating and managing broadband service networks serving residential 
18customers;
19(2)  A description of the project area, including a list of census blocks covered by 
20the proposed project.  If a census block included in an application already is 
21partially served by a provider of broadband service, the application must describe 
22the portions of the census block that are already served and the portions of the 
23census block that constitute an unserved area or underserved area and must 
24include a certification that none of the grant funding provided by the program for 
25the project proposed in the application will be used to extend or deploy facilities 
26to a household that is already served by a provider of broadband service;

21service or other communications service to residential customers within the State may 
22submit a competing application for a grant for a project in any proposed project area 
23that is the subject of an application submitted by or on behalf of a municipality.  In 
24reviewing competing applications in any such project area, the authority shall give 
25preference to the application submitted by a nongovernmental entity covering the 
26project area, whether during the annual period for submission of applications 
27established pursuant to subsection 5, paragraph A or through the competing 
28application process authorized in this paragraph.
29D.  In reviewing applications and any accompanying challenges, the authority shall 
30conduct its own review of the proposed project areas to ensure that all awarded grants 
31are used to deploy advanced communications technology infrastructure to unserved 
32areas.  The authority may not award any grants to fund a project for any proposed 
33project area that fails to meet the criteria for being unserved.
34E.  The authority shall award grants for projects set forth in applications based upon a 
35scoring system.  The scoring system must be released to the public at least 30 days 
36prior to the period for submission of applications established pursuant to subsection 
375, paragraph A.  The scoring system must give the highest weight or priority to the 
38following factors:
39(1)  The size and scope of the unserved area or underserved area proposed to be 
40served;
41(2)  The experience, technical ability and financial means of the applicant in 
42successfully deploying and providing broadband service;
Page 6 - 129LR1679(01)-11(3) The length of time the applicant has been providing broadband service in the 
2State;
3(4)  The extent to which government funding support is necessary to deploy 
4advanced communications technology infrastructure in an economically feasible 
5manner in the proposed project area;
6(5)  The amount and proportion of the matching funds proposed to be committed 
7by the applicant;
8(6)  Whether the proposed project area is an unserved area, rather than an 
9underserved area;
10(7)  The service speed thresholds proposed in the application and the scalability 
11of the advanced communications technology infrastructure proposed to be 
12deployed to speeds higher than 25 megabits per second from the broadband 
13service provider to the customer and 3 megabits per second from the customer to 
14the broadband service provider;
15(8)  The applicant's ability to leverage nearby or adjacent advanced 
16communications technology infrastructure to facilitate the proposed project and 
17provision of service to households;
18(9)  The extent to which the proposed project does not duplicate any existing 
19advanced communications technology infrastructure in the proposed project area; 
20and
21(10)  Such other factors the authority determines to be reasonable and 
22appropriate, consistent with the purpose of facilitating the economic deployment 
23of advanced communications technology infrastructure to unserved areas.
24F.  In awarding grants, the authority may not include consideration of any new or 
25additional regulatory obligations beyond those required under applicable law, 
26including, but not limited to, open access network requirements or any rate, service or 
27other obligations beyond the speed requirements set forth in section 9202, subsection 
2810.  In awarding grants, the authority may not include consideration of factors that 
29would constrain a recipient from offering or providing broadband service in the same 
30manner as such service is offered without funding support by the broadband service 
31provider in other areas of the State.
32G.  An applicant must be afforded a reasonable time frame to complete a project 
33selected for funding approval.
347.  Implementation.  The following provisions govern the implementation of the 
35program.
36A.  The authority shall adopt rules within 180 days of the effective date of this section 
37consistent with this section that implement the requirements of this section and 
38govern the submission, review and approval of applications and the administration of 
39projects funded under this section, including rules for grant agreements 
40memorializing the award of funds.
41B.  Rules that implement this section must include reasonable oversight and reporting 
42provisions to ensure that grants are used as intended.  Such rules may not include 3rd-
Page 7 - 129LR1679(01)-11party audit requirements, letter of credit or performance bond obligations or financial 
2penalty or liquidated damages provisions or provisions that are not reasonably related 
3to the deployment of advanced communications technology infrastructure by an 
4applicant in accordance with the purposes and provisions of this section. Nothing in 
5this paragraph precludes the authority from requiring disgorgement of grant funds in 
6response to an applicant's pattern of failure, following notice and an opportunity to 
7cure, to build out a project area in accordance with the time frames and timetables set 
8forth in its application.
9C.  Nothing in this section may be construed to preclude the authority from 
10considering an applicant's financial ability to complete the project proposed in an 
11application or making reasonable requests for information necessary for the oversight 
12and administration of a project funded under this section.
13D.  Nothing in this section may be construed to empower the authority to adopt rules 
14or to impose any obligations or requirements on funding recipients, through grant 
15agreements or any other mechanism, other than the program implementation rules 
16expressly authorized in paragraph A.
17E.  The provisions of this section supersede any contrary rules adopted prior to the 
18effective date of this section by the authority to govern the disbursement of funds to 
19support broadband investment.
20SUMMARY
21This bill facilitates the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved areas of 
22this State by establishing the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Program under the 
23ConnectME Authority to award grants to applicants for the purpose of extending 
24deployment of facilities used to provide broadband service to unserved areas of the State 
25and thus to encourage new investment in broadband service infrastructure.  The bill 
26eliminates the Municipal Gigabit Broadband Network Access Fund.  The bill removes the 
27authority of the ConnectME Authority to require communications service providers to 
28contribute to the ConnectME Fund.  It allows the authority to issue bonds for the 
29construction of advanced communications technology infrastructure.
