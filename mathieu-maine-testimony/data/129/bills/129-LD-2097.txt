Page 2 - 129LR2767(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill establishes requirements for the approval of construction of elective 
3transmission lines when the party seeking approval from the Public Utilities Commission 
4is a transmission and distribution utility.   The bill defines "elective transmission line" as 
5a transmission line that is not being constructed primarily for reliability purposes or to 
6serve retail customers in the State.  In addition to meeting the existing requirements in 
7law for approval of a transmission line, a transmission and distribution utility petitioning 
8for commission approval for an elective transmission line is required to demonstrate:
91.  That the petitioner provided equal access to rights-of-way and data and 
10information about the petitioner's transmission system to any person seeking to compete 
11with the petitioner to construct the transmission line; and
122.  That the proposed elective transmission line either will not use ratepayer-funded 
13assets or will use ratepayer-funded assets and the petitioner made these assets available 
14on equal terms to any person seeking to compete with the petitioner to construct the 
15transmission line and agrees to provide a benefit to ratepayers in the State of equal value, 
16as determined by the commission, to the ratepayer-funded assets used to construct the 
17transmission line.
