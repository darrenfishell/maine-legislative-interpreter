7 direction of the Governor, to issue bonds  in the name  and on behalf of the State in an 
8 amount not exceeding $50,000,000 for the purposes described in section  5 of this Act.  
9 The bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for 
10 a period  longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of  the bonds.
11 Sec. 2.  Records  of bonds  issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer  of State 
12 shall ensure  that an account  of each bond is kept showing the number  of the bond, the 
13 name of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of 
14 sale and  the date  when payable.
15 Sec. 3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.   The Treasurer of State 
16 may negotiate  the sale of the bonds  by direction  of the Governor, but no bond may be

18 bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer  of State 
19 upon warrants  drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely  for the purposes set 
20 forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion  of the 
21 projects in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer  of State to be used for the 
22 retirement of general  obligation bonds.
