A. Members of the family or families that established the cemetery, their 
descendants or others as chosen by the members of the family or families that

The existence of an ancient burying ground may be established in accordance with 
section 1101-B. subsection 3.

A lack of documentation of an ancient burying ground as described in this subsection 
may not disprove the existence of an ancient burying ground if there is physical evidence 
of its existence. 
A lack of apparent marked boundaries of an ancient burying ground may not disprove the 
existence of an ancient burying ground. 
Sec. 4. 13 MRSA §1101-D, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 700, §2, is amended to 
read: 
§1101-D. Unorganized townships 
If an ancient burying ground or a public burying ground as described in section 1101 
is located in an unorganized township, the county in which the township is located is 
subject to sections 1101, 1101-B and 1101-C except that the county is not reguired to 
designate a caretaker by a writing as required in section 1101. subsection 1.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It adds descendants of veterans buried in ancient 
burying grounds within the municipalities to the list of entities and persons with whom a 
municipality collaborates when keeping veterans' graves in ancient burying grounds in 
good condition. This amendment clarifies that a municipally designated caretaker, but 
not a caretaker designated by a county, must be designated pursuant to a writing signed 
by the municipal officers. This amendment changes the definition of "ancient burying 
ground." This amendment permits the existence of an ancient burying ground to be 
documented through a variety of papers or through physical evidence.
