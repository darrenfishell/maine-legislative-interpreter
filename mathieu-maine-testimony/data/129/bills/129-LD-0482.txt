35SUMMARY
36This bill changes the requirements for a municipality to withdraw from a regional 
37school unit following a vote on a withdrawal agreement. Current law requires that the 
38total number of votes cast for and against withdrawal equal or exceed 50% of the total 
Page 2 - 129LR0754(01)-11votes cast in the municipality for Governor in the last gubernatorial election. This bill 
2requires instead that the number of votes cast in favor of withdrawal equal or exceed 25% 
3of the total votes cast in the municipality for Governor in the last gubernatorial election. 
4A majority vote in favor of withdrawal is still required, and a 2/3 vote in favor of 
5withdrawal is still required if the municipality is part of a school administrative district 
6that was reformulated as a regional school unit pursuant to the school unit consolidation 
7laws.
8This bill also changes the requirements for a new municipal charter, charter revision, 
9charter modification or charter amendment in a question before the voters to go into 
10effect. Current law requires that the total number of votes cast for and against the 
11question equal or exceed 30% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the last 
12gubernatorial election. This bill requires instead that the number of votes cast in favor of 
13the proposed change equal or exceed 15% of the total votes cast in the municipality in the 
14last gubernatorial election and clarifies that this means votes cast for Governor in that 
15election. Also, while this bill does not change the requirement that a majority of votes 
16cast for and against the proposed change be in favor of it in order for that change to go 
17into effect, it clarifies that blank votes are not counted in that calculation.
18This bill also changes the requirements for a deorganization of a municipality to go 
19into effect following a vote on final approval. Current law requires that the total number 
20of votes cast for and against deorganization must equal or exceed 50% of the total votes 
21cast in the municipality for Governor in the last gubernatorial election in order for the 
22deorganization to go into effect. This bill requires instead that the number of votes cast in 
23favor of deorganization must equal or exceed 1/3 of the total votes cast in the 
24municipality for Governor in the last gubernatorial election. Also, while this bill retains 
25the requirement that the deorganization be approved by 2/3 of the voters in order for it to 
26go into effect, it clarifies that that means 2/3 of those voting for or against deorganization 
27in that election.
