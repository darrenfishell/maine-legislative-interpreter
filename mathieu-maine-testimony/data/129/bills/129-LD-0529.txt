14SUMMARY
15This bill reinstates the State's property tax deferral program, which was in effect for 
16applications filed before April 1, 1991.  The bill modifies the program to include 
17households with at least one individual who is 65 years of age or older or who retired 
18from gainful employment due to physical disability and to surviving spouses who are at 
19least 60 years of age and provides that household income must be less than $40,000.  This 
20limit is indexed for inflation in 2020 and annually thereafter.
21This bill limits the total amount of property taxes that a taxpayer may defer to 80% of 
22the taxpayer's equity in the property and requires the Finance Authority of Maine to 
23establish a loan program to ensure adequate funding of reimbursements to municipalities.
