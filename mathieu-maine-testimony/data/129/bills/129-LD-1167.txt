24foodstuffs, including milk or milk products, eggs, meat or meat products, poultry or 
25poultry products, fish or fish products and fruits and vegetables, that must be purchased, 
26requiring at least 20% by December 31, 2025, at least 30% by December 31, 2030, at 
27least 40% by December 31, 2040 and at least 50% by December 31, 2050.  The bill 
28exempts from the requirements school purchasers at schools participating in the National

30processors, revises provisions regulating quality standards and requires competitive 
31bidding when more than one producer or broker or wholesaler can supply a given
