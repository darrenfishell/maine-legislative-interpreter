COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A "to H.P. 891, L.D. 1230 
1 Amend the bill in section 8 in §4042 in subsection 2 in the 4th line (page 2, line 26 in 
2 L.D.) by striking out the following: "After" and inserting the following: 'If ownership of 
3 the stray livestock is not claimed by any person, after' 
4 Amend the bill in section 8 in §4042 by inserting at the end a new paragraph to read: 
5 'For purposes of this section, "livestock" does not include feral swine or domesticated 
6 cervids.' 
7 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
8 section number to read consecutively. 
9 SUMMARY 
10 This amendment retains the current law that provides that, if a service dog has not 
11 been previously registered or licensed by a municipal clerk, the clerk may not register the 
12 dog nor issue to its owner or keeper a license unless the applicant presents written 
13 evidence to the municipal clerk that the dog meets the defmition of "service dog." The 
14 amendment removes the requirement that the municipal clerk issue to the dog's owner or 
15 keeper a tag that identifies the dog as a service dog. 
16 The amendment clarifies that a municipality, veterinarian, humane agent, animal 
17 control officer or animal shelter is not civilly liable to any party for authorization of 
18 euthanasia of severely sick or severely injured livestock if certain conditions are met nor 
19 is any person petforming euthanasia under that authorization. 
20 The amendment adds the intent to harm or intoxicate the animal to the bill's addition 
21 to the animal cruelty provisions of the violation of giving a scheduled drug to an animal. 
22 The amendment strikes from the bill the provision that makes the violation of a court 
23 order involving a civil animal welfare matter a Class D crime. 
24 The amendment clarifies under the provision establishing municipal procedures for 
25 the handling of stray livestock that "livestock" does not include feral swine or 
26 domesticated cervids. 
27 The fiscal note on the bill identifies certain requirements in the bill, which are 
28 retained in the amendment, as a potential state mandate. In order to be a mandate 
29 pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, a provision must require a local unit of 
30 government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
31 from local revenue. The committee finds the provisions identified as a potential state 
32 mandate do not require a local unit government to expand or modify its activities in a 
33 manner so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. 
34 Under current law, pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 7, section 3948, 
35 subsection 3, municipalities are required to control domesticated animals that are a cause 
36 of complaint in the community. Additionally, municipalities are required to control 
37 animals that pose a threat to public health or safety. This section oflaw also provides that 
38 a municipality may control undomesticated animals in matters no other department is 
39 charged by law to regulate. 
40 The bill repeals and amends certain provisions under Title 33, chapter 21 relating to 
41 lost goods and stray beasts. The bill repeals the requirement that the fmder of a stray

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A" to H.P. 891, L.D. 1230 
1 beast, potentially a municipality, keep a stray beast for up to 6 months. The bill requires 
2 a municipality to follow certain procedures related to stray livestock, but a municipality is 
3 only required to retain custody for 10 days. The committee feels that this could 
4 potentially result in a savings for a municipality faced with this scenario.

Committee: Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential State Mandate -Unfunded 
State Mandates 
Required Activity Unit Affected 
Municipalities will be required to follow certain procedures related to stray Municipality 
livestock, including: to seize, impound or restrain stray livestock, deliver livestock 
to a facility capable of containing them, arrange for safe confinement, retain 
custody for 10 days, provide food, shelter and medical care, take ownership after 10 
days or convey ownership to an animal shelter. Local Cost 
Insignificant 
limited scope 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the 
bill does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional 
expenditures from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) 
General Fund appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the 
mandate; or (2) a Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to 
exempt the mandate from the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these 
actions occurs, the local units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
While the bill imposes new procedures on municipalities that may add new costs, it also eliminates other procedures 
that were costly for municalities. In particular, Title 33, § 1057 required a finder, potentially a municipality, to keep a 
stray beast for 2 months before selling and up to 6 months if it did not sell it. This bill requires a holding period of 
only 10 days.
