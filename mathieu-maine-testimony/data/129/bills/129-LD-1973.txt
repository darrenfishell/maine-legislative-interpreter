6chair and a secretary.  It allows municipal officers to appoint alternate commissioners 
7when necessary to ensure a quorum for voting purposes.  It allows the commission to 
8establish ad hoc committees and to appoint members to those committees that are not 
9members of the commission.
10It changes the duties and powers of the commission to include developing an open 
11area plan; assisting in drafting the municipality's comprehensive plan; advising any 
12municipal reviewing authority in its deliberation related to effects on the municipality's 
13environment and natural resources; educating community members; and developing and 
14recommending to bodies politic a program for the better use of open areas.
15It repeals the provision that addressed park commissions established under previous 
16law.
