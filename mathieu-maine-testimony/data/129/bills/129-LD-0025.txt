28SUMMARY
29This bill implements recommendations of the Government Oversight Committee 
30based on the report on the Maine State Lottery issued by the Office of Program 
31Evaluation and Government Accountability in April 2017. The bill removes a provision 
32of law that requires the Director of the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
33Operations within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services to certify 
34certain financial information related to lottery operations to the Treasurer of State 
35monthly. The bill modifies the director's annual reporting requirements related to lottery 
36operations.  It requires the director to submit an annual report to the Governor and the 
37joint standing committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over lottery matters and 
38appropriations and financial affairs.  The report must include specific information on 
39lottery activities and finances and marketing and advertising efforts and a listing of 
40decisions made by the State Liquor and Lottery Commission and actions taken as a result.
Page 4 - 129LR0201(01)-11 The bill also amends several provisions related to monthly certification and annual 
2reporting requirements related to administration of the State's spirits business and the 
3bureau's oversight of the manufacture, distribution and sale of liquor in the State to make 
4them consistent with the bill's proposed requirements for lottery operations reporting.  
5Finally, the bill authorizes the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
6jurisdiction over lottery and alcoholic beverage matters to submit legislation based on the 
7reports required to be submitted by the director.
