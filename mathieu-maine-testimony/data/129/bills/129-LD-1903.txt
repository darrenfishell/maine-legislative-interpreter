7SUMMARY
8This bill repeals provisions of law governing signature gathering and other activities 
9at polling places on election day and enacts provisions in their place.  It requires a 6-foot-
10wide access corridor from the entrance to the polling place to the guardrail enclosure 
11where voting takes place that must be kept open at all times for the sole purpose of 
12allowing voters to pass through.  It designates a wider campaign-free zone of up to 150 
13feet outside the entrance to the voting place where activities on public property relating to 
14any campaign for a candidate or ballot question in that election year are restricted. The 
15bill clarifies those restrictions.  Collecting signatures on petitions for direct initiatives, 
16people's veto referenda and municipal referenda may be permitted by the election warden 
17inside the voting place and within the 150-foot zone but outside the 6-foot-wide access 
18corridor, to the extent space allows.   The bill removes the provision making any violation 
19of the laws governing political activities at the polling place a Class E crime.  It directs 
20the Secretary of State to issue guidelines to assist local election officials, candidates, 
21campaigns and the public in interpreting and applying these restrictions.
