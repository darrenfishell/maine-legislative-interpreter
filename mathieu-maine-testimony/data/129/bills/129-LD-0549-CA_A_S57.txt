Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill requires a public school participating in the Nati<?nal School Lunch Program to provide lunch to all students 
who are eligible for free and reduced-price meals at no co~t to the students. The estimated cost to fund the difference 
between the federal reimbursements for reduced-price and free lunches is $669,788 in fiscal year 2019-20 and 
$584,483 in fiscal year 2020-21. Of the fiscal year 2019-20 amount, approximately $100,000 is associated with the 
one-time cost to modify the existing school meal software application to accommodate this change. 
LD 1001, the Governor's proposed budget for the 2020-2021 biennium includes General Fund appropriations to the 
School Finance and Operations program within the Department of Education to fully fund this initiative, thus no 
funding is provided in this bill. However, if the funding is not included in the final budget approved by the 
Legislature, the fiscal note for this bill will need to be revised to include the General Fund appropriations necessary 
to fund the costs of this provision.
