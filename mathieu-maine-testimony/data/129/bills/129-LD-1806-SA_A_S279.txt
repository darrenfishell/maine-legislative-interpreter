FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 1286, L.D. 1806, Bill, "An Act To Amend 
the Laws Governing Veterans' Services" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 5 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 5. 37-B MRSA §505, sub-§2, ,rF, as amended by PL 2013, c. 569, §3, is 
further amended to read: 
F. A child of a veteran who is attending state-supported postsecondary vocational 
schools or institutions of collegiate grade must be admitted free of tuition including 
mandatory fees and lab fees for associate certificate programs, associate degree 
programs and bachelor's degree programs. The tuition waiver provided under this 
paragraph may not exceed the cost of 120 undergraduate credit hours at the in-state 
tuition rate at the University of Maine campus located at Orono and may be reduced 
by an amount necessary to ensure that the value of this waiver, combined with all 
other grants and benefits received by the student, does not exceed the total cost of 
education. Room and board may not be waived. A child of a veteran has e 10 
academic years from the date of first entrance to complete 120 credit hours. For 
degree programs that require more than 120 credit hours, the state-supported 
postsecondary vocational school or institution of collegiate grade may grant a tuition 
waiver beyond 120 credit hours. If such a waiver is granted, the state-supported 
postsecondary vocational school or institution of collegiate grade shall notify the 
director. The director may waive the limit of e 10 consecutive academic years when 
the recipient's education has been interrupted by severe medical disability, learning 
disability, illness or other hardship, making continued attendance impossible, 
hov;ever, the ~ctension may not exceed 2 academic years. Students must maintain at 
least a 2.0 or "C" grade point average to continue receiving educational benefits. If a 
student's grade point average falls below 2.0 or a "C," then the student has one 
semester to bring the grade point average up to at least 2.0 or a "C." If after that 
semester the student's grade point average is below 2.0 or a "C," the student loses 
educational benefits under this paragraph until the student achieves a grade point 
average of at least 2.0 or a "C." ' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively.

Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Reduces loss of tuition revenue -Higher educational institutions 
The amendment removes master's degree programs from the types of programs that a child of a veteran attending state­
supported postsecondary institutions may receive a tuition waiver for under the bill. Eliminating this provision from 
the bill will reduce the amount of tuition that may be lost to the state-supported higher educational institutions. As 
amended, the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System will be able to accommodate 
the reduced level of revenue loss without requiring additional resources.
