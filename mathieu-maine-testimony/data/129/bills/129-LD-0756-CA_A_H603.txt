Current biennium cost increase -All Funds 
Current biennium cost increase -local units of government 
This bill makes changes to several laws related to workers' compensation benefits including 1) adding fringe and other 
benefits to the determination of the average weekly wage under certain conditions as long as it does not result in a 
weekly benefit greater than 2/3 of 125% of the state average weekly wage at the time of injury; 2) increasing the 
maximum weekly benefit from 100% to 125% of the state average weekly wage; 3) providing a cost-of-living 
adjustment in cases of total incapacity after 260 weeks of benefits; 4) extending the duration that benefits may be 
received for cases of partial incapacity from 520 weeks to 624 weeks; and 5) providing that an employer must pay 
benefits to parents of a deceased employee for 500 weeks if the deceased employee has no dependents. 
These provisions will increase the workers' compensation costs for all employers. The additional costs cannot be 
estimated at this time and will be reflected in future workers' compensation rates. 
The fiscal impact on the State as a direct reimbursement employer and to local units of government will depend on 
actual experience.
