5SUMMARY
6This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, adds capital 
7improvements and equipment purchases of career and technical education centers and 
8regions to the definition of "project, projects or part of any project" in the Maine 
9Governmental Facilities Authority Act and to the authority to lease or rent any land, 
10buildings, structures, facilities or equipment. The amendment also adds equipment 
11purchases as a purpose for issuing additional securities, allows the Maine Governmental 
12Facilities Authority to delegate certain powers to the cooperative board or school 
13administrative unit that governs a career and technical education region or center, 
14respectively, and provides that the Maine Governmental Facilities Authority may not 
15issue any additional securities pursuant to this provision after June 30, 2022. The 
16amendment also authorizes the Department of Education to allocate the funds pursuant to 
17the national industry standards for career and technical education. The amendment 
18requires the Maine Governmental Facilities Authority to report to the joint standing 
19committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over education and cultural affairs upon 
20the allocation of all bond proceeds. The joint standing committee of the Legislature 
21having jurisdiction over education and cultural affairs may report out a bill to repeal the 
22provision regarding the issuance of additional securities and any other provision of law 
23relating to that provision. The amendment also provides that the executive director of the 
24Maine Governmental Facilities Authority must report to the joint standing committee of 
25the Legislature having jurisdiction over education and cultural affairs no later than 
26January 15, 2021 if the authority determines that additional legislation is necessary to 
27carry out the purposes of this legislation, including but not limited to any legislation 
28necessary to ensure that securities issued pursuant to this legislation are tax-exempt.
29Career and technical education centers and regions are without sufficient funds to 
30provide for capital improvements and equipment purchases and as such require additional 
31mechanisms to raise funds for this purpose.  It is the intent of this legislation to provide a 
32limited alternative mechanism for career and technical education centers and regions to 
33fund capital improvements and equipment purchases at career and technical education 
34centers and regions to better serve the State's students.

Fiscal Detail and Notes129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
Any additional costs to the Maine Governmental Facilities Au thority to review applications and set up debt service 
payment schedules are expected to be minor and can  be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The Department of Education has indi cated that, depending on the number of applications submitted and approved, it 
may require additional staff to adminster the application pro cess and the debt service payment schedule.  If additional 
resources are needed, the department will submit a request  through the biennial or supplemental budget process.Requiring the State to pay the debt service costs for up to $20 million in bonds issued by the Maine Governmental 
Facilities Authority to career and technical education cente rs and career and technical education regions for capital 
improvements and equipment purchases will result in increased costs to the General Fund.  The total cost to the State 
will depend on the number of projects approved and the princi pal and interest cost for each project.  Given the amount 
of time it may take for an application to be submitted a nd approved and for bonds to be issued, this fiscal note 
assumes that the debt service costs will not  impact the State until the 2022-2023 biennium.  Future biennium cost increase - General FundAn Act To Fund Capital Improvements to  Career and Technical Education Centers
