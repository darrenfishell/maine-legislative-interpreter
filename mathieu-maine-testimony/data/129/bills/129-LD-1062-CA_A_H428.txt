Fiscal Note 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide nonemergency medical 
transportation for a parent or guardian of a MaineCare member under 18 years of age to and from a residential care 
facility when the member is an inpatient at a residential care facility and no other means of transportation is available 
to the parent or guardian, so long as this transpo1iation is eligible for federal matching funds. The bill also requires the 
DHHS to apply for any necessmy Medicaid waivers or submit any state plan amendments (SP A) to receive federal 
matching Medicaid funds for transportation of parents or guardians, as outlined above. These trips will be contingent 
upon a waiver or SP A approval by the federal government, as these trips are currently not eligible in the MaineCare 
program. As it is not known how many trips a parent or guardian would make without the child in the car, no estimate 
of this contingent impact is made at this time.
