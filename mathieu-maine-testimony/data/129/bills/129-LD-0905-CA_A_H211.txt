Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill allows certain taxpayers an income tax deduction for certain long-term capital gains related to securities held 
for at least 10 years after October 1, 2019. Fiscal year 2029-30 would be the first year state revenue would be reduced. 
No estimate is made of the future revenue loss to the General Fund and the Local Goverment Fund at this time. 
However, for comparison purposes, if all gains on qualified assets held 10 years or more and realized by eligible 
taxpayers in tax year 2020 were exempt, the revenue reduction would be in the $3 million range.
