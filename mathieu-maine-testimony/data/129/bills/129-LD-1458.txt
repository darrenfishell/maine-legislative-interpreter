29an agency entering into a privatization contract shall, in consultation with the 
30Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services, follow the requirements of this 
31section.
322.  Written statement of services; sealed bids; contract terms.  An agency shall 
33prepare a specific written statement of the services proposed to be the subject of a 
34privatization contract, including the specific quantity and standard of quality of the 
35subject services. The agency shall solicit competitive sealed bids for the privatization 
36contracts based upon this statement. The day designated by the agency upon which it will 
37accept these sealed bids must be the same for all parties. The statement of services is a 
38public record and must be filed in the agency and with the Commissioner of 
39Administrative and Financial Services and transmitted to the Attorney General for review 
40pursuant to section 483. The term of a privatization contract may not exceed 5 years. A 
Page 3 - 129LR1091(01)-11privatization contract may not be amended for the purpose or effect of avoiding a 
2requirement of this section.
33.  Wage rate and benefits for employees in bids for privatization and 
4privatization contracts.  For each position for which a bidder under subsection 2 will 
5employ a person pursuant to the privatization contract and for which the duties are 
6substantially similar to the duties performed by a regular agency employee or employees, 
7the statement required by subsection 2 must include a statement of the minimum wage 
8rate to be paid for the position. The minimum wage rate must be the lowest classification

11Administrative and Financial Services from data collected by the Department of

19comparable to the coverage provided by the State for state employees for every employee 
20employed for not less than 20 hours per week pursuant to the contract and for a dependent 
21of the employee. A contractor shall submit quarterly payroll records to the agency, listing 
22the name, address, social security number, hours worked and hourly wage paid for each 
23employee in the previous quarter. The Attorney General may bring a civil action for 
24equitable relief in the Superior Court to enforce this subsection or to prevent or remedy 
25the dismissal, demotion or other action prejudicing any employee as a result of a report of 
26a violation of this subsection.
274.  Offers of employment to terminated state employees.  A privatization contract 
28must contain a provision requiring the contractor to offer available employee positions 
29pursuant to the contract to qualified regular employees of the agency whose state 
30employment is terminated because of the privatization contract and who satisfy the hiring 
31criteria of the contractor. A privatization contract must contain provisions requiring the 
32contractor to comply with a policy of, and to take affirmative steps to provide, 
33nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for any person protected by chapter 337.
345.  Estimate of subject services.  An agency seeking to enter into a privatization 
35contract shall prepare a comprehensive written estimate of the costs of regular agency 
36employees providing the subject services in the most cost-efficient manner. The estimate 
37must include all direct and indirect costs of regular agency employees providing the 
38subject services, including, but not limited to, pension, insurance and other employee 
39benefit costs. For the purpose of reducing this estimate, an employee organization 
40representing employees of the agency may at any time before the final day for the agency 
41to receive sealed bids pursuant to subsection 2 propose an amendment to any relevant 
42collective bargaining agreement to which the employee organization is a party, but such 
43an amendment may take effect only if the effect of the amendment is to reduce the 
44estimate below the contract cost pursuant to subsection 7. An estimate under this 
45subsection remains confidential until after the final day for the agency to receive sealed 
Page 4 - 129LR1091(01)-11bids for the privatization contract pursuant to subsection 2, at which time the estimate 
2becomes a public record and must be filed in the agency and with the Commissioner of 
3Administrative and Financial Services and transmitted to the Attorney General for review 
4pursuant to section 483.
56.  Employee bids.  Employees of an agency seeking a privatization contract under 
6subsection 1 and who are represented by an employee organization may organize and 
7submit a bid to provide the subject services under this section.  After consulting any 
8relevant employee organizations, an agency seeking to enter into a privatization contract 
9shall provide adequate resources for the purpose of encouraging and assisting agency 
10employees to organize and submit a bid to provide the subject services. In determining 
11what resources are adequate for this purpose, the agency shall refer to an existing 
12collective bargaining agreement of a similar employee organization whose members 
13perform the subject services that provides similar resources in the same or other agencies, 
14except that, if no such collective bargaining agreement exists, the agency shall refer to 
15any existing comparable collective bargaining agreement providing similar resources and 
16shall provide such resources at the minimum level of assistance provided in the similar 
17agreement. The agency shall consider an employee bid under this subsection on the same 
18basis as all other bids received under subsection 2. An employee bid under this subsection 
19is not a public record under Title 1, chapter 13, subchapter 1 before the designation of the 
20winning bidder under subsection 7.  An employee bid under this subsection may be made 
21as a joint venture with other persons.
227.  Designation of winning bidder.  After soliciting and receiving all bids under 
23subsection 2, an agency publicly shall designate the bidder to which it proposes to award 
24the privatization contract. The agency shall prepare a comprehensive written analysis of 
25the contract cost based upon the designated bid, specifically including the costs of 
26transition from public to private operation, of any additional unemployment and 
27retirement benefits and of monitoring and otherwise administering contract performance. 
28If the designated bidder proposes to perform any or all of the contract outside the 
29boundaries of the State, the contract cost must be increased by the amount of any lost 
30income tax revenue to the State by the corresponding elimination of agency employees, 
31as determined by the State Tax Assessor.
328.  Certification to Attorney General.  For a privatization contract of a designated 
33bidder under subsection 7, the head of the agency and the Commissioner of 
34Administrative and Financial Services shall each certify in writing to the Attorney 
35General that:
36A.  The contract complies with all provisions of this section and of all other 
37applicable laws;
38B.  The quality of the services to be provided by the designated bidder is likely to 
39satisfy the quality requirements of the statement prepared pursuant to subsection 2 
40and to equal or exceed the quality of services that could be provided by regular 
41agency employees pursuant to subsection 5;
42C.  The contract cost pursuant to subsection 7 will be less than the estimated cost 
43pursuant to subsection 5;
Page 5 - 129LR1091(01)-11D.  The designated bidder and its supervisory employees while in the employ of the 
2designated bidder have no adjudicated record of substantial or repeated willful 
3noncompliance with any relevant federal or state regulatory statute, including, but not 
4limited to, statutes concerning labor relations, occupational safety and health, 
5nondiscrimination and affirmative action, environmental protection and conflicts of 
6interest; and
7E.  The proposed privatization contract is in the public interest and meets all 
8applicable quality and fiscal standards.
9A copy of the proposed privatization contract must accompany the certification 
10transmitted to the Attorney General under this subsection.
119.  Rules.  The Department of Administrative and Financial Services may adopt rules 
12to carry out the provisions of this chapter and to ensure that the competitive bidding 
13process under this section is consistent with the provisions of competitive bids under 
14section 1825-B.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as 
15defined in chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
16§483.  Review by Attorney General
171.  Review by Attorney General.  A privatization contract submitted to the Attorney 
18General becomes valid 30 business days after receipt of the certification for the contract 
19required by section 482, subsection 8 unless the Attorney General notifies the agency of 
20an objection to the contract within 30 business days of receipt of the certification. An 
21objection by the Attorney General under this subsection must be in writing and state 
22specifically the Attorney General's finding that the agency has failed to comply with one 
23or more of the requirements of section 482, including that, based on independent review 
24of all the relevant facts, the Attorney General finds incorrect any of the information in the 
25certification required by section 482, subsection 8. The Attorney General may extend the 
26time for objections for an additional period of 30 business days beyond the original 30 
27business days by written notice to the agency stating the reason for the extension.
282.  Summonses by Attorney General.  For the purpose of reviewing an agency's 
29compliance and certification pursuant to section 482, the Attorney General or the 
30Attorney General's designee may require by summons the attendance and testimony 
31under oath of witnesses and the production of books, papers and other records relating to 
32the review. All provisions of law relative to summonses in Title 14, chapter 203 apply to 
33a summons under this subsection.
343.  Forms; rules.  The Attorney General may prescribe forms and adopt rules to carry 
35out the provisions of this chapter.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine

374.  Finality of Attorney General objection.  An objection of the Attorney General 
38pursuant to subsection 1 is final and binding, unless the Attorney General in writing 
39withdraws the objection.  If the Attorney General objects to a contract under subsection 1, 
40the privatization process under section 482 is terminated unless the agency submits a 
41revised certified contract to the Attorney General within 30 days of the date of the 
Page 6 - 129LR1091(01)-11objection. The Attorney General shall review a revised certified contract in the same 
2manner as a certified contract under subsection 1.
3SUMMARY
4This bill creates a process by which a state agency can enter a privatization contract 
5with a nongovernmental entity to perform basic agency services for up to 5 years if a 
6number of criteria are met, including:
71.  Wages and benefits for employees of the contractor are comparable to state 
8employees performing the same services;
92.  The contractor endeavors to hire agency employees terminated due to the 
10privatization;
113.  The agency provides an estimate of its costs in providing the subject services in 
12the most efficient manner;
134.  The agency provides support and resources to allow agency employees to submit a 
14competing bid to provide the privatized services;
155.  The agency considers as a contract cost any income tax revenue lost to the State as 
16a result of services to be performed out of state under the contract; and
176.  The Attorney General performs a review to determine that all of the requirements 
18of the bidding process and privatization contract have been met.
