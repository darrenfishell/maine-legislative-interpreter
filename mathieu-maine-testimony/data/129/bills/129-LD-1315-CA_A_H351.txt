CutTent biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish an enhanced crisis stabilization 
reimbursement rate under the MaineCare program that is sufficient to provide medically monitored crisis support and 
intervention provided to persons 18 years of age or older with inental health and co-occurring substance use disorders 
who voluntarily seek treatment. The department will need to update rules which will include a rate review to identify 
the rate or rates for this service, who will qualify for the services and which providers will be eligible to provide the 
service. As the rate for the service and how many individuals would voluntarily seek treatment are not known, no 
estimate of the cost of this change is made at this time.
