33records.  The bill also provides that such records are open to inspection by anyone.  The 
34bill provides that reports concerning the transfer of property held by the Department of 
35Public Safety and then ordered by a court to be forfeited to another governmental entity 
36must be provided upon request to the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial 
37Services and the Office of Fiscal and Program Review.  The Department of Public 
38Safety's reports must account for any such forfeiture that occurred during the 12 months

2Administrative and Financial Services and the Office of Fiscal and Program Review and 
3the current law that requires the Department of Public Safety to maintain a centralized
