This amendment eliminates the ongoing General Fund appropriations in the bill of $500,000 per year beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20 to the School Finance and Operations program within the Department of Education to provide 
funding to those school administrative units that start or expand alternative breakfast delivery services that provide 
breakfast after the start of the school day. Instead, this amendment provides "one-time" General Fund appropriations 
of $500,000 per year in both fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 only to a newly created Alternative Breakfast Delivery 
Service program within the department to be used for the same purpose. The funds do not lapse, but must be carried 
forward into the next fiscal year.
