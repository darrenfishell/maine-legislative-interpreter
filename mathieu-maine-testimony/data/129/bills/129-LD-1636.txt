5§10451.  Citation forms; enforcement
61.  Forms.   The commissioner shall designate the Uniform Summons and Complaint 
7as the citation form to be used by the warden service for criminal violations defined in 
8this Part and shall designate the Violation Summons and Complaint as the citation form 
9to be used by the warden service for civil violations defined in this Part.
102.  Responsibility for issuance and disposition.  The commissioner is responsible 
11for all fish and wildlife citation forms approved by the Chief Judge of the District Court 
12prior to May 1, 1991.  The Department of Public Safety is responsible for all Uniform 
13Summons and Complaints Complaint forms issued to the warden service.  The 
14commissioner or the commissioner's designee is responsible for the further issuance of 
15Uniform Summons and Complaint books to individual wardens law enforcement officers 
16and for the proper disposition of those books.
173.  Lawful complaint.  If the citation provided for in this section or a Uniform 
18Summons and Complaint is duly sworn to as required by law and otherwise legally 
19sufficient in respect to the form of a complaint and charging an offense, it may be filed in 
20a court having jurisdiction and constitutes a lawful complaint for the purpose of the 
21commencement of any criminal prosecution or civil violation proceeding.
224.  Lawful summons.  A citation as provided for in this section or a Uniform 
23Summons and Complaint, when served upon a person by a law enforcement officer, acts 
24as a summons to appear in court or to otherwise respond in accordance with law on or 
25before the date specified in the summons.
26A.  Any person who fails to appear in court as directed by the summons or to 
27otherwise respond in accordance with law on or before the date specified in the 
28summons commits a Class E crime.
29B.  Upon a person's failure to appear or respond in accordance with law, the court 
30may issue a warrant of arrest.  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this 
31subsection that the failure to appear or respond resulted from just cause.
325.  Enforcement of civil violations.  Civil violations must be enforced as provided in 
33this subsection.
34A.  A law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that a civil violation 
35has been committed by a person shall issue or have delivered a written summons to 
36that person.
37B.  A law enforcement agency in this State shall use the Violation Summons and 
38Complaint for civil violations defined in this Part.  The Violation Summons and 
39Complaint form must be uniform throughout the State, must be issued in books with 
Page 2 - 129LR1954(01)-11summonses in no less than quadruplicate.  The form must include, at a minimum, the 
2signature of the law enforcement officer, a brief description of the alleged offense 
3and the date on or before which the person is to file a written answer with the 
4violations bureau established under Title 4, section 164, subsection 12.  The Violation 
5Summons and Complaint must also include statements that indicate that signing the 
6summons does not constitute an admission of guilt or plea of guilty and that refusal to 
7sign after having been ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer is a separate 
8Class E crime.  The form of the Violation Summons and Complaint must be approved 
9by the Chief Judge of the District Court prior to its use.
10C.  A person to whom a law enforcement officer is authorized to issue or deliver a 
11summons pursuant to paragraph A who intentionally fails or refuses to provide the 
12officer reasonably credible evidence of the person's correct name, address and date of 
13birth commits a Class E crime if the person persists in that failure or refusal after 
14having been informed by the officer of the provisions of this paragraph. If the person 
15furnishes the officer evidence of that person's correct name, address and date of birth 
16and the evidence does not appear to be reasonably credible, the officer shall attempt 
17to verify the evidence as quickly as is reasonably possible. During the period that 
18verification is being attempted, the officer may require the person to remain in the 
19officer's presence for a period not to exceed 2 hours. During this period, if the officer 
20reasonably believes that the officer's safety or the safety of others present requires, 
21the officer may search for any dangerous weapon by an external patting of the 
22person's outer clothing. If in the course of the search the officer feels an object that 
23the officer reasonably believes to be a dangerous weapon, the officer may take such 
24action as is necessary to examine the object but may take permanent possession of the 
25object only if it is subject to forfeiture under this Part or other provisions of state or 
26federal law. The requirement that the person remain in the presence of the officer 
27does not constitute an arrest.
28After informing the person of the provisions of this paragraph, the officer may arrest 
29the person either if the person intentionally refuses to furnish evidence of that 
30person's correct name, address and date of birth or if, after attempting to verify the 
31evidence as provided for in this paragraph, the officer has probable cause to believe 
32that the person has intentionally failed to provide reasonably credible evidence of the 
33person's correct name, address and date of birth.
34D.  If, at any time subsequent to an arrest made pursuant to paragraph C, it appears 
35that the evidence of the person's correct name, address and date of birth was accurate, 
36the person must be released from custody and any record of that custody must show 
37that the person was released for that reason. If, upon trial for violating paragraph C, a 
38person is acquitted on the ground that the evidence of the person's correct name, 
39address and date of birth was accurate, the record of acquittal must show that that was 
40the ground.
41E.  A Violation Summons and Complaint, when issued or delivered to a person by a 
42law enforcement officer pursuant to paragraph A or served on the person in the 
43manner prescribed by rule of the Supreme Judicial Court, acts as an order to file a
