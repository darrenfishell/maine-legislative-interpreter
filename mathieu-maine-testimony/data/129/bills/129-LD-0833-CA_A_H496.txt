Allowing emergency communications specialists (including employees in a lead or supervisory position) employed 
within the Department of Public Safety on or after July 1, 2020 to participate in the 1998 Special Plan of the Maine 
' Public Employees Retirement System will increase both the normal cost and unfunded actuarial liability components 
of the employer retirement rate, resulting in increased employer contributions to the Maine Public Employees 
Retirement System for these positions beginning in fiscal year 2020-21. 
This legislation includes a transition provision for those emergency communication specialists hired by the 
department prior to July 1, 2020 which allows these employees to elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan no 
later than September 30, 2020. Based on an analysis performed by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, 
this fiscal note assumes that 42 emergency communication specialists (including those employees in a lead or a 
supervisory position) will elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan as soon as the option becomes available and 
the remaining specialists will opt to stay in the State Regular Plan. This bill includes a Consolidated Emergency 
Communications Fund allocation of $91,838 in fiscal year 2020-21 to the Department of Public Safety for the cost 
associated with moving the positions to the 1998 Special Plan. 
If any of the emergency communications specialists hired by the Depatiment of Public Safety prior to July 1, 2020 
who choose to remain in the State Regular Plan eventually retire or otherwise vacate their positions, any newly hired 
emergency communication specialists will be placed in the 1998 Special Plan. The additional cost to the Bureau of 
Motor Vehicles to fill these positions at the higher employer contribution rate is estimated to be between $2,000 and 
$3,000 per position annually. When this additional cost will be incurred cannot be determined at this time.
