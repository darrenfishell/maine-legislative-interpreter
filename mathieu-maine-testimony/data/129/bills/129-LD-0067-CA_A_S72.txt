Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill amends the Maine Criminal Code to extend from 8 to 20 years the statute of limitations applicable to certain 
Class A, B and C crimes. While there could be an increase in the number of cases filed and individuals incarcerated, 
the changes to the statute of limitations apply only to instances committed on or after the effective date of the bill or 
for cases where the statute of limitations has not yet expired under current law. As such, any increased costs to the 
Judicial Branch, the Department of Corrections, and Indigent Legal Services would occur in a future biennium.
