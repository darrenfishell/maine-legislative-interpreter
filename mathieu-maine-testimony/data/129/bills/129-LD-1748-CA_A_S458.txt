COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 582, L.D. 1748
Page 5 - 129LR1608(02)-1
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT12.  Notice; filing.  A notice of a commercial PACE agreement must be filed in the 
2appropriate registry of deeds. The filing of this notice creates a commercial PACE lien 
3against the property subject to the commercial PACE assessment until the amounts due 
4under the terms of the commercial PACE agreement are paid in full. A notice filed under 
5this subsection must, at a minimum, include:
6A.  The amount of funds disbursed or to be disbursed pursuant to the commercial 
7PACE agreement;
8B.  The names and addresses of the current owners of the qualifying property subject 
9to the commercial PACE assessment;
10C.  A description of the qualifying property subject to the commercial PACE 
11assessment, including its tax map and lot number;
12D.  The duration of the commercial PACE agreement;
13E.  The name and address of the entity filing the notice; and
14F.  Written verification of mortgage lender consent, if there is a mortgage on the 
15property.
163.  Priority.  A commercial PACE lien secures payment for any unpaid commercial 
17PACE assessment and, together with all associated interest and penalties for default and 
18associated attorney's fees and collection costs, takes precedence over all other liens or 
19encumbrances except a lien for real property taxes of the municipality and liens of 
20municipal sewer and water districts. From the date of recording, a commercial PACE lien 
21is a priority lien against a property, subject only to liens set out in section 6111-A, Title 
2236, section 552 and Title 38, sections 1050 and 1208, except that the priority of such a 
23commercial PACE lien over any lien, except for a lien held by a sewer, water or other 
24municipal district, that existed prior to the commercial PACE lien is subject to the written 
25consent of such existing lienholder.
264.  Mortgage lender notice and consent.  Any financial institution holding a lien, 
27mortgage or security interest in or other collateral encumbrance on the property for which 
28a commercial PACE assessment is sought must be provided written notice of the 
29commercial property owner's intention to participate in the commercial PACE program 
30and acknowledge in writing to the commercial property owner and municipality that the 
31financial institution has received such notice.  A commercial PACE assessment may not 
32be approved until the financial institution holding the lien, mortgage or security interest in 
33or other collateral encumbrance on the property has provided written consent to the 
34commercial property owner and municipality that the borrower may participate and enroll 
35the collateral property in the commercial PACE program.  This written consent must be 
36filed in the registry of deeds.
375.  Collection, default and foreclosure.  A commercial PACE assessment for which 
38notice is properly recorded under this section creates a lien on the property. The portion 
39of the assessment that has not yet become due is not eliminated by foreclosure, and the 
40lien may not be accelerated or extinguished until fully repaid.
41A lien created by a commercial PACE assessment recorded in the registry of deeds and 
42any interest, fees, penalties and attorney's fees incurred in its collection must be collected 
43in the same manner as the real property taxes of the municipality in which the property is 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 582, L.D. 1748
Page 6 - 129LR1608(02)-1
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1located. If a commercial PACE assessment is delinquent or in default, collection may 
2occur only by the recording of liens and by foreclosure under Title 36, sections 942 and 
3943. Liens must be recorded and released in the same manner as liens for real property 
4taxes.
56.  Judicial sale or foreclosure by 3rd-party lienholder.  In the event of a judicial 
6or nonjudicial sale or foreclosure by a 3rd-party lienholder of a property subject to a 
7commercial PACE lien, the lien must survive the foreclosure or sale to the extent of any 
8unpaid installment, interest, penalties or fees secured by the lien that were not paid from 
9the proceeds of the sale.  All parties with mortgages or liens on that property, including 
10without limitation commercial PACE lien holders, must receive on account of such 
11mortgages or liens sale proceeds in accordance with the priority established in this 
12chapter and by applicable law.  A commercial PACE assessment is not eliminated by 
13foreclosure and cannot be accelerated.  Only the portion of a commercial PACE 
14assessment that is in arrears at the time of foreclosure takes precedence over other 
15mortgages or liens; the remainder transfers with the property at resale.
16Unless otherwise agreed upon by the lender, all payments on a commercial PACE 
17assessment that become due after the date of transfer by judicial or nonjudicial sale or 
18foreclosure must continue to be secured by a lien on the property and are the 
19responsibility of the transferee.
207.  Release of lien.  A municipality shall discharge a commercial PACE lien created 
21under subsection 2 upon full payment of the amount specified in the commercial PACE 
22agreement. A discharge under this subsection must be filed with the appropriate registry 
23of deeds and must include reference to the notice required under subsection 2.' 
24Amend the bill in section 1 in §10206 in subsection 1 in the 4th line (page 6, line 5 in 
25L.D.) by striking out the following: "vendor certification" and inserting the following: 
26'any applicable vendor certification required'
27Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
28section number to read consecutively.

assurance system and develop and provide model commerc ial PACE ordinances, forms and other implementation 
materials to interested parties. EMT is authorized to collect fees to cover its costs of administering the program. The 
creation and administration of the comme rical PACE program will result in additional expenditures by EMT. These 
expenditures will be offset by fees collected.  No estimat e of these costs and revenues is made at this time.   129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
