6the following terms have the following meanings.
7A.  "Employer" means any private or public employer, including the State and 
8political subdivisions of the State.

17emergency medical services provider has been dispatched.
182.  Prohibition against discharge or disciplinary action.  An employer may not 
19discharge or take any other disciplinary action against or otherwise discriminate against 
20an employee because of the employee's failure to report for work at the beginning of the 
21employee's regular working hours or the employee's absence during the employee's 
22regular working hours if the employee failed to do so or was absent because the employee 
23was responding to an emergency in the employee's capacity as a firefighter or emergency 
24medical services person and the employee reported for work as soon as reasonably 
25possible after being released from the emergency.  An employer may charge the lost time 
26against the employee's regular pay or against the employee's available leave time.  This 
27subsection does not apply to the absence of a firefighter or emergency medical services 
28person from the firefighter's that person's regular employment as a law enforcement 
29officer, a utility worker or medical personnel when the services of that person are 
30essential to protect public health or safety or if the employee has been designated as 
31essential by the employer pursuant to subsection 6.
323.  Notification; verification.  If time permits, when an employee is responding as a 
33firefighter to an emergency, the An employee responding to an emergency under 
34subsection 2 shall make every effort to immediately notify the employer that the 
35employee may be late arriving to work or absent from work as a result of responding to 
36an emergency prior to or during the employee's regular working hours.  Notification may 
37be provided by the employee, the employee's designee or the fire department supervisor 
38shall notify the employer that the employee will not report to work at the appointed time

2time of release from the call verifying that the employee was responding to an emergency 
3and specifying the date, time and duration of the response.
44.  Enforcement; penalty for violation.  If an employer has violated subsection 2, 
5the employee may bring an action in Superior Court in the county in which the employee 
6resides or in the county in which the employer's place of business is located.  The action 
7must be brought within one year of the date of the alleged violation.  If the court finds 
8that the employer violated subsection 2, and if the employee so requests, the court shall 
9order the employer to reinstate the employee in the employee's former position without 
10reduction of pay, seniority or other benefits. The court also shall order any other 
11appropriate remedy necessary to return the employee to the position the employee would 
12have been in had the employer not violated subsection 2, including payment of back pay 
13and reinstatement of any other benefits lost during the period in which the discharge or 
14disciplinary action was in effect.

16and the employee have entered into a written agreement, signed by the employer and the 
17employee, that governs procedures to be followed when the employee is called to respond 
18to an emergency as a firefighter or emergency medical services person.  This subsection 
19applies only if:
20A.  The local official in charge of calling out firefighters has a written policy that:
21(1)  Specifies the circumstances under which firefighters will be ordered to 
22remain at an emergency; and
23(2)  Affirms that firefighters will be released as soon as practicable; and
24B.  The employee presents a copy of the policy to the employer upon notifying the 
25employer of the employee's status as a firefighter.
266.  Designation as essential.  Upon receiving notice of an employee's firefighter 
27status, an employer may designate the employee essential to the employer's operations 
28when the absence of the employee would cause disruption of the employer's business.
297.  Information to be filed by employee with employer.  This section applies only 
30if:
31A.  The chief of the fire department or emergency medical services provider has a 
32written policy that:

34services persons are needed to respond to an emergency; and

2firefighter or emergency medical services person, including the termination of that status, 
3within 30 days of the change.
4Sec. 2.  Maine Revised Statutes headnote amended; revision clause.  In the 
5Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, chapter 7, subchapter 4-C, in the subchapter headnote, 
6the words "firefighter; absence from work" are amended to read "firefighter or emergency 
7medical services person; absence from work" and the Revisor of Statutes shall implement 
8this revision when updating, publishing or republishing the statutes.
9SUMMARY
10Current law protects a firefighter from disciplinary action by an employer when the 
11firefighter is absent from work at the beginning of the work day because the firefighter is 
12responding to an emergency.  This bill extends the protection to a firefighter who leaves 
13work during regular working hours to respond to an emergency and provides the same 
14protections to an emergency medical services person.  The bill revises provisions 
15regarding employer notification regarding absences and employee status as a firefighter 
16or emergency medical services person and removes an employer's ability to designate an 
17employee as essential.
