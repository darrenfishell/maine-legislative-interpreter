40 and not a public record pursuant to Title 1, section 402, subsection 3.

3 processing only if the consumer provides consent to the processing or if the processing is 
4 covered by an exemption or limitation under section 175. Processing of personal data for 
5 a business purpose is presumed to be permissible unless it involves the processing of 
6 sensitive data and the risk of processing cannot be reduced through the use of appropriate 
7 administrative and technical safeguards. To the extent the controller seeks consumer 
8 consent for processing, the consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give. 
9 §174. Response to verified requests 
10 A controller that receives a verified request from a consumer through a designated 
11 request address under this chapter shall provide a response to the consumer within 60 
12 days of the controller's authentication of the request. Upon an authenticated verified
