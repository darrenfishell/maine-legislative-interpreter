SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment establishes requirements for an 
investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to establish emergency response 
plans for recovery and restoration in response to an event where widespread outages have 
occurred due to weather events or other causes beyond the utility's control. It requires 
that the prioritization process under the plan follow the statewide comprehensive 
emergency management plan and include consideration of steps to ensure safety of 
electric facilities, road opening and service restoration. The amendment requires the plan 
to detail a coordinated approach that includes: priorities for emergency response and 
service restoration, staffing, communication and coordination with emergency 
management agencies, customer communications, resource deployment and safety. 
The amendment requires each investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to 
file the plan with the Public Utilities Commission on a biannual basis and to provide a 
copy of the plan to the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, 
Maine Emergency Management Agency. The amendment allows the commission to 
designate portions of the emergency response plan as confidential through the issuance of 
a protective order. 
The amendment also authorizes the commission to open an investigation to review 
the emergency response performance of an investor-owned h·ansmission and distribution 
utility after an emergency event. If the commission, through investigation, finds that the 
utility failed to implement its emergency response plan in a prudent manner, the 
commission is required to take action to remedy the failure, which may include denying 
the recovery through rates of the costs of emergency response and service restoration. 
Finally, the amendment requires the commission to include in its annual report to the 
Legislature information regarding its activities and the performance of investor-owned 
transmission and distribution utilities in relation to emergency response plans.
