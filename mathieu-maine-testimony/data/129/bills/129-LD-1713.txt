4§1518-A.  Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents
51.  Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents.  There is created the Property 
6Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents, referred to in this section as "the fund," which must 
7be used to provide property tax relief to residents of the State.  The fund consists of all 
8resources transferred to the fund under subsection 4 and section 1536 and other resources 
9made available to the fund.  The fund must be used to reduce the individual income tax 
10rates to 4% pursuant to subsection 1-A provide relief payments to property tax payers 
11pursuant to subsection 1-B.
121-A.  Implementation.  By September 1, 2016 and annually thereafter, the State 
13Controller shall inform the State Tax Assessor of the amount available in the fund for the 
14purposes of subsection 1.
15A.  By November 1st annually, the State Tax Assessor shall calculate the amount by 
16which the income tax rates under Title 36, section 5111, subsections 1-F, 2-F and 3-F 
17may be reduced during the subsequent tax year using the amount available from the 
18fund. Bracket rate reductions must be a minimum of 0.2 percentage points in the first 
19year in which reductions are made and a minimum of 0.1 percentage points in 
20subsequent years. If sufficient funds are not available to pay for the minimum 
21reduction, a rate reduction may not be made until the amount in the fund is sufficient 
22to pay for the reduction. When the amount is sufficient to pay for the reduction, the 
23reduction must first be applied equally to each bracket under Title 36, section 5111, 
24subsections 1-F, 2-F and 3-F until the lower bracket reaches 4%. Funds available 
25from the fund in subsequent years must be applied to reduce the higher bracket rates 
26until there is a single bracket with a rate of 4%, after which future tax relief may be 
27identified.
28B.  The State Tax Assessor shall provide public notice of new bracket rates calculated 
29under this subsection by November 15th annually.

12SUMMARY
13The Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents, which is funded by the transfer of 20% of 
14the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund after all required deductions of 
15appropriations, budgeted financial commitments and adjustments considered necessary 
16by the State Controller have been made, was established to provide income tax relief by 
17reducing income tax rates once a certain level of funds in the fund is reached; to date, the 
18required level of funding to provide income tax relief has not been reached.
19This bill renames the fund the Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents and 
20requires it to be used to provide property tax relief payments directly to residents of this 
21State whose residence qualifies for an exemption under the Maine homestead property tax 
22exemption.  The amount of the tax relief payment is determined annually by dividing the 
23total amount of funds available in the Property Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents by 
24the total number of homesteads that qualify for the Maine homestead property tax 
25exemption.  If that amount is at least $100, the Treasurer of State is required, by 
26December 1st, to mail checks for the tax relief payment to each owner of a qualifying 
27homestead.
