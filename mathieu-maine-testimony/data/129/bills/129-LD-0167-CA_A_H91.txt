Potential State Mandate -Unfunded 
Requires public schools that provide meals to students under the National School 
Lunch Program or under a program administered by the United States Department of 
Agriculture to provide such a meal to a student who requests the meal regardless of 
the student's inability to pay or failure to pay for school meals in the past. Unit Affected

Significant 
statewide 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state ipandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Depa1iment of Education to develop the required guidance for school administrative districts 
related to the collection of student meal debt can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
