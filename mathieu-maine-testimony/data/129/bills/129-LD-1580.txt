16SUMMARY
17This bill allows applicants and licensees of the State Board of Nursing, the Board of 
18Osteopathic Licensure and the Board of Licensure in Medicine to review their own 
19redacted licensing files before the respective board makes the file available for inspection 
20or copying after the licensing file has been requested.
21The board must notify the applicant or licensee of the request to view the file at the 
22same time the board acknowledges the request under the Freedom of Access Act.  The 
23board must use the most recent address on file for that applicant or licensee.  If the 
24applicant or licensee would like to review the redacted file before it is made publicly 
25available, the applicant or licensee must notify the board within 10 business days.  If 
26requested by the applicant or licensee, the board must send a copy of the redacted file to 
27the applicant or licensee, and the applicant or licensee has 10 business days from when 
28the file is sent to stop the release of all or a part of the redacted licensing file by 
29petitioning the board to withhold release of all or a part of the file because making all or 
30part of the redacted file available to the public creates a potential risk to the personal 
31safety of the applicant or licensee or any 3rd party.
