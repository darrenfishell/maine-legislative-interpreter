13repairs, supplies and activities relating to its business or trade.  The fact that a vessel 
14carries on one or more of these activities at more than one location within this State or at 
15a location or locations outside this State does not prevent the vessel from being 
16considered to have an established base of operations within the State if a substantial 
17portion of these activities are carried on at a location or locations within this State.  For 
18purposes of this subsection, "substantial portion" means a period exceeding 60 30 days in
