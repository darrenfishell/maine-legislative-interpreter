5next established payday.  Any overcompensation may be withheld if authorized under

7good faith effort to provide notice of the need for the earned paid sick leave to the

9reasonable effort to schedule the use of earned paid sick leave in a manner that does 
10not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.
11C.  An employer that requires notice of the need to use earned paid sick leave when 
12the need is not foreseeable shall provide a written policy that contains procedures for 
13the employee to provide notice. An employer that has not provided to an employee a 
14copy of its written policy for providing notice under this paragraph may not deny 
15earned paid sick leave to the employee based on noncompliance with the policy.
165.  Combined paid leave.  An employer may meet the requirements of this section 
17by providing paid leave that may be used by the employee interchangeably as either sick 
18leave or vacation time, as long as this paid leave is in accordance with the accrual of 
19earned paid sick leave in subsection 2.
206.  Supporting documentation.  For use of accrued earned paid sick leave for more 
21than 3 consecutive days, an employer may require reasonable documentation from the 
22employee in order to verify that the accrued earned paid sick leave has been used for a

24A.  Upon the employer's request, the employee must provide the documentation to the 
25employer in a timely manner. The employer may not delay the employee's use of 
26accrued earned paid sick leave on the basis that the employer has not yet received 
27documentation.
28B.  For use of accrued earned paid sick leave pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph A 
29or B, reasonable documentation for purposes of this subsection includes, but is not 
30limited to, a signed written statement from the employee or documentation signed by 
31a health care professional indicating that the employee's or family member's use of 
32accrued earned paid sick leave was based on one or more of the circumstances

2in legal action related to domestic violence or sexual assault; or
3(4)  A signed written statement from the employee.
4An employer may not require that the documentation explain the details of the 
5violence or assault.
6D.  If an employer chooses to require documentation from the employee in order to 
7verify that the accrued earned paid sick leave has been used for a permissible 
8purpose, and the employer does not offer health insurance, the employer is 
9responsible for paying all out-of-pocket expenses the employee incurs in obtaining 
10the documentation. If the employer does offer health insurance, the employer is 
11responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee by the health care 
12professional for providing the specific documentation required by the employer.
13E.  An employer may not require disclosure of details relating to domestic violence or 
14sexual assault or the details of an employee's or a family member's medical condition 
15as a condition of providing earned paid sick leave under this section.  If an employer 
16possesses health information or information pertaining to domestic violence or sexual 
17assault about an employee or a family member, the employer shall treat that 
18information as confidential and may not disclose that information except to the 
19affected employee or as approved by the affected employee.
207.  Notice of policies; posting.  The following provisions govern notice and posting 
21requirements.

24(1)  Employees are entitled to earned paid sick leave;
25(2)  The accrual and amount of earned paid sick leave provided under this 
26section;
27(3)  The terms of use for earned paid sick leave guaranteed under this section;
28(4)  That retaliatory personnel action against employees who request or use 
29earned paid sick leave is prohibited by law;
30(5)  That each employee has the right to file a complaint or bring a civil action if 
31earned paid sick leave as required by this section is denied by the employer or the 
32employee is subjected to retaliatory personnel action for requesting or taking 
33earned paid sick leave; and
34(6)  The contact information for the department from which questions about 
35rights and responsibilities under this section can be answered.
36This notice must be in English and any language that is the first language spoken by 
37at least 10% of the employer's workforce, as long as the notice has been provided by 
38the department pursuant to paragraph D.
39B.  An employer shall record on the employee's regular pay stub, or an attachment to 
40the pay stub, an accounting of the amount of earned paid sick leave available to the 
Page 5 - 129LR0150(01)-11employee, the amount of earned paid sick leave taken by the employee to date in the 
2year and the amount of pay the employee has received as earned paid sick leave.
3C.  An employer shall display a poster that contains the information required in 
4paragraph A in a conspicuous and accessible place in each establishment where 
5employees are employed.  The poster displayed must be in English and any language 
6that is the first language spoken by at least 10% of the employer's workforce, as long 
7as the poster has been provided by the department pursuant to paragraph D.

9spoken by at least 10% of the State's workforce and any other language determined to 
10be appropriate by the department, model notices and posters that contain the 
11information required for employers' use in complying with paragraphs A and C.
128.  Record keeping.  An employer shall retain records for a period of 3 years 
13documenting hours worked by employees and earned paid sick leave taken by employees, 
14and shall allow the department access to such records, with appropriate notice and at a 
15mutually agreeable time, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this section.  
16When a dispute arises as to an employee's entitlement to earned paid sick leave under this 
17section, if the employer has not maintained adequate records documenting hours worked 
18by the employee and earned paid sick leave taken by the employee, or does not allow the 
19department reasonable access to such records, there is a presumption that the employer 
20has violated this section, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

22to use earned paid sick leave pursuant to this section, the right to file a complaint or 
23inform any person about any employer's alleged violation of this section, the right to 
24cooperate with the department in its investigations of alleged violations of this section 
25and the right to inform any person of that person's rights under this section.  An employer 
26or any other person may not interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of, or the attempt 
27to exercise, any of these rights.
28An employer may not take retaliatory personnel action or otherwise discriminate against 
29an employee because the employee has exercised a right protected under this section.  An 
30employer's absence control policy may not treat earned paid sick leave taken under this 
31section as an absence that may lead to or result in retaliatory personnel action.  The 
32protections in this section apply to any person who mistakenly, but in good faith, alleges 
33a violation of this section.
3410.  Violation; rebuttable presumption.  There is a rebuttable presumption of a 
35violation of this section if an employer takes adverse personnel action against an 
36employee within 90 days after that employee does any of the following:

211.  Complaints and investigation.  The department shall enforce the provisions of 
3this section.  The department shall establish a system that allows for multiple methods of 
4communication by which it may receive complaints regarding any alleged violations of 
5this section.  Any person alleging a violation of this section may file a complaint with the 
6department.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, the name and other identifying 
7information of the person reporting the alleged violation is confidential and may not be 
8disclosed except that, with the authorization of the person reporting the alleged violation, 
9the department may disclose the person's name and other identifying information as 
10determined to be necessary to enforce this section or for other appropriate purposes.  
11Filing a complaint with the department is neither a prerequisite nor a bar to bringing a 
12civil action.
13Upon receiving a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter, the department shall 
14investigate the complaint in a timely manner and shall attempt to resolve the complaint 
15through mediation between the complainant and the subject of the complaint or through 
16other means. The department shall keep a complainant notified regarding the status of the 
17complaint and any resultant investigation.  If the department determines that a violation 
18of this section has occurred, it shall issue to the person or entity it has determined has 
19violated this section a notice of violation describing the relief required of the person or 
20entity.  The department shall prescribe the form and wording of such notices of violation 
21and any method of appealing the decision of the department.
2212.  Civil violation.  An employer that fails to provide earned paid sick leave in 
23violation of this section or who takes retaliatory personnel action against an employee or 
24former employee commits a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $1,000 may 
25be adjudged.
26An employer that willfully violates the notice or posting requirements in subsection 7 
27commits a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $100 may adjudged.
2813.  Private right of action.  An employer that violates this section is liable to the 
29individual affected by the violation for appropriate relief collectible in a civil action, 
30including, but not limited, to the following relief:
31A.  Payment for unpaid leave taken that should have been earned paid sick leave;
32B.  Payment of back wages;
33C.  An amount equal to the sum of the amounts under paragraphs A, B and D, if 
34applicable, as liquidated damages;
35D.  Costs and reasonable attorney's fees, at the discretion of the court;
36E.  Rehiring or reinstatement to the individual's previous position with the employer; 
37and
38F.  Reestablishment of employee benefits to which the individual otherwise would 
39have been eligible if the individual had not been subjected to retaliatory personnel 
40action or discrimination.
Page 7 - 129LR0150(01)-11An affected individual may bring a civil action to collect appropriate relief.  An action 
2taken by an affected individual under this subsection may be brought not later than 3 
3years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action 
4is brought or the date when the individual knew of the violation, whichever is later.  The 
5right to bring an action provided by this subsection terminates on the filing of a complaint 
6by the Attorney General in an action under subsection 14 in which a recovery is sought 
7related to the same violation or violations of an employer relating to the affected 
8individual. 
914.  Civil action by the department.  The department may impose penalties and 
10may grant an employee or individual all appropriate relief, including, but not limited to, 
11payment of all earned paid sick leave improperly withheld, all damages incurred by the 
12complainant as the result of violation of this section, back pay and reinstatement in the 
13case of job loss.
14If the director determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that an employer 
15violated this section and the department is subsequently unable to obtain voluntary 
16compliance by the employer within a reasonable time, the department shall bring a civil 
17action through the Attorney General on behalf of an affected individual or individuals as 
18provided in subsection 13, except that a civil action may not be brought on behalf of an 
19individual has filed an action under subsection 13 related to the same violation or 
20violations of this section.
21A civil action brought under this subsection may be joined with a civil action to collect 
22fines under subsection 12.
2315.  Effect on collective bargaining.  Except for a collective bargaining agreement 
24as described in subsection 16, paragraph A, a contract or agreement between the 
25employer and the employee or any acceptance by the employee of a paid leave policy that 
26provides fewer rights or benefits than provided by this section is void and unenforceable.

28applies subject to the following.

30agreement during the period between January 1, 2021 and the expiration of the 
31agreement.  This section does apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining 
32agreement entered into and in effect on or after January 1, 2021, unless the collective 
33bargaining agreement expressly waives the requirements of this section in clear and 
34unambiguous terms.
35B.  This section does not apply to an individual employed by the individual's parent,

39resignation, retirement or other separation from employment for accrued earned paid 
40sick leave that has not been used.
41D.  A successor employer, or an employer over which there is substantial common 
42ownership, management or control between the successor and predecessor employer, 
Page 8 - 129LR0150(01)-11is responsible for the earned paid sick leave rights accrued by employees of the 
2predecessor employer.  These employees are entitled to use earned paid sick leave 
3previously accrued pursuant to the terms provided in this section, irrespective of the 
490-day period described in subsection 2.
5E.  If an employee separates from employment and is rehired by the same employer 
6within 12 months of the separation, the employer shall reinstate previously accrued, 
7unused earned paid sick leave and shall permit the reinstated employee to use that 
8accrued earned paid sick leave and to accrue additional earned paid sick leave upon 
9reinstatement.
1017.  Rules.  The department shall adopt rules to implement and enforce the provisions 
11of this section and section 638, including rules regarding the receipt, investigation and
