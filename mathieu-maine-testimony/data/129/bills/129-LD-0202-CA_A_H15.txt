This bill increases the number of qualifying contributions from 3,200 to 6,000 that verified registered voters must 
make to a gubernatorial candidate for that candidate to be ce1tified as a Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) 
candidate. Based on historical participation levels in the program, it is likely that fewer gubernatorial candidates will 
qualify for funding as a result of the increased threshold within the qualifying period. This reduction in gubernatorial 
candidates will reduce anticipated spending from the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) by $1,656,175 in fiscal 
year 2021-22 and $1,545,800 in fiscal year 2022-23. Because fewer gubernatorial candidates may seek funding and 
will not collect qualifying contributions, revenue to the MCEF will also decrease by $40,000 in fiscal year 2021-22 
and $48,000 in fiscal year 2022-23.
