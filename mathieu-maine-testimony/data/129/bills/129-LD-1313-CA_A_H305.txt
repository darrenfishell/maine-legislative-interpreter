26 SUMMARY 
27 This amendment is the majority report and makes the following changes to the bill. 
28 1. It creates in the Maine Criminal Code affirmative defenses to prosecution for 
29 aggravated attempted murder, for murder and for aiding or soliciting suicide. A person 
30 may raise an affirmative defense to prosecution for these crimes if that person's conduct 
31 was expressly authorized by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 418. The 
32 amendment also strikes from the bill language that creates new Class A crimes and other 
33 penalty language, as the prohibited conduct described is sufficiently covered by existing 
34 statute. 
35 2. It changes the rule-making authority of the Department of Health and Human 
36 Services for rules for the collection of information from routine technical to major 
37 substantive. 
38 3. It makes technical changes to the provisions regarding insurance in order to 
39 conform to current Maine law.
