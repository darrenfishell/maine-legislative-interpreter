5further amended to read:
61.  Lien.  The lien provided in section 552 must continue for purposes of protecting 
7the State's deferred tax interest in tax deferred property.  When it is determined that one 
8of the events set out in section 6259 has occurred and that a property is no longer eligible 
9for property tax deferral under this chapter, the State Tax Assessor shall send notice by 
10certified mail to the owner taxpayer, or the owner's taxpayer's heirs or devisees, listing 
11the total amount of deferred property taxes, including accrued interest and costs of all the 
12years and demanding payment on or before April 30th of the year following the tax year 
13in which the circumstances causing withdrawal from the provisions of this chapter occur.
14When the circumstances listed in section 6259, subsection 4 occur, the amount of 
15deferred taxes is due and payable 5 days before the date of removal of the property from 
16the State.
17If the deferred tax liability of a property has not been satisfied by the April 30th demand 
18date, the State Tax Assessor shall, within 30 days, record in the registry of deeds in the 
19county where the real estate is located a tax lien certificate signed by the State Tax 
20Assessor or bearing the assessor's facsimile signature, setting forth the total amount of 
21deferred tax liability, a description of the real estate on which the tax was deferred and an 
22allegation that a tax lien is claimed on the real estate to secure payment of the tax, that a 
23demand for payment of the tax has been made in accordance with this section and that the 
24tax remains unpaid.
25At the time of the recording of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds, the State 
26Tax Assessor shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each record holder 
27of a mortgage on the real estate, to the holder's last known address, a true copy of the tax

30lien as established by Title 33, section 751, plus $13.  Upon redemption, the State Tax 
31Assessor shall prepare and record a discharge of the tax lien mortgage.  The lien 
32described in section 552 is the basis of this tax lien mortgage procedure.
33The filing of the tax lien certificate, provided for in this section, in the registry of deeds 
34creates a mortgage on the real estate to the State and has priority over all other mortgages, 
35liens, attachments and encumbrances of any nature and gives to the State all rights 
36usually instant to a mortgage, except that the mortgagee does not have any right of 
37possession of the real estate until the right of redemption expires.
38Payments accepted during the redemption period may not interrupt or extend the 
39redemption period or in any way affect the foreclosure procedures.

4municipal tax collector concerning the amount of deferred property taxes in the respective 
5municipality, the State Tax Assessor shall certify that amount to the Treasurer of the 
6State, who shall make payment to the municipality on or before the 15th day of the 
7following month.
81-A.  Prorated payment of deferred taxes.  The State Tax Assessor is authorized to 
9prorate payments to municipalities for claims filed pursuant to this chapter if the amount 
10available in the Senior Property Tax Deferral Revolving Account established in section 
116266 in any fiscal year is insufficient to make full payments to all municipalities.  If the 
12applicant for deferred taxes can not pay the difference due to the municipality, the 
13municipality that does not receive the full amount of deferred property taxes may cause a 
14tax lien certificate to be filed in the county registry of deeds for the amount not received.
151-B.  Reimbursement to taxpayers.  The State Tax Assessor is authorized to 
16reimburse taxpayers who qualified under this chapter and who have paid property taxes 
17that would have otherwise been deferred but for the prorating of benefits as allowed in 
18subsection 1-A.
192.  Accounts maintained.  The bureau shall maintain accounts for each deferred 
20property and shall accrue interest only on the actual amount of taxes payments advanced 
21to the municipality.
22Sec. 7.  36 MRSA §6267, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 707, Pt. G, §10, is repealed.
23Sec. 8.  Application.  This Act applies to property tax years beginning on or after 
24April 1, 2020.
25SUMMARY
26This bill reinstitutes the property tax deferral program for seniors which, until April 
271, 1991, provided a mechanism allowing qualifying senior homeowners to defer property 
28tax payments and required the State to pay the property taxes on behalf of the 
29homeowners.  The bill makes the existing abatement and appeal processes available in 
30cases in which the State Tax Assessor disagrees with the municipal assessment of a 
31property eligible for enrollment in the program and makes other technical changes to the 
32program to bring it into conformity with current law.
