Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Establishes new Class C crimes; increases correctional and judicial costs. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
The Department of Corrections has not indicated a need for additional funding. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill creates a new Class C crime of retaliation against a witness, informant, victim or juror. Any future charges 
brought under this new crime are likely to coincide with criminal charges for conduct that is already a violation of 
existing law. As such, additional new cases and individuals incarcerated as a result of the establishment of this crime 
are expected to be few. Any additional costs to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to defend against 
this new charge are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
