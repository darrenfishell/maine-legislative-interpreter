)Fiscal Detail and Notes 
All of the impacts described below are contigent on at least one municipality voting to impose a local sales tax. 
This bill creates a local option sales tax of 1 % on prepared food and lodging. Municipalities can opt to create this tax 
through a municipal referendum. Revenues would be distributed 75% to participating municipalities and 25% to the 
Maine Rural Development Authority. If all municipalities were to opt for and approve this tax, annual revenues to 
municipalities and the Maine Rural Development Authority would be approximately $30 million and $10 million, 
respectively. The Department of Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) has indicated it would require a 
General Fund appropriation of $850,000 in each of the first two years for computer programming, data cleansing, 
forms design, etc. to establish a local option sales tax system. DAFS would also require $109,000 annually for one 
Revenue Agent position. 
Although it is not possible to predict how many municipalities would implement a local 1 % tax, for comparison 
purposes Maine Revenue Services has estimated that if all municipalities voted to do so, General Fund revenue could 
be reduced by an estimated $2 million annually based upon a decrease in consumption because of an increase in the 
overall sales tax rate. There is no expectation that every municipality would implement a local tax.
