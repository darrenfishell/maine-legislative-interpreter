Page 1 - 129LR2866(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, a regulatory change in certification requirements for educational 
4technicians has made some educational technicians for the first time mandatory members 
5of the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program; and
6Whereas, the affected positions had been covered by the United States Social 
7Security Act or other retirement programs; and
8Whereas, it was not the intent of the Legislature or the State Board of Education to 
9change retirement benefit coverage for the affected positions; and
10Whereas, correcting this unintended consequence immediately is necessary to 
11prevent harm to employees in these positions who would benefit from continuing to be 
12covered by the United States Social Security Act or other retirement programs; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16therefore,
17Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
18Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §17001, sub-§42, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 460, §1, is

24position for which certification is not required under Title 20-A, section 13019-H, 
25and:

Page 2 - 129LR2866(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill provides an exception to mandatory membership in the State Employee and 
3Teacher Retirement Program for employees filling certain educational technician 
4positions who do not introduce new learning plans and supervise small groups of students 
5in community-based programs and are therefore not required by statute to be certified.
