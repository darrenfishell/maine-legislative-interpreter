This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rule Chapter IO I: Maine Care Benefits 
Manual, Chapter I, Section 4, Telehealth and Chapter IO 1: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Section 13, 
Targeted Case Management Services (TCM) to provide for reimbursement of case management services delivered 
tlu·ough telehealth to targeted populations. Providers of telehealth services must submit claims for the same procedure 
codes and rates that apply to the underlying Covered Service as if those services were delivered face to face. 
Additionally, the Health Care Provider at the Originating Site may bill MaineCare for an Originating Facility Fee and 
this fee is above and beyond the normal fee for the service. This additional fee could lead to additional costs above 
what is currently paid for TCM services. However, this additional fee is utilized infrequently for current services that 
use telehealth and new telehealth services are slow to gain acceptance. Any potential new costs related to this charge 
are expected to be minimal at first with a slow increase in costs over time.
