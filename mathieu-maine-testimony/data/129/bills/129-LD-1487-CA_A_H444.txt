The bill provides free motor vehicle registrations to holders of gold star family registration plates. It would result in a 
reduction in Highway Fund revenue of $10,500 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $42,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. This 
estimate assumes increased sales of gold star family registration plates in fiscal years 2020-21 and beyond because of 
providing free motor vehicle registrations. The Depaitment of Secretary of State will require a Highway Fund 
allocation of $3,488 in fiscal year 2021-22 for materials to manufacture additional gold star family registration plates. 
$10 of each motor vehicle fee is transferred to the TransCap Trust Fund within the Maine Municipal Bond Bank. 
Therefore, the bill includes an Other Revenue Special Funds deallocation to the Maine Municipal Bond Bank of 
$3,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $12,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 to reflect lower revenue.
