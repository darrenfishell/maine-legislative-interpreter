25SUMMARY
26This bill sets forth procedures to govern the installation and monitoring of tracking 
27devices by law enforcement officers.  It amends the definition of "portable electronic 
28device" to clarify that the device is electric and defines "tracking device."  The bill also 
29establishes parallel terms and procedures in the laws governing portable electronic device 
30content information, electronic device location information and tracking information, 
31including parallel definitions of "adverse result" and "serious physical injury."  It 
32provides an exception to the requirement that notice be given to the owner or user if the 
33government entity is unable to identify the owner or user.
