10renewable deposit and a penalty or forfeiture in the payment of interest would result from 
11paying the deposit to the administrator at the time of the report, the date for payment of 
12the property to the administrator is extended until a penalty or forfeiture no longer would 
13result from payment, if the holder informs the administrator of the extended date.

34the administrator.  
358.  Nonfreely transferable security.  A holder is not required to deliver to the 
36administrator a security identified by the holder as a nonfreely transferable security.  If 
37the administrator or holder determines that a security is no longer a nonfreely transferable

2transferable security is no longer a nonfreely transferable security.
3§2114.  Effect of payment or delivery of property to administrator
41.  No liability of holder on payment or delivery.  On payment or delivery of 
5property to the administrator under this Act, the administrator as agent for the State

27the owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute or 
28court order.
293.  Income or gain.  If a holder is reimbursed by the administrator under subsection 
301, paragraph B, the holder may also recover from the administrator income or gain under

27administrator shall pay interest at the current 10-year average cash pool rate.  Interest is 
28calculated from the date the property is delivered to the administrator and ends on the 
29expiration of 10 years after its delivery or the date on which payment is made to the 
30owner, whichever is earlier.
31§2118.  Administrator's options as to custody

36B.  Taking custody of the property would be unlawful.

21of a period of limitation on an owner's right to receive or recover property, whether 
22specified by contract, statute or court order, does not prevent the property from being 
23presumed abandoned or affect the duty of a holder under this Act to file a report or pay or 
24deliver property to the administrator.
252.  Proceeding within 10 years after report; tolled.  An action or proceeding may 
26not be maintained by the administrator to enforce this Act in regard to the reporting, 
27delivery or payment of property more than 10 years after the holder specifically identified 
28the property in a report filed with the administrator or gave express notice to the 
29administrator of a dispute regarding the property.  In the absence of such a report or other 
30express notice, the period of limitation is tolled.  The period of limitation is also tolled by 
31the filing of a report that is fraudulent.
