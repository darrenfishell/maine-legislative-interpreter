SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and amends the provision regarding modification of 
an order of spousal support by specifying that an award of spousal support issued on or 
after October 1, 2013, is subject to modification when there is a substantial change in 
financial circumstances and additionally, as required in cun-ent law, it appears that justice 
requires the modification. The amendment also repeals the Maine Revised Statutes, Title
