3measured at the time of application for the certificate of approval, are employees 
4based in the State, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of completion to the 
5certified applicant as soon as is practical.  The certificate of completion must state the

11provide many other direct and indirect economic benefits to the State.

14this State.

213.  Pays at least 75% of its employees a salary that exceeds the income threshold for

234.  Agrees to make an investment of at least $35,000,000 in the construction or
