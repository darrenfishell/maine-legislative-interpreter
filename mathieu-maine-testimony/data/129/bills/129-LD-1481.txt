9the ski area and resort on the mountain for the public benefit; and
10Whereas, the State is currently engaged in litigation to enforce the performance of 
11those obligations; and
12Whereas, in order to ensure that the mountain continues to be open and operated for 
13the benefit of the public, the State may need to acquire or manage the mountain and 
14related property; and

18Whereas, a legal entity must be created as soon as possible in order to develop and 
19implement a strategy to achieve the public-interest objectives; and
20Whereas, the effective and successful implementation of such a strategy will not 
21only bring the recreational benefits of a vibrant ski resort to the Moosehead Lake region 
22but also bring significant and desired economic benefits to one of the most economically 
23challenged areas of the State; and
24Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
25the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
26immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
