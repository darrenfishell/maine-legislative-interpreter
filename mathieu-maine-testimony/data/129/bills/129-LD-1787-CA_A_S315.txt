property is damaged because that remedy is already available under the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 69. 
2. It reallocates the section of the bill regarding penalties for bag limit and 
possession limit violations for upland game to the chapter that is specific to hunting. 
3. It removes the section of the bill that prohibits a person convicted of domestic 
violence :from owning or possessing a crossbow, a muzzleloader or archery or airbow 
equipment. 
4. It reallocates the bill's provision in the law governing aggravated trafficking of 
scheduled drugs and specifies that the property on which the offense occurs is designated 
by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in rules as open to fishing for only 
persons under 16 years of age or persons holding a complimentary fishing license.
