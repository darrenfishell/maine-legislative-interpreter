Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $4,950 per year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to the 
State Board of Education for the cost of substitute teachers needed when a teacher is granted release time to serve on 
the State Board of Education. This estimate assumes that one teacher will be appointed to the board and that a 
substitute teacher will be needed for the board member teacher to attend 3 meetings per month for 10 months and an 
additional 3 clays per year for other duties, or a total of 33 days per year at a cost of $150 per clay. Absent this General 
Fund appropriation, the State Board of Education will not have sufficient funds within its existing budgeted resources 
to accommodate the cost of paying substitute teachers.
