engineering and survey practices.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment sets the 20-pound weight for paper as the minimum weight for 
recording plans at the county registries of deeds. The amendment requires that a digital 
image be at least 300 dots per inch or 300 pixels per inch, The amendment retains the 
last paragraph of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 33, section 652 in current law, which 
regards standards for the reproduction of copies. 
The fiscal note on the amendment identifies certain clerical changes in this bill as 
amended as a potential state mandate. In order to be a mandate pursuant to the 
Constitution of Maine, a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or 
modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEEAMENDMENT'A "toH.P.1007,L.D.1393 
1 committee finds that certain changes in this legislation, such as the size of the register1s 
2 block and the minimum weight of paper, do not require a registry of deeds to expand or 
3 modify its activities. The committee finds that these changes and others in this 
4 legislation, such as the minimum size of plans, do not apply to the activities of a registry 
5 of deeds but to members of the public. The committee finds that the changes to the 
6 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 33, section 652, subsection 5 that remove microfiche and 
7 microfilm as options for public copies while retaining the option of paper or digital copies 
8 do not necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. Microfiche and microfilm 
9 copies require use of separate equipment and a physical storage space. Digital copies do 
10 not require either of these and are, therefore, likely to result in savings for a registry of 
11 deeds. The committee finds that the requirement that a registry of deeds microfilm each 
12 plan for archival purposes conforms to current archival practice as established by the 
13 State Archivist and is not a new requirement.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.
