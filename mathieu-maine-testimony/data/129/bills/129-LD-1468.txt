10PART 2
11MAINE UNIFORM DIRECTED TRUST ACT
12PREFATORY NOTE
13Background. The Uniform Directed Trust Act addresses an increasingly common 
14arrangement in contemporary estate planning and asset management known as a "directed 
15trust." In a directed trust, the terms of the trust grant a person other than a trustee a power 
16over some aspect of the trust's administration. There is no consistent vocabulary to 
17describe the person other than a trustee that holds a power in a directed trust. Several 
18terms are common in practice, including "trust protector," "trust adviser," and "trust 
19director." There is much uncertainty in existing law about the fiduciary status of a 
20nontrustee that has a power over a trust and about the fiduciary duty of a trustee, 
21sometimes called an "administrative trustee" or "directed trustee," with regard to actions 
22taken or directed by the nontrustee. Existing uniform trusts and estates acts address the 
23issue inadequately. Existing nonuniform state laws are in disarray.
24Under the Uniform Directed Trust Act, a power over a trust held by a nontrustee 
25is called a "power of direction." The holder of a power of direction is called a "trust 
26director." A trustee that is subject to a power of direction is called a "directed trustee." 
27The main contribution of the act is to address the many complications created by giving a 
28power of direction to a trust director, including the fiduciary duty of a trust director and 
29the fiduciary duty of a directed trustee.
30Enabling Settlor Autonomy Consistent with Fiduciary Minimums. By validating 
31terms of a trust that grant a trust director a power of direction, the Uniform Directed Trust 
32Act promotes settlor autonomy in accordance with the principle of freedom of 
33disposition. At the same time, the act imposes a mandatory minimum of fiduciary duty on 
34both a directed trustee and a trust director in accordance with the traditional principle that 
35a trust is a fiduciary relationship. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 96 cmt. c 
36(2012) ("[F]or reasons of policy trust fiduciary law imposes limitations on the types and 
37degree of misconduct for which the trustee can be excused from liability.").
38Structure of the Act. The heart of the Uniform Directed Trust Act appears in 
Page 3 - 129LR0511(01)-11Sections 6 through 11, which address the powers and duties of a trust director and a 
2directed trustee. Sections 6 through 8 address the kinds of powers that the terms of a trust 
3can grant to a trust director and the default and mandatory fiduciary duties of the director. 
4Section 9 addresses the fiduciary duty of a directed trustee. Sections 10 and 11 further 
5elaborate the duties of a trust director and directed trustee, prescribing specific rules for 
6information sharing and monitoring among trust directors and trustees. Section 12 
7addresses cotrusteeship, enabling a settlor to apply the fiduciary standards of conduct for 
8a directed trust under this act to a cotrusteeship. The remaining sections address a variety 
9of important technical issues in this act's relationship to existing law and in the 
10administration of a directed trust, including rules of construction for recurring matters 
11that might be overlooked in the drafting of a directed trust.
12Fiduciary Duty in a Directed Trust. Under the Uniform Directed Trust Act, a 
13trust director has the same default and mandatory fiduciary duties as a trustee in a like 
14position and under similar circumstances (Section 8). In complying with a trust director's 
15exercise of a power of direction, a directed trustee is liable only for the trustee's own 
16"willful misconduct" (Section 9). The logic behind these rules is that in a directed trust 
17the trust director functions much like a trustee in an undirected trust. Accordingly, the 
18trust director should have the same duties as a trustee in the exercise or nonexercise of the 
19director's power of direction, and the fiduciary duty of the directed trustee is reduced with 
20respect to the director's power of direction. 
21In preserving some minimal fiduciary duty in a directed trustee, the drafting 
22committee was influenced by the prominent directed trust statute in Delaware, which 
23provides likewise. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, § 3313 (2017). The popularity of directed 
24trusts in Delaware establishes that a directed trust statute that preserves in a directed 
25trustee a duty to avoid "willful misconduct" is workable in practice. The drafting 
26committee therefore declined the suggestion that the Uniform Directed Trust Act should 
27eliminate the fiduciary duty of a directed trustee completely. 
28In summary, under the Uniform Directed Trust Act a beneficiary's main recourse 
29for misconduct by a trust director is an action against the director for breach of the 
30director's fiduciary duty to the beneficiary. The beneficiary also has recourse against a 
31directed trustee, but only to the extent of the trustee's own willful misconduct. Compared 
32with a non-directed trust in which a trustee holds all power over the trust, a directed trust 
33subject to this act provides for more aggregate fiduciary duties owed to a beneficiary. All 
34of the usual duties of trusteeship are preserved in the trust director, and in addition the 
35directed trustee has a duty to avoid willful misconduct.

37MAINE UNIFORM DIRECTED TRUST ACT
38§2101.  Short title
39This Part may be known and cited as "the Maine Uniform Directed Trust Act."
40Comment
Page 4 - 129LR0511(01)-11(This is Section 1 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
2This act governs an arrangement commonly known as a "directed trust." In a 
3directed trust, the terms of the trust grant a person other than a trustee a power over some 
4aspect of the trust's administration. Under this act, such a power is called a "power of 
5direction," the person that holds the power is called a "trust director," a trustee that is 
6subject to the power is called a "directed trustee," and the trust is a "directed trust" (see 
7Sections 2(5), (9), (3), and (2) respectively). This act applies to any arrangement that 
8exhibits the functional features of a directed trust within the meaning of this act, even if 
9the terms of the trust use other terminology, such as "trust protector," "trust advisor," or 
10"administrative trustee." 
11§2102.  Definitions

14Comment
15(This is Section 2 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
16(1) Breach of trust. The definition of "breach of trust" in paragraph (1) makes 
17clear that the term includes a breach by a trust director or a trustee of a duty imposed on 
18that director or trustee by the terms of the trust, this act, or other law pertaining to trusts. 
19Historically, the term has been used to reference a breach of duty by a trustee, as under 
20Uniform Trust Code § 1001(a) (2000) and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 93 (2012). By 
21expanding the meaning of the term to include a breach of duty by a trust director, this 
22paragraph resolves any doubt about whether such conduct is also a "breach of trust." 
23In defining a breach of trust to include a breach of a duty imposed by this act, it is 
24important to recognize that some of the duties imposed by this act are default rules that 
25may be varied by the terms of the trust. The drafting committee contemplated that a trust 
26director or a trustee would not be in breach of trust for conduct that was authorized by the 
27terms of a trust to the extent that those terms are permissible under this act or other 
28applicable law. 
29(2) Directed trust. Under paragraph (2), a "directed trust" is a trust for which the 
30terms of the trust grant a power of direction. A "power of direction" is defined by 
31paragraph (5).
32(3) Directed trustee. The definition of "directed trustee" in paragraph (3) refers 
33only to a trustee that is subject to direction by a trust director. A trustee that is subject to 
34direction by a cotrustee is not for that reason a directed trustee, as paragraphs (5) and (9) 
35exclude a person from being a trust director while that person is serving as trustee. The 
36term "directed trustee" thus includes many but not all trustees that in practice are 
37sometimes called "administrative trustees." Relations between multiple trustees are 
38governed by the law of cotrusteeship as modified by Section 12.
39(4) Person. The definition of "person" in paragraph (4) follows the current 
Page 6 - 129LR0511(01)-11Uniform Law Commission definition. 
2(5) Power of direction. The definition of "power of direction" in paragraph (5) is 
3expansive. It includes any "power over a trust" to the extent the power is exercisable at a 
4time the power holder is not serving as a trustee. A power of direction may be structured 
5as a power to direct the trustee in the exercise of the trustee's powers—for example, a 
6power to direct the trustee in the investment or management of the trust property. A 
7power of direction may also be structured as a power to act independently—for example, 
8by amending the terms of a trust or releasing a trustee from liability. 
9The definition includes a power only to the extent the power is exercisable at a 
10time the power holder is not serving as a trustee. The purpose of this limitation is to 
11exclude a person serving as trustee from the definition of a trust director, even though as 
12trustee the person will inevitably have a "power over a trust." A trust director, in other 
13words, is someone other than a trustee. The contribution of this act is to address the 
14complications created by giving a person other than a trustee—that is, a trust director—a 
15power over a trust. A power over a trust held by a trustee is governed by existing trust 
16fiduciary law. 
17The restriction in the definition to powers held by a person that is "not serving as 
18a trustee" is also designed to be consistent with the definition of "trustee" in paragraph 
19(10). Under paragraph (10), the term "trustee" includes an original, additional, and 
20successor trustee. The definition of power of direction thus clarifies that a person that 
21qualifies as a trustee under paragraph (10) by virtue of having served as an original 
22trustee in the past or having been named as a successor trustee in the future may 
23nevertheless be a "trust director" at a time when the person is not serving as a trustee. An 
24original trustee that has ceased serving as a trustee but continues to hold a power over 
25investments, for example, is a trust director under paragraph (5) even though the person 
26also qualifies as a trustee under paragraph (10). 
27The definition confirms that a power of direction may include a power over 
28"matters of trust administration" as well as a power over "investment, management, or 
29distribution of trust property." These examples are meant to illustrate the potential scope 
30of a power of direction rather than to limit it. In using the term "administration," the 
31drafting committee intended a meaning at least as broad as that found in the context of 
32determining a trust's "principal place of administration," such as under Section 3(b). The 
33drafting committee also intended the terms "investment, management, or distribution" to 
34have a meaning at least as broad as that found in Uniform Trust Code § 815(a)(2)(b) 
35(2000), which specifies a trustee's default powers. The comment to Section 6 provides 
36examples of the kinds of specific powers that the drafting committee contemplated would 
37fall within the definition of a power of direction.
38(6) Settlor. The definition of "settlor" in paragraph (6) follows Uniform Trust 
39Code § 103(15) (2004). 
40(7) State. The definition of "state" in paragraph (7) follows the current Uniform 
41Law Commission definition.
42(8) Terms of a trust. The definition of "terms of a trust" in paragraph (8) updates 
Page 7 - 129LR0511(01)-11the comparable definition in Uniform Trust Code § 103(18) (2004) to take notice of court 
2orders and nonjudicial settlement agreements, both of which are of growing practical 
3significance and are sometimes used to vary the terms of a trust from a settlor's original 
4intent. The definition also takes notice of a power in a trustee or a trust director to modify 
5the terms of a trust. 
6The expanded definition of "terms of a trust" in this paragraph is consistent with 
7the Restatement, which recognizes the possibility that the terms of a trust may later be 
8varied from the settlor's initial expression. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 76 cmt. 
9b(1) (2007) ("References … to the terms of the trust … also refer to trust terms as 
10reformed or modified by court decree, and as modified by the settlor or others or by 
11consent of all beneficiaries.") (internal cross-references omitted). 
12(9) Trust director. The definition of a "trust director" in paragraph (9) refers to a 
13person other than a serving trustee that is granted a power of direction by the terms of a 
14trust. Such a person is a trust director even if the terms of the trust or the parties call the 
15person a "trust adviser" or "trust protector" or otherwise purport to disclaim trust director 
16status. A person may be a trust director even if the person is a beneficiary or settlor of the 
17trust, though certain powers of a beneficiary and a settlor are excluded from the 
18application of this act by Section 5. 
19A serving trustee cannot be a "trust director" for the same reasons that under 
20paragraph (5) a power over a trust cannot be a "power of direction" while the person that 
21holds the power is serving as a trustee. Relations between multiple trustees are governed 
22by the law of cotrusteeship as modified by Section 12. 
23(10) Trustee. Following Uniform Trust Code § 103(20) (2004), paragraph (10) 
24provides that the term "trustee" includes an original, additional, and successor trustee, and 
25a cotrustee.
26§2103.  Application; principal place of administration
271.  Application.  This Act applies to a trust, whenever created, that has its principal 
28place of administration in this State, subject to the following rules:
29A.  If the trust was created before January 1, 2020, this Act applies only to a decision 
30or action occurring on or after January 1, 2020.
31B.  If the principal place of administration of the trust is changed to this State on or 
32after January 1, 2020, this Act applies only to a decision or action occurring on or 
33after the date of the change.
342.  Principal place of administration.  Without precluding other means to establish 
35a sufficient connection with the designated jurisdiction in a directed trust, terms of the 
36trust that designate the principal place of administration of the trust are valid and 
37controlling if:
38A.  A trustee's principal place of business is located in or a trustee is a resident of the 
39designated jurisdiction;
Page 8 - 129LR0511(01)-11B.  A trust director's principal place of business is located in or a trust director is a 
2resident of the designated jurisdiction; or
3C.  All or part of the administration occurs in the designated jurisdiction.
4Comment
5(This is Section 3 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
6Subsection (a). Subsection (a) addresses two matters. First, because powers and 
7duties in a directed trust are matters of trust administration, see Restatement (Second) of 
8Conflict of Laws § 271 cmt. a (1971), this subsection follows the prevailing conflict of 
9laws rule by linking application of this act to the trust's principal place of administration. 
10As with other matters of administration, the parties are protected against inconsistent 
11court orders by the common law principle of "primary supervision." See id. § 267 cmt. e. 
12Second, this subsection applies this act to all trusts administered in an enacting 
13state regardless of whether the trust was in existence on the effective date of this act. 
14However, under subsections (a)(1) and (2), this act applies only with respect to a decision 
15or action occurring on or after the effective date or, if the trust's principal place of 
16administration was changed to the enacting state after the effective date, only with respect 
17to a decision or action occurring on or after that change. Because some of the standards of 
18conduct prescribed by this act depart from Uniform Trust Code § 808 (2000) and 
19Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 75 (2007), the drafting committee reasoned that the act 
20should apply prospectively, following the model of Uniform Prudent Investor Act § 11 
21(1994).     
22Subsection (b). Subsection (b), which derives from Uniform Trust Code § 108(a) 
23(2000), establishes a safe harbor for a settlor's designation of the principal place of 
24administration for a directed trust. Such a designation is valid if (1) a trustee is located in 
25the designated jurisdiction, (2) a trust director is located in the designated jurisdiction, or 
26(3) at least some of the trust administration occurs in the designated jurisdiction. 
27Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3) reproduce without change the safe harbor prescribed by 
28Uniform Trust Code § 108(a) (2000). Subsection (b)(2) expands the safe harbor of 
29Section 108(a) to add the presence of a trust director as a sufficient connection with the 
30designated jurisdiction. 
31Other than the expansion in subsection (b)(2) of the Uniform Trust Code's safe 
32harbor for a settlor's designation of a trust's principal place of administration, the drafting 
33committee did not undertake to prescribe rules for ascertaining a trust's principal place of 
34administration. In this respect, the drafting committee followed the Uniform Trust Code 
35in "not attempt[ing] to further define principal place of administration." Uniform Trust 
36Code § 108 cmt. Accordingly, for a directed trust in an enacting state, just as for all trusts 
37in a Uniform Trust Code state, if the safe harbor of subsection (b) does not apply, the 
38question of a trust's principal place of administration will be governed by the state's then-
39existing law on principal place of administration. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of 
40Conflict of Laws §§ 271-72, 279 (1971).  
Page 9 - 129LR0511(01)-11§2104.  Common law and principles of equity
2The common law and principles of equity supplement this Act, except to the extent 
3modified by this Act or law of this State other than this Act.
4Comment
5(This is Section 4 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
6This section confirms that the common law and principles of equity remain 
7applicable to a directed trust except to the extent modified by this act or other law. For 
8example, other than the safe harbor under Section 3(b) for a term of a trust that designates 
9the trust's principal place of administration, the law of an enacting state by which 
10principal place of administration is determined would continue to apply to a directed 
11trust. Provisions such as this one are familiar from other uniform acts. See, e.g., Uniform 
12Powers of Appointment Act § 104 (2013); Uniform Trust Code § 106 (2000). The 
13drafting committee contemplated that, by ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, 
14other statutes pertaining to trusts such as the Uniform Trust Code (2000), Uniform Trust 
15Decanting Act (2015), Uniform Principal and Income Act (1997), and Uniform Prudent 
16Investor Act (1994), would continue to apply to a directed trust except as modified by this 
17act. 
18§2105.  Exclusions
191.  Power of appointment.  In this section, "power of appointment" means a power 
20that enables a person acting in a nonfiduciary capacity to designate a recipient of an 
21ownership interest in or another power of appointment over trust property.
222.  Exclusions.  This Act does not apply to a:
23A.  Power of appointment;
24B.  Power to appoint or remove a trustee or trust director;
25C.  Power of a settlor over a trust to the extent the settlor has a power to revoke the 
26trust;
27D.  Power of a beneficiary over a trust to the extent the exercise or nonexercise of the 
28power affects the beneficial interest of:
29(1)  The beneficiary; or
30(2)  Another beneficiary represented by the beneficiary under the Maine Uniform 
31Trust Code, sections 301 to 305 with respect to the exercise or nonexercise of the 
32power; or
33E.  Power over a trust if:
34(1)  The terms of the trust provide that the power is held in a nonfiduciary 
35capacity; and

8Comment
9(This is Section 5 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
10This section excludes five categories of powers that the drafting committee 
11concluded should not be covered by this act for reasons of policy, coverage by other law, 
12or both. Questions regarding a power that falls within one of these exclusions, such as the 
13duty of the holder of the power and the duty of a trustee or other person subject to the 
14power, are governed by law other than this act. 
15(1) Power of appointment. Subsection (b)(1) excludes a "power of appointment," 
16which is defined by subsection (a) to mean "a power that enables a person acting in a 
17nonfiduciary capacity to designate a recipient of an ownership interest in or another 
18power of appointment over trust property." This definition of "power of appointment" is 
19based on the definition in Uniform Powers of Appointment Act § 102(13) (2013). The 
20definition is consistent with what Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other 
21Donative Transfers § 17.1 cmt. g (2011), refers to as a "discretionary" power of 
22appointment, that is, one in which "the donee may exercise the power arbitrarily as long 
23as the exercise is within the scope of the power."
24Accordingly, if the terms of a trust purport to grant a person not serving as trustee 
25a nonfiduciary power to direct distributions of trust property, under this act that power 
26will be construed as a power of appointment governed by law other than this act, such as 
27the Uniform Powers of Appointment Act (2013) and Restatement (Third) of Property: 
28Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 17.1–23.1 (2011). 
29The exclusion prescribed by subsection (b)(1) applies only to a nonfiduciary 
30power of appointment. It does not apply to a fiduciary power of distribution. Thus, if the 
31terms of a trust grant a person a fiduciary power to direct a distribution of trust property, 
32and the power is exercisable while the person is not serving as trustee, then the power is a 
33power of direction subject to this act.
34To resolve doubt about whether a power over distribution is a power of 
35appointment or a power of direction, subsection (c) prescribes a rule of construction 
36under which a power over distribution is a power of appointment, and so is not held in a 
37fiduciary capacity, unless the terms of the trust provide that the power is held in a 
38fiduciary capacity. 
39A power in a serving trustee to designate a recipient of an ownership interest in 
40or a power of appointment over trust property can never be a power of direction, because 
Page 11 - 129LR0511(01)-11a serving trustee can never be a trust director (see Sections 2(5) and (9)). Whether a 
2power over distribution granted to a serving trustee is held in a fiduciary capacity 
3(making it a fiduciary distributive power) or is instead a nonfiduciary power of 
4appointment is governed by law other than this act, such as under Restatement (Third) of 
5Trusts § 50 cmt. a (2003).  
6(2) Power to appoint or remove. Subsection (b)(2) excludes "a power to appoint 
7or remove a trustee or trust director." This exclusion addresses the compelling suggestion 
8to the drafting committee that granting a person a power to appoint or remove a trustee is 
9a common drafting practice that arose separately from the phenomenon of directed trusts. 
10Under prevailing law, the only limit on the exercise of a power to appoint or remove a 
11trustee is that it "must conform to any valid requirements or limitations imposed by the 
12trust terms." Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. c (2003). If the terms of the trust do 
13not impose any requirements or limitations on the power to remove, then "it is 
14unnecessary for the holder to show cause" before exercising the power. Austin Wakeman 
15Scott, William Franklin Fratcher & Mark L. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts § 11.10.2 
16(5th ed. 2006). 
17(3) Revocable trust. Subsection (b)(3) excludes a power of a settlor over a trust to 
18the extent the settlor has a power to revoke the trust. The drafting committee intended that 
19this exception would apply only to that portion of a trust over which the settlor has a 
20power to revoke, that is, "to the extent" of the settlor's power to revoke. 
21Because the settlor of a revocable trust may at any time revoke the trust and take 
22back the trust property, under modern law, including Uniform Trust Code § 603(a) 
23(2004), the trustee's duties run to the settlor rather than to the beneficiaries. The trustee 
24must "comply with a direction of the settlor even though the direction is contrary to the 
25terms of the trust or the trustee's normal fiduciary duties." Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 
2674(1)(a)(i) (2007). 
27Without the exclusion of this subsection, the definitions contained in paragraphs 
28(3), (5), and (9) of Section 2 could have been read to transform a settlor's power over a 
29revocable trust into fiduciary powers of a trust director, thus subjecting the settlor to the 
30fiduciary duties of a trust director under Section 8 and the trustee to the modified 
31fiduciary duties of a directed trustee under Sections 9 through 11. 
32To the extent that a conservator or agent of the settlor may exercise the settlor's 
33power to revoke, as under Uniform Trust Code § 602(e)–(f) (2001), subsection (b)(3) of 
34this section would apply to the conservator or agent. A nonfiduciary power in a person 
35other than the settlor to withdraw the trust property is a power of appointment that would 
36fall within subsection (b)(1).
37(4) Power of a beneficiary. Paragraph (4) excludes a power of a beneficiary to the 
38extent that the exercise or nonexercise of the power affects (A) the beneficial interest of 
39the beneficiary, or (B) the beneficial interest of another beneficiary who is represented by 
40the beneficiary under virtual representation law. 
41Subparagraph (A) follows from traditional law, under which "[a] power that is for 
42the sole benefit of the person holding the power is not a fiduciary power." Restatement 
Page 12 - 129LR0511(01)-11(Third) of Trusts § 75 cmt. d (2007). Thus, for example, a power in a beneficiary to 
2release a trustee from a claim by the beneficiary is excluded from this act. To the extent 
3the power affects another person, however, then it is not for the sole benefit of the person 
4holding the power. Hence, a power over a trust held by a beneficiary may be a power of 
5direction subject to this act if it affects the beneficial interest of another beneficiary. For 
6example, a power in a beneficiary to release the trustee from a claim by another 
7beneficiary is not excluded by this paragraph unless the power to bind the other 
8beneficiary arises by reason of virtual representation. 
9The same rules apply if the beneficiary's power is jointly held. Thus, for example, 
10if the terms of a trust provide that a trustee may be released from liability by a majority of 
11the beneficiaries, and a majority of the beneficiaries grants such a release, then those 
12beneficiaries would be acting as trust directors to the extent the release bound other 
13beneficiaries by reason of the power other than by virtual representation. This act would 
14therefore reverse the result in Vena v. Vena, 899 N.E.2d 522 (Ill. App. 2008), in which 
15the court refused to enforce a provision for release of a trustee by a majority of the 
16beneficiaries on the grounds that the minority beneficiaries did not have recourse against 
17the majority for an abusive release. Under this act, the minority beneficiaries would have 
18recourse against the majority for breach of their fiduciary duty as trust directors. 
19The carve-out for virtual representation in subparagraph (B) reflects the drafting 
20committee's intent not to impose the fiduciary rules of this act on top of the law of virtual 
21representation, which contains its own limits and safeguards. Without the exclusion of 
22this subsection, the definitions contained in paragraphs (5) and (9) of Section 2 could 
23have been read to transform a beneficiary who represented another beneficiary by virtual 
24representation into a trust director.
25By way of illustration, under Uniform Trust Code § 304 (2000), a beneficiary 
26who suffers from an incapacitating case of Alzheimer's disease may sometimes be 
27represented by another beneficiary in litigation against a trustee for breach of trust. In 
28such a case, paragraph (4) of this section prevents the beneficiary who represents the 
29beneficiary with Alzheimer's from being a trust director. Instead, the safeguards provided 
30by the law of virtual representation will apply. Under § 304, for example, the 
31representative beneficiary and the beneficiary with Alzheimer's disease must have "a 
32substantially identical interest with respect to the particular question or dispute," and have 
33"no conflict of interest" with each other. 
34(5) The settlor's tax objectives. Subsection (b)(5) excludes a power if (A) the 
35terms of the trust provide that the power is held in a nonfiduciary capacity, and (B) the 
36power must be held in a nonfiduciary capacity to achieve the settlor's tax objectives under 
37federal tax law. This exclusion is responsive to multiple suggestions to the drafting 
38committee that certain powers held by a person other than a trustee must be nonfiduciary 
39to achieve the settlor's federal tax objectives. 
40For example, to ensure that a trust is a grantor trust for federal income tax 
41purposes, a common practice is to include in the trust instrument a provision that allows 
42the settlor or another person to substitute assets of the trust for assets of an equivalent 
43value, exercisable in a nonfiduciary capacity. If the power to substitute assets is 
44exercisable in a fiduciary capacity, the power will not cause the trust to be a grantor trust. 
Page 13 - 129LR0511(01)-11Without the exception of subsection (b)(5), therefore, this common drafting practice 
2might no longer ensure grantor trust status in a state that enacts this Act, and the tax status 
3of existing trusts with such a provision would be thrown into disarray.
4In light of the evolving nature of tax planning, the frequency of amendments to 
5the tax law, and the potential for disagreement about which powers must be nonfiduciary 
6to achieve the settlor's federal tax objectives, the drafting committee reasoned that a 
7standard referring broadly to a settlor's tax objectives was preferable to a prescribed list of 
8sections of the tax code. 
9The drafting committee deliberately opted to reference tax objectives only under 
10federal law, thereby excluding tax objectives under state law. The concern was that some 
11states levy a tax on income in a trust if the trust has a fiduciary in the state. If this 
12exclusion reached state tax law, then in such a state a trust director could argue that the 
13director is not a fiduciary, because the settlor would not have wanted the trust to pay 
14income tax. The consequence would be to negate fiduciary status for virtually all trust 
15directors in those states. The purpose of this exception is to protect normal and customary 
16estate planning techniques, not to allow circumvention of the central policy choice 
17encoded in Section 8 that a trust director is generally subject to the same default and 
18mandatory fiduciary duties as a similarly situated trustee. 
19§2106.  Powers of trust director
201.  Power of direction.  Subject to section 2107, the terms of a trust may grant a 
21power of direction to a trust director.
222.  Powers of trust director.  Unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise: 
23A.  A trust director may exercise any further power appropriate to the exercise or 
24nonexercise of a power of direction granted to the director under subsection 1; and
25B.  Trust directors with joint powers shall act by majority decision.
26Comment
27(This is Section 6 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
28Validating a trust director. Subsection (a) validates a provision for a trust 
29director in the terms of a trust. This subsection does not provide any powers to a trust 
30director by default. Nor does it specify the scope of a power of direction. The existence 
31and scope of a power of direction must instead be specified by the terms of a trust. A trust 
32director may be named by the terms of the trust, by a procedure prescribed by the terms 
33of the trust, or in accordance with Section 16(6). 
34Breadth of subsection (a). Without limiting the definition of a "power of 
35direction" in Section 2(5), the drafting committee specifically contemplated that 
36subsection (a) would validate terms of a trust that grant a power to a trust director to:
37direct investments, including a power to:
38oacquire, dispose of, exchange, or retain an investment; 
39omake or take loans;
Page 14 - 129LR0511(01)-11ovote proxies for securities held in trust;
2oadopt a particular valuation of trust property or determine the 
3frequency or methodology of valuation;
4oadjust between principal and income or convert to a unitrust;
5omanage a business held in the trust; or
6oselect a custodian for trust assets;
7modify, reform, terminate, or decant a trust;
8direct a trustee's or another director's delegation of the trustee's or other 
9director's powers;
10change the principal place of administration, situs, or governing law of 
11the trust;
12ascertain the happening of an event that affects the administration of the 
13trust; 
14determine the capacity of a trustee, settlor, director, or beneficiary of the 
15trust;
16determine the compensation to be paid to a trustee or trust director; 
17prosecute, defend, or join an action, claim, or judicial proceeding relating 
18to the trust;
19grant permission before a trustee or another director may exercise a 
20power of the trustee or other director; or
21release a trustee or another trust director from liability for an action 
22proposed or previously taken by the trustee or other director.
23This subsection does not, however, override the background law that regulates 
24the formation of a trust, such as the requirements that a trust be lawful, not contrary to 
25public policy, and possible to achieve. See, e.g., Uniform Trust Code § 404 (2000); 
26Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 29–30 (2003).
27Pet and other noncharitable purpose trust enforcers. Statutes in every state 
28validate a trust for a pet animal and certain other noncharitable purposes. Following 
29Uniform Probate Code § 2-907(c)(4) (1993) and Uniform Trust Code §§ 408(b) and 
30409(2) (2000), most of these statutes authorize enforcement of the trust by a person 
31named in the terms of the trust. In a state that enacts this act, such a person would be a 
32trust director. 
33Exclusions. Like the other provisions of this act, this section does not apply to 
34matters that are excluded by Section 5. Thus, because Sections 5(b)(1)-(2) exclude a 
35"power of appointment," and a "power to appoint or remove a trustee or trust director," 
36subsection 6(a) does not authorize the granting of such powers. Instead, such a power is 
37governed by law other than this act.
38Subsection (b). Subsection (b) prescribes two rules of construction that apply 
39unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise. 
40(1) Further appropriate powers. Subsection (b)(1) prescribes a default rule under 
41which a trust director may exercise any "further" power that is "appropriate" to the 
42director's exercise of the director's express powers granted by the terms of the trust under 
43subsection (a). The term "appropriate" is drawn from Uniform Trust Code § 815(a)(2)(B) 
Page 15 - 129LR0511(01)-11(2000). Appropriateness should be judged in relation to the purpose for which the power 
2was granted and the function being carried out by the director. Examples of further 
3powers that might be appropriate include a power to: (1) incur reasonable costs and direct 
4indemnification for those costs; (2) make a report or accounting to a beneficiary or other 
5interested party; (3) direct a trustee to issue a certification of trust under Uniform Trust 
6Code § 1013 (2000); (4) prosecute, defend, or join an action, claim, or judicial proceeding 
7relating to a trust; or (5) employ a professional to assist or advise the director in the 
8exercise or nonexercise of the director's powers. 
9Delegation by trust director. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate under 
10subsection (b)(1) for a trust director to exercise a further power to delegate the director's 
11powers, much as it may sometimes be appropriate for a trustee to delegate its powers. 
12Under Section 8, a trust director is subject to the same fiduciary duty regarding delegation 
13as a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances. In most states, therefore, a 
14trust director would be required to exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in 
15selecting, instructing, and monitoring an agent, and a director that did so would not be 
16liable for the action of the agent. In accordance with prevailing law governing delegation 
17by a trustee, see, e.g., Uniform Trust Code § 807 (2000); Uniform Prudent Investor Act § 
189 (1994); Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 80 (2007), the drafting committee contemplated 
19that in performing a function delegated by a trust director, the agent would owe a duty to 
20exercise reasonable care. 
21Trust director's standing to sue. Subsection (b)(1) addresses the situation that 
22arose in Schwartz v. Wellin, No. 2:13-CV-3595-DCN, 2014 WL 1572767 (D.S.C. Apr. 
2317, 2014). The court held that a trust director, which the terms of the trust referred to as a 
24"trust protector," lacked standing to bring a lawsuit under Rule 17(a)(1) of the Federal 
25Rules of Civil Procedure, because the director was neither a real party in interest nor a 
26party that could pursue a claim if not a real party in interest. 
27In some circumstances, subsection (b)(1) may produce a different outcome. Rule 
2817(a)(1) allows a party to participate in litigation even if the party is not a real party in 
29interest if the party is "authorized by statute." Subsection (b)(1) supplies the requisite 
30statutory authorization if participating in a lawsuit would be "appropriate" to a director's 
31exercise or nonexercise of a power granted by the terms of the trust under subsection (a). 
32It would normally be "appropriate," for example, for a trust director to bring an action 
33against a directed trustee if the trustee refused to comply with a director's exercise of a 
34power of direction. The requisite statutory authorization might also come from subsection 
35(a) if the terms of the trust expressly confer a power of litigation on a director.  
36(2) Majority decision. Subsection (b)(2) provides a default rule of majority action 
37for multiple trust directors with "joint powers," such as a three-person committee with a 
38power of direction over investment or distribution. Majority action is the prevailing 
39default for cotrustees. See Uniform Trust Code § 703(a) (2000); Restatement (Third) of 
40Trusts § 39 (2003). In the event of a deadlock among trust directors with joint powers, by 
41analogy to a deadlock among cotrustees, a court could "direct exercise of the [joint] 
42power or take other action to break the deadlock." Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 39 
43cmt. e (2003). 
44The duty and liability of a trust director is governed by Section 8, which applies 
Page 16 - 129LR0511(01)-11the fiduciary duty of trusteeship to a trust director. Thus, under Section 8(a)(1)(B), a trust 
2director that holds a power of direction jointly with a trustee or another trust director 
3would be subject to the fiduciary duty of a cotrustee. 
4§2107.  Limitations on trust director
5A trust director is subject to the same rules as a trustee in a like position and under 
6similar circumstances in the exercise or nonexercise of a power of direction or further 
7power under section 2106, subsection 2, paragraph A regarding:
81.  Medicaid payback provision.  A payback provision in the terms of a trust 
9necessary to comply with the reimbursement requirements of Medicaid law in Section 
101917 of the federal Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Section 1396p(d)(4)(A); 
11and
122.  Charitable interest.  A charitable interest in the trust, including notice regarding 
13the interest to the Attorney General.
14Comment
15(This is Section 7 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
16This section applies to a trust director the same rules that apply to a trustee in two 
17specific situations in which many states have particular regulatory interests. The first, in 
18paragraph (1), concerns a payback provision necessary to comply with the reimbursement 
19requirements of Medicaid law in a trust for a beneficiary with a disability. The second, in 
20paragraph (2), concerns a charitable interest in a trust. 
21In both circumstances, this section imposes all the same rules that would apply to 
22a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances. For example, many states 
23require a trustee to give notice to the Attorney General before taking certain actions with 
24respect to a charitable interest in a trust. Some states also disempower a trustee from 
25taking certain actions with respect to a payback provision in a trust meant to comply with 
26the reimbursement requirements of Medicaid law.  
27The drafting committee referenced "rules" rather than "duties" in order to make 
28clear that this section absorbs every provision of state law in the areas specified by 
29paragraphs (1) and (2), regardless of whether the law in these areas is classified as a duty, 
30a limit on a trustee's powers, a regulation, or otherwise. In referencing rules, rather than 
31duties, this section stands in contrast to Section 8(a) and the other sections of this act that 
32apply a trustee's duties to a trust director. Section 8(a) and these other sections absorb 
33only duties of a fiduciary nature, whereas this section absorbs all rules, whether fiduciary, 
34regulatory, or otherwise. Also unlike Section 8(a), this section applies only to two limited 
35subject areas, rather than to the whole range of a director's possible conduct.
36§2108.  Duty and liability of trust director
371.  Duties and liabilities.  Subject to subsection 2, with respect to a power of 
38direction or further power under section 2106, subsection 2, paragraph A:
Page 17 - 129LR0511(01)-11A.  A trust director has the same fiduciary duty and liability in the exercise or 
2nonexercise of the power:
3(1)  If the power is held individually, as a sole trustee in a like position and under 
4similar circumstances; or
5(2)  If the power is held jointly with a trustee or another trust director, as a 
6cotrustee in a like position and under similar circumstances; and
7B.  The terms of the trust may vary a trust director's duty or liability to the same 
8extent the terms of the trust could vary the duty or liability of a trustee in a like 
9position and under similar circumstances.
102.  Health care provider.  Unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise, if a trust 
11director is licensed, certified or otherwise authorized or permitted by law other than this 
12Act to provide health care in the ordinary course of the director's business or practice of a 
13profession, to the extent the director acts in that capacity, the director has no duty or 
14liability under this Act.
153.  Additional duties and liabilities.  The terms of a trust may impose a duty or 
16liability on a trust director in addition to the duties and liabilities under this section.
17Comment
18(This is Section 8 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
19Duty and liability of a trust director. This section addresses the duty and liability 
20of a trust director. It should be read in conjunction with Section 10, which governs 
21information sharing among directed trustees and trust directors, and Section 11, which 
22eliminates certain duties to monitor, inform, or give advice. The drafting committee 
23contemplated that this section, along with Sections 10 and 11, would prescribe the 
24mandatory minimum fiduciary duties of a trust director, displacing any contrary 
25mandatory minimum such as under Uniform Trust Code § 105 (2005).
26Subsection (a). Subsection (a) imposes the same fiduciary duties on a trust 
27director that would apply to a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances. A 
28trust director with a power to make or direct investments, for example, has the same 
29duties that would apply to a trustee with the same power, including a duty to act 
30prudently, in the sole interest of the beneficiaries, and impartially with due regard for the 
31respective interests of the beneficiaries. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 77–79, 
3290–92 (2007). The theory behind subsection (a) is that if a trust director has a power of 
33direction, the director is the most appropriate person to bear the duty associated with the 
34exercise or nonexercise of that power. Put differently, in a directed trust, a trust director 
35functions much like a trustee in a non-directed trust, and thus should have the same duties 
36as a trustee. 
37Accordingly, subsection (a)(1) sets the default duties of a trust director by 
38absorbing the default duties that would ordinarily apply to a trustee in a like position and 
39under similar circumstances. Subsection (a)(2) sets the mandatory minimum duties of a 
40trust director by absorbing the mandatory minimum duties that the terms of a trust cannot 
41vary for a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances. The default and 
Page 18 - 129LR0511(01)-11mandatory rules applicable to a trustee include those prescribed by the other provisions of 
2this act.
3In making a trust director a fiduciary, subsection (a) follows the great majority of 
4the existing state directed trust statutes. Subsection (a) is more specific than many state 
5statutes, however, as the existing statutes tend to say only that a trust director is a 
6"fiduciary," without specifying which kind of fiduciary or which fiduciary duties apply. 
7Subsection (a) provides greater clarity by specifically absorbing the fiduciary duty of a 
8similarly situated trustee. 
9Absorption of existing trust fiduciary law. Subsection (a) operates by absorbing 
10existing state law rather than by inventing a new body of law. Absorbing existing state 
11law in this manner offers several advantages. First, it avoids the need to spell out the 
12entirety of trust fiduciary law. That is, it avoids the need to replicate something like 
13Article 8 of the Uniform Trust Code for trust directors. Second, absorbing the trust 
14fiduciary law of each enacting state accommodates diversity across the states in the 
15particulars of a trustee's default and mandatory fiduciary duties, such as the duties to 
16diversify and to give information to the beneficiaries, both of which have become 
17increasingly differentiated across the states. Third, absorption allows for changes to the 
18law of a trustee's fiduciary duties to be absorbed automatically into the duties of a trust 
19director without need for periodic conforming revisions to this act.
20Varied circumstances of trust directors. In applying the law of trustee fiduciary 
21duties to a trust director, a court must make use of the flexibility built into fiduciary law. 
22Courts have long applied the duties of loyalty and prudence across a wide array of 
23circumstances, including many different kinds of trusts as well as other fiduciary 
24relationships, such as corporations and agencies. Fiduciary principles are thus amenable 
25to application in a context-specific manner that is sensitive to the particular circumstances 
26and structure of each directed trust. In assessing the actions of a director that holds a 
27power to modify a trust, for example, a court should apply the standards of loyalty and 
28prudence in a manner that is appropriate to the particular context, including the trust's 
29terms and purposes and the director's particular powers. 
30The trust director's duty of disclosure. Under subsection (a), a trust director is 
31subject to the same duties of disclosure as a trustee in a like position and under similar 
32circumstances. For example, if a trust director intends to direct a nonroutine transaction, 
33to change "investment … strategies," or to take "significant actions … involving hard-to-
34value assets or special sensitivity to beneficiaries," the director is under a duty of 
35affirmative advance disclosure, just like a trustee. Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 82 cmt. 
36d (2007). A trust director's disclosure duties are limited, however, by Section 11, which 
37eliminates certain duties to monitor, inform, or give advice.
38Sole versus joint powers. Under subsection (a), a trust director has the same 
39fiduciary duties as a sole trustee when a power of direction is held individually and the 
40same fiduciary duties as a cotrustee when a power of direction is held jointly. A trust 
41director that individually holds a power to amend the trust, for example, does not have the 
42duties of a cotrustee to monitor the actions of the trustee concerning investments or the 
43actions of another trust director concerning the determination of a beneficiary's capacity. 
Page 19 - 129LR0511(01)-11Subject to Section 11, a trust director that holds a power of direction jointly with 
2a trustee or another trust director, by contrast, has the duties of a cotrustee regarding the 
3actions of that trustee or other trust director that are within the scope of the jointly held 
4power. Thus, a trust director that jointly exercises a power to direct investments with 
5other trust directors has the same fiduciary duties as a cotrustee regarding its own actions 
6and the actions of the other directors with respect to the power. Under subsection (a)(2), a 
7settlor may vary the duty and liability of a trust director that holds a power of direction 
8jointly to the same extent the settlor could vary the duty and liability of a cotrustee under 
9Section 12 or otherwise.
10Springing powers without a duty to monitor. The drafting committee 
11contemplated that a settlor could construct a trust director's power to be springing such 
12that the director would not be under a continuous obligation to monitor the administration 
13of the trust. For example, a settlor could grant a trust director a power to direct a 
14distribution, but only if the director was requested to do so by a beneficiary. A director 
15holding such a power would not be under a duty to act unless requested to do so by a 
16beneficiary. Moreover, because under subsection (a)(2) a settlor can vary the fiduciary 
17duties of a trust director to the same extent that the settlor could vary the fiduciary duties 
18of a trustee, under Uniform Trust Code § 105(b)(2) (2004) the terms of a trust could 
19waive all of the director's otherwise applicable duties other than the duty "to act in good 
20faith and in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the 
21beneficiaries." A director with a power to direct a distribution upon a beneficiary's 
22request, for example, would be subject to this mandatory duty when it responds to a 
23beneficiary's request.  
24Extended discretion. Under subsection (a), if the terms of a trust give a trust 
25director extended discretion, such as "sole," "absolute," or "uncontrolled" discretion, 
26those terms would have the same effect on the duty and liability of the director as they 
27would have for a trustee. Under prevailing law, a trustee with extended discretion may 
28not "act in bad faith or for some purpose or motive other than to accomplish the purposes 
29of the discretionary power." Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 50 cmt. c (2003); see also 
30Uniform Trust Code § 814(a) (2004). 
31Exculpation or exoneration. A trust director is likewise subject to the same rules 
32as a trustee with regard to an exculpation or exoneration clause. Under prevailing law, 
33such as Uniform Trust Code § 1008 (2000) and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 96 
34(2012), an exculpation or exoneration clause cannot protect a trustee against liability for 
35acting in bad faith or with reckless indifference. Under subsection (a)(2) of this section, 
36the same rules would apply to an exculpation or exoneration clause for a trust director. 
37Thus, if the terms of a trust provide that a director can never be liable to a beneficiary, 
38then the trust director would have the same liability as a trustee would have under a 
39similar exculpatory clause.
40Directed director. The terms of a trust may provide that a trust director has a 
41power over a trust that requires another director to comply with the director's exercise or 
42nonexercise of the power. In other words, a director may have the power to direct another 
43director. In such a trust, subsection (a)(1) would absorb for the directed director the same 
44fiduciary duties that would apply to a directed trustee. A directed director would thus be 
Page 20 - 129LR0511(01)-11subject to the willful misconduct standard that Section 9 applies to a directed trustee. 
2Under subsection (a)(2), the terms of a trust may vary the duty of a directed director to 
3the same extent they could vary the duty of a directed trustee.
4Subsection (b)—health-care professionals. Subsection (b) refers to a trust director 
5who is "licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by law … to provide 
6health care in the ordinary course of the director's business or practice of a profession." 
7This phrasing is based on the definition of "health-care provider" in Uniform Health-Care 
8Decisions Act § 1(8) (1993). To the extent that a trust director acts in the director's 
9business or practice of a profession to provide health care, the director is relieved from 
10duty and liability under this act unless the terms of the trust provide otherwise. 
11This subsection addresses the concern that a health-care professional might refuse 
12appointment as a trust director if such service would expose the professional to fiduciary 
13duty under this act. For example, the terms of a trust might call for a health-care 
14professional to determine the capacity or sobriety of a beneficiary or the capacity of a 
15settlor. In making such a determination, under subsection (b) the health-care professional 
16would not be subject to duty or liability under this act. 
17Although the professional would not be subject to duty or liability under this act, 
18the professional would remain subject to any rules and regulations otherwise applicable to 
19the professional, such as the rules of medical ethics. The professional would also be 
20subject to the other provisions of this act that do not create a duty or liability, such as the 
21rules of construction prescribed by Sections 6(b) and 16. Moreover, a trustee subject to a 
22direction by a health-care professional under subsection (b) of this section is still subject 
23to the duties under Section 9 to take reasonable action to comply with the professional's 
24direction and to avoid willful misconduct in doing so. 
25Subsection (c)—no ceiling on duties. Subsection (c) confirms that the duties 
26under this section are defaults and minimums, not ceilings. The terms of a trust may 
27impose further duties in addition to those prescribed by this section. 
28§2109.  Duty and liability of directed trustee
291.  Reasonable action to comply.  Subject to subsection 2, a directed trustee shall 
30take reasonable action to comply with a trust director's exercise or nonexercise of a power 
31of direction or further power under section 2106, subsection 2, paragraph A, and the 
32trustee is not liable for the action.
332.  No compliance if willful misconduct.  A directed trustee may not comply with a 
34trust director's exercise or nonexercise of a power of direction or further power under 
35section 2106, subsection 2, paragraph A to the extent that by complying the trustee would 
36engage in willful misconduct.
373.  Release from liability not effective.  An exercise of a power of direction under 
38which a trust director may release a trustee or another trust director from liability for 
39breach of trust is not effective if:
40A.  The breach involved the trustee's or other director's willful misconduct;
Page 21 - 129LR0511(01)-11B.  The release was induced by improper conduct of the trustee or other director in 
2procuring the release; or
3C.  At the time of the release, the director did not know the material facts relating to 
4the breach. 
54.  Petition court for instructions.  A directed trustee that has reasonable doubt 
6about its duty under this section may petition the Probate Court or the Superior Court for 
7instructions.
85.  Additional duty or liability.  The terms of a trust may impose a duty or liability 
9on a directed trustee in addition to the duties and liabilities under this section.
10Comment
11(This is Section 9 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
12Duties of a directed trustee. This section addresses the duty and liability of a 
13directed trustee. It should be read in conjunction with Section 10, which governs 
14information sharing among directed trustees and trust directors, and Section 11, which 
15eliminates certain duties to monitor, inform, or advise. The drafting committee 
16contemplated that this section, along with Sections 10 and 11, would prescribe the 
17mandatory minimum fiduciary duties of a directed trustee, displacing any contrary 
18mandatory minimum such as under Uniform Trust Code § 105 (2005).
19Subsection (a)—duty to take reasonable action; nonliability other than under 
20subsection (b). Subject to subsection (b), subsection (a) requires a directed trustee to take 
21reasonable action to comply with a trust director's exercise or nonexercise of the director's 
22power of direction or further power under Section 6(b)(1) and provides that the trustee is 
23not liable for so acting. 
24The duty of a trustee in subsection (a) to take reasonable action depends on 
25context. A power of direction under which a trust director may give a trustee an express 
26direction will require the trustee to comply by following the direction. A power that 
27requires a trustee to obtain permission from a trust director before acting imposes a duty 
28on the trustee to obtain the required permission. A power that allows a director to amend 
29the trust imposes a duty on the trustee to take reasonable action to facilitate the 
30amendment and then comply with its terms. The duty prescribed by subsection (a) is to 
31take reasonable action to comply with whatever the terms of the trust require of a trustee 
32in connection with a trust director's exercise or nonexercise of the director's power of 
33direction or further power under Section 6(b)(1). 
34A trustee's duty to take reasonable action is limited by the scope of the trust 
35director's power of direction. A directed trustee should not comply with a direction that is 
36outside of the director's power of direction and beyond the director's further powers under 
37Section 6(b)(1). To do so would violate the trustee's duty under subsection (a) and the 
38trustee's background duty to act in accordance with the terms of the trust. See, e.g., 
39Uniform Trust Code § 105(b)(2) (amended 2005) (making mandatory "the duty of a 
40trustee to act … in accordance with the terms … of the trust"); Restatement (Third) of 
41Trusts § 76 (2007) ("The trustee has a duty to administer the trust … in accordance with 
Page 22 - 129LR0511(01)-11the terms of the trust."). For example, an attempt by a director to exercise a power of 
2direction in a form contrary to that required by the terms of the trust, such as an oral 
3direction if the terms of the trust require a writing, is not within the trust director's power.
4Subsection (a) requires a trustee to act reasonably as it carries out the acts 
5necessary to comply with a trust director's exercise or nonexercise of the director's 
6powers. If a trust director with a power to direct investments directs the trustee to 
7purchase a particular security, for example, the trustee must take care to ensure that the 
8security is purchased within a reasonable time and at reasonable cost and must refrain 
9from self-dealing and conflicts of interest in doing so. 
10The duty to take reasonable action under subsection (a) does not, however, 
11impose a duty to ensure that the substance of the direction is reasonable. To the contrary, 
12subject to subsection (b), a trustee that takes reasonable action to comply with a power of 
13direction is not liable for so acting even if the substance of the direction is unreasonable. 
14In other words, subject to the willful misconduct rule of subsection (b), a trustee is liable 
15only for its own breach of trust in executing a direction, and not for the director's breach 
16of trust in giving the direction. Returning to the example of a direction to purchase a 
17security, the trustee is not required to assess whether the purchase of the security would 
18be prudent in relation to the trust's investment portfolio; the trustee is only required to 
19execute the purchase reasonably.
20Powers jointly held with a trust director. A trustee may hold a power of direction 
21jointly with a trust director. For example, the terms of a trust may confer a power to 
22determine the capacity of a beneficiary upon a committee of people, and the committee 
23may include both the trustee and the beneficiary's son, who is a trust director. When a 
24trustee holds a power jointly with a trust director, the trustee continues to have the normal 
25duties of a trustee regarding its own exercise or nonexercise of the joint power. 
26Subsection (a), in other words, does not relieve the trustee from the trustee's normal 
27duties as to powers that belong directly to the trustee, including powers held jointly with a 
28trust director. In deciding how to vote as a member of the committee to determine the 
29beneficiary's capacity, for example, the trustee would be subject to the same duties as if it 
30held its power jointly with another trustee instead of with another trust director. 
31A trustee's participation in joint decisionmaking with a trust director, however, 
32must be distinguished from the trustee's execution of those joint decisions. Although the 
33trustee is subject to the normal fiduciary duties of trusteeship in making a decision jointly 
34with a trust director, the trustee is subject to the reduced duty of subsections (a) and (b) in 
35executing the decision. Returning to the example of a committee including a trustee with 
36power to determine a beneficiary's capacity, the trustee has its normal fiduciary duties in 
37deciding how to cast its vote about whether the beneficiary lacks capacity. But the trustee 
38has only the duties prescribed by subsections (a) and (b) when the trustee takes action to 
39comply with the decision of the committee. 
40Powers to veto or approve. The terms of a trust may give a trust director a power 
41to veto or approve the actions of a trustee. A trustee, for example, may have the power to 
42invest trust property, subject to the power of a trust director to review and override the 
43trustee's decision. A trustee that operates under this kind of veto or approval power has 
44the normal duties of a trustee regarding the trustee's exercise of its own powers, but has 
Page 23 - 129LR0511(01)-11only the duties of a directed trustee regarding the trust director's exercise of its power to 
2veto or approve. Thus, the trustee would be subject to the normal duty of prudence in 
3deciding which investments to propose to a director, but then would be subject only to the 
4willful misconduct rule of subsection (b) in choosing whether to comply with the 
5director's veto or disapproval of the proposed investments.  
6Subsection (b)—willful misconduct. Subsection (b) provides an exception to the 
7duty of compliance prescribed by subsection (a). Under subsection (b), a trustee must not 
8comply with a trust director's exercise or nonexercise of a power of direction or a further 
9power under Section 6(b)(1) to the extent that by complying the trustee would engage in 
10"willful misconduct." 
11The willful misconduct standard in subsection (b) is to be distinguished from the 
12duty to take reasonable action in subsection (a). The reasonable action rule of subsection 
13(a) applies to the manner by which a trustee complies with a power of direction. The 
14willful misconduct standard of subsection (b) applies to the decision of whether to 
15comply with a power of direction.
16The willful misconduct standard in subsection (b) is a mandatory minimum. The 
17terms of a trust may not reduce a trustee's duty below the standard of willful misconduct. 
18Terms of a trust that attempt to give a trustee no duty or to indicate that a trustee is not a 
19fiduciary or is an "excluded fiduciary" or other such language are not enforceable under 
20subsection (b). Instead, such provisions should be construed to provide for the willful 
21misconduct standard of subsection (b).
22The drafting committee settled upon the "willful misconduct" standard after a 
23review of the existing directed trust statutes. Roughly speaking, the existing statutes fall 
24into two groups. In one group, which constitutes a majority, are the statutes that provide 
25that a directed trustee has no duty or liability for complying with an exercise of a power 
26of direction. This group includes Alaska, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Dakota. 
27The policy rationale for these no duty statutes is that duty should follow power. If 
28a director has the exclusive authority to exercise a power of direction, then the director 
29should be the exclusive bearer of fiduciary duty in the exercise or nonexercise of the 
30power. Placing the exclusive duty on a director does not diminish the total duty owed to a 
31beneficiary, because a settlor of a directed trust could have chosen to make the trust 
32director the sole trustee instead. Thus, on greater-includes-the-lesser reasoning, a settlor 
33who could have named a trust director to serve instead as a trustee should also be able to 
34give the trust director the duties of the trustee. Under the no duty statutes, a beneficiary's 
35only recourse for misconduct by the trust director is an action against the director for 
36breach of the director's fiduciary duty to the beneficiary.
37In the other group of statutes, which includes Delaware, Illinois, Texas, and 
38Virginia, a directed trustee is not liable for complying with a direction of a trust director 
39unless by so doing the directed trustee would personally engage in "willful" or 
40"intentional" misconduct. The policy rationale for these statutes is that, because a trustee 
41stands at the center of a trust, the trustee must bear at least some duty even if the trustee is 
42acting under the direction of a director. Although the settlor could have made the trust 
43director the sole trustee, the settlor did not actually do so—and under traditional 
Page 24 - 129LR0511(01)-11understandings of trust law, a trustee must always be accountable to a beneficiary in some 
2way. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 96 cmt. c (2012) ("Notwithstanding the 
3breadth of language in a trust provision relieving a trustee from liability for breach of 
4trust, for reasons of policy trust fiduciary law imposes limitations on the types and degree 
5of misconduct for which the trustee can be excused from liability."). 
6The states in the second group also recognize, however, that to facilitate the 
7settlor's intent that the trust director rather than the directed trustee be the primary or even 
8sole decisionmaker, it is appropriate to reduce the trustee's duty below the usual level 
9with respect to a matter subject to a power of direction. Accordingly, under these statutes 
10a beneficiary's main recourse for misconduct by the trust director is an action against the 
11director for breach of the director's fiduciary duty to the beneficiary. The beneficiary also 
12has recourse against the trustee, but only if the trustee's compliance with the director's 
13exercise or nonexercise of the director's powers amounted to "willful misconduct" by the 
14trustee. Relative to a non-directed trust, this second approach has the effect of increasing 
15the total fiduciary duties owed to a beneficiary. All of the usual duties of trusteeship are 
16preserved in the trust director, but in addition the directed trustee has a duty to avoid 
17willful misconduct.  
18After extensive deliberation and debate, the drafting committee opted to follow 
19the second group of statutes on the grounds that this model is more consistent with 
20traditional fiduciary policy. The popularity of directed trusts in Delaware, which also 
21adopts the willful misconduct standard, establishes that a directed trust regime that 
22preserves a willful misconduct safeguard is workable and that a total elimination of duty 
23in a directed trustee is unnecessary to satisfy the needs of directed trust practice.  
24The willful misconduct standard prescribed by this subsection changes the policy 
25of Uniform Trust Code § 808 (2000), which is similar in substance to Restatement 
26(Third) of Trusts § 75 (2007). Section 808(b) provides:
27If the terms of a trust confer upon a person other than the settlor of a 
28revocable trust power to direct certain actions of the trustee, the trustee 
29shall act in accordance with an exercise of the power unless the 
30attempted exercise is manifestly contrary to the terms of the trust or the 
31trustee knows the attempted exercise would constitute a serious breach of 
32a fiduciary duty that the person holding the power owes to the 
33beneficiaries of the trust.
34In deciding to adopt a different standard, the drafting committee was deeply influenced 
35by the fact that a growing number of states that had previously adopted Section 808 have 
36since abandoned or modified it to follow one of the two other models discussed above. 
37The drafting committee was also strongly influenced by the fact that a review of every 
38existing specialized state statute on directed trusts showed that no state that has legislated 
39specifically on the issue of directed trustee fiduciary duties has chosen to follow Section 
40808.
41Subsection (c)—release by trust director. The terms of a trust may empower a 
42trust director to release a trustee or another trust director from liability for breach of trust. 
43If the director grants such a release, the trustee or other director is not liable to the extent 
Page 25 - 129LR0511(01)-11of the release. The terms of a trust may authorize such a release to be given at any time, 
2whether before or after the trustee or other director acts. The precise scope of a power of 
3release and the manner of its exercise depend on the terms of the trust.
4Although a settlor has wide latitude in designing a power of direction, subsection 
5(c) prescribes three mandatory safeguards that limit a director's power to release a trustee 
6or other director from liability. First, consistent with the policy of subsection (b), a trustee 
7or other director cannot be released for a breach that involves the trustee's or the other 
8director's own willful misconduct. Second, consistent with prevailing law governing a 
9release of a trustee by a beneficiary, a release by a trust director is not enforceable if it 
10was procured by the improper conduct of the trustee or other director. Third, again 
11consistent with prevailing law governing a release of a trustee by a beneficiary, a release 
12by a trust director is not enforceable if at the time of the release the director did not know 
13the material facts relating to the breach. The drafting committee based the second and 
14third of these safeguards on Uniform Trust Code § 1009 (2001), which is similar in 
15substance to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 97 (2012).
16Subsection (d)—petition for instructions. Subsection (d) confirms that, in 
17accordance with existing law, a directed trustee that has reasonable doubt about its duty 
18under this section may petition the court for instructions. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of 
19Trusts § 71 (2007) ("A trustee or beneficiary may apply to an appropriate court for 
20instructions regarding the administration or distribution of the trust if there is reasonable 
21doubt about the powers or duties of the trusteeship or about the proper interpretation of 
22the trust provisions."). The safe harbor of this subsection is permissive rather than 
23mandatory. Though a trustee may satisfy its duties by petitioning for instructions, this 
24subsection does not require a trustee to petition. 
25Subsection (e)—no ceiling on duties. Subsection (e) confirms that the duties 
26prescribed by this section are defaults and minimums, not ceilings. The terms of a trust 
27may impose further duties in addition to those prescribed by this section.
28§2110.  Duty to provide information to trust director or trustee
291.  Trustee's duty to provide information.  Subject to section 2111, a trustee shall 
30provide information to a trust director to the extent the information is reasonably related 
31to both:
32A.  The powers or duties of the trustee; and
33B.  The powers or duties of the director.
342.  Trust director's duty to provide information.  Subject to section 2111, a trust 
35director shall provide information to a trustee or another trust director to the extent the 
36information is reasonably related to both:
37A.  The powers or duties of the director; and
38B.  The powers or duties of the trustee or other director.
Page 26 - 129LR0511(01)-113.  Trustee acts in reliance.  A trustee that acts in reliance on information provided 
2by a trust director is not liable for a breach of trust to the extent the breach resulted from 
3the reliance, unless by so acting the trustee engages in willful misconduct.
44.  Trust director acts in reliance.  A trust director that acts in reliance on 
5information provided by a trustee or another trust director is not liable for a breach of 
6trust to the extent the breach resulted from the reliance, unless by so acting the trust 
7director engages in willful misconduct. 
8Comment
9(This is Section 10 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
10Subsections (a) and (b)—Duty to provide information. This section imposes 
11duties on trustees and trust directors to provide information to each other. Subsection (a) 
12imposes this duty on a directed trustee, and subsection (b) imposes this duty on a trust 
13director. The drafting committee contemplated that the duties created by this section 
14would provide trustees and trust directors with sufficient information to fulfill their 
15obligations under trust law as well as other law, including banking, securities, and tax 
16law.
17Disclosure to beneficiaries. This section governs disclosure of information to 
18trustees and trust directors. The duty of a trust director to disclose information to a 
19beneficiary is governed by Section 8, which prescribes the fiduciary duties of a trust 
20director, subject to Section 11. The duty of a trustee to disclose information to a 
21beneficiary is governed by the background law of an enacting state under Section 4 as 
22modified by Section 11, which limits a directed trustee's duty to inform a beneficiary 
23about the actions of a trust director.
24Reasonableness. This section relies heavily on the concept of reasonableness. 
25Information must be disclosed only if it is reasonably related both to the powers or duties 
26of the person making the disclosure and to the powers or duties of the person receiving 
27the disclosure. The information must be reasonably related to the powers or duties of the 
28person making the disclosure, because otherwise that person cannot be expected to 
29possess the information. The information must also be reasonably related to the powers or 
30duties of the person receiving the disclosure, because otherwise that person would not 
31need the information. Examples of matters that might require disclosure under this 
32section include asset valuations, modifications to the terms of a trust, changes to 
33investment policy or strategy, distributions, changes in accounting procedure or 
34valuations, and removal or appointment of trustees and trust directors.
35Both an affirmative and a responsive duty to inform. This section imposes an 
36affirmative duty to provide information (even in the absence of a request for that 
37information) as well as a responsive duty to reply to requests for information. For 
38example, if a trust director exercises a power to modify the terms of a trust, the director 
39would have an affirmative duty to inform the trustees and other trust directors whose 
40powers or duties are reasonably related to the amendment whether or not the trustees or 
41other trust directors inquired about it. Similarly, the director would have a responsive 
42duty to provide information about the amendment upon a request by a trustee or another 
Page 27 - 129LR0511(01)-11trust director whose powers or duties were reasonably related to the amendment.
2Interaction with Section 11. The duties of a trustee (in subsection (a)) and of a 
3trust director (in subsection (b)) to disclose information are subject to the limitations of 
4Section 11. Thus, although a trustee has a duty under this section to disclose information 
5that is related to both the powers or duties of the trustee and the powers or duties of the 
6director, a trustee does not have a duty to inform or give advice to the trust director 
7concerning instances in which the trustee would have exercised the director's powers 
8differently. The same is true for a trust director.
9Shelton v. Tamposi. In Shelton v. Tamposi, 62 A.3d 741 (N.H. 2013), the terms 
10of the trust left distribution in the hands of the trustee, but shifted power over investment 
11to a trust director (the "investment director"). As a result, the trustee could not liquidate 
12investments to raise the cash necessary to fund a distribution to one of the beneficiaries. 
13Under subsection (b), the trust director would have been under a duty to give the trustee 
14information about the effects of the director's investment program on the trust's cash 
15position, and the trustee would have been under a duty to give the director information 
16about the cash requirements of the trustee's distribution program. Moreover, in making 
17and implementing the investment program, under Section 8(a) the trust director would be 
18subject to the same duties as a similarly situated trustee, just as the trustee would be 
19subject to the duties of a trustee in making and implementing the distribution program.   
20Subsections (c) and (d)—Subsection (c) provides a safe harbor for a trustee that 
21acts in reliance on information provided by a trust director. Subsection (d) provides a 
22similar safe harbor for a trust director for information provided by a trustee or other trust 
23director. Under both subsections, the safe harbor only applies if the trustee or trust 
24director that acts in reliance on the information is not engaged in willful misconduct. For 
25example, subsection (c) protects a trustee if the trustee acts in reliance on a trust director's 
26valuation of an asset, unless by accepting the valuation the trustee would engage in 
27willful misconduct. As in Section 9, the rationale for the safe harbor and willful 
28misconduct limit is to implement the settlor's division of labor subject to a mandatory 
29fiduciary minimum.
30No ceiling on duties to share information. This section imposes a mandatory 
31floor, rather than a ceiling, on a directed trustee's and a trust director's duty to share 
32information. The terms of a trust may specify more extensive duties of information 
33sharing among directed trustees and trust directors.
34§2111.  No duty to monitor, inform or advise
351.  Trustee.  Unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise:
36A.  A trustee does not have a duty to:
37(1)  Monitor a trust director; or
38(2)  Inform or give advice to a settlor, beneficiary, trustee or trust director 
39concerning an instance in which the trustee might have acted differently than the 
40director; and
Page 28 - 129LR0511(01)-11B.  By taking an action described in paragraph A, a trustee does not assume the duty 
2excluded by paragraph A.
32.  Trust director.  Unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise:
4A.  A trust director does not have a duty to:
5(1)  Monitor a trustee or another trust director; or
6(2)  Inform or give advice to a settlor, beneficiary, trustee or another trust director 
7concerning an instance in which the director might have acted differently than a 
8trustee or another trust director; and
9B.  By taking an action described in paragraph A, a trust director does not assume the 
10duty excluded by paragraph A.
11Comment
12(This is Section 11 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
13Following existing statutes. Subsection (a) provides that a trustee does not have a 
14duty to monitor a trust director or inform or give advice to a settlor, beneficiary, trustee, 
15or trust director concerning instances in which the trustee might have acted differently 
16than the director. Many existing state statutes are to similar effect, though the language in 
17this section is simpler and more direct. Subsection (b) applies the same rule to a trust 
18director regarding the actions of a trustee or another trust director. 
19The existing statutes on which this section is based were meant to reverse the 
20result in Rollins v. Branch Banking & Trust Company of Virginia, 56 Va. Cir. 147 
21(2002), in which the court considered the liability of a trustee that was subject to direction 
22in investment. The court declined to hold the trustee liable for the investment director's 
23failure to direct diversification of the trust's investments, but the court nevertheless held 
24the trustee liable for failing to advise the beneficiaries about the risks of the investment 
25director's actions.
26Survival of trustee's and trust director's general duty of disclosure. Although this 
27section confirms that a directed trustee has no duty to monitor a trust director or inform or 
28give advice to others concerning instances in which the trustee might have acted 
29differently than the director, this section does not relieve a trustee of its ordinary duties to 
30disclose, report, or account under otherwise applicable law such as under Uniform Trust 
31Code § 813 (2004) or Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 82 (2007). The same is true for a 
32trust director, on whom Section 8(a) imposes the fiduciary duties of a trustee.
33For example, if a trust director has a power to direct investments, this section 
34would relieve a directed trustee of any duty to advise a beneficiary about the risks of the 
35director's decision to concentrate the investment portfolio. The trustee would remain 
36under a duty, however, to make periodic reports or accountings to the beneficiary and to 
37answer reasonable inquiries by the beneficiary about the administration of the trust to the 
38extent required by otherwise applicable law. The trustee would also remain under the 
39duty imposed by Section 10 to provide a trust director with information reasonably 
40related to its powers and duties.
Page 29 - 129LR0511(01)-11No assumption of duty. In addition to waiving a directed trustee's duty to monitor, 
2inform, or give advice as under subsection (a)(1), many state statutes go further and also 
3provide that if a trustee for some reason chooses to monitor, inform, or give advice, these 
4activities will be deemed to be "administrative actions." See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, 
5§ 3313(e) (2017). The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that if a directed trustee 
6chooses for some reason to monitor, inform, or give advice, the trustee does not assume a 
7continuing obligation to do so or concede a prior duty to have done so. This section 
8dispenses with the opacity of an administrative classification and achieves the intended 
9result more directly. Subsection (a)(2) provides that if a trustee monitors, informs, or 
10gives advice about the actions of a trust director, the trustee does not thereby assume a 
11duty to do so. Subsection (b)(2) applies the same rule for a trust director.
12§2112.  Application to cotrustee
13The terms of a trust may relieve a cotrustee from duty and liability with respect to 
14another cotrustee's exercise or nonexercise of a power of the other cotrustee to the same 
15extent that in a directed trust a directed trustee is relieved from duty and liability with 
16respect to a trust director's power of direction under sections 2109 to 2111.
17Comment
18(This is Section 12 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
19Traditional law. Under traditional law, each cotrustee "has a duty to use 
20reasonable care to prevent a cotrustee from committing a breach of trust and, if a breach 
21of trust occurs, to obtain redress." Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 81(2) (2007). This rule 
22applies even if the settlor limits the role or function of one of the cotrustees. "Even in 
23matters for which a trustee is relieved of responsibility, … if the trustee knows that a co-
24trustee is committing or attempting to commit a breach of trust, the trustee has a duty to 
25take reasonable steps to prevent the fiduciary misconduct." Id. cmt. b. Moreover, "even in 
26the absence of any duty to intervene or grounds for suspicion, a trustee is entitled to 
27request and receive reasonable information regarding an aspect of trust administration in 
28which the trustee is not required to participate." Id. These rules for cotrusteeship contrast 
29with the less demanding fiduciary standards for a directed trusteeship under Sections 9, 
3010, and 11 of this act. 
31Settlor autonomy. This section allows a settlor to choose either fiduciary regime 
32for a cotrusteeship—the traditional rules of cotrusteeship or the more permissive rules of 
33a directed trusteeship. There seems little reason to prohibit a settlor from applying the 
34fiduciary rules of this act to a cotrusteeship given that the settlor could choose the more 
35permissive rules of a directed trusteeship by labeling one of the cotrustees as a trust 
36director and another as a directed trustee. The rationale for permitting the terms of a trust 
37to reduce the duty of a cotrustee that is subject to direction by another trustee is the same 
38as the rationale for permitting the terms of a trust to reduce the duty of a directed trustee. 
39In both instances, a trustee must act according to directions from another person and 
40therefore the other person, not the trustee, should bear the full fiduciary responsibility for 
41the action.
42Accordingly, if the terms of a trust so provide, a cotrustee may have only the duty 
Page 30 - 129LR0511(01)-11required by the reasonable action and willful misconduct standards specified in Section 9, 
2and be subject to the narrower rules governing information sharing and monitoring 
3specified in Sections 10 and 11, with respect to another cotrustee's exercise or 
4nonexercise of a power of that other cotrustee. If the terms of a trust indicate that a 
5directed cotrustee is to have no duty or is not a fiduciary, then the effect will be to reduce 
6the cotrustee's duties to those prescribed by Sections 9 through 11, just as would be the 
7effect of similar language for a directed trustee. 
8Mechanics of choosing directed trustee duties. Under this section the default rule 
9is that, if a settlor names cotrustees, the traditional law of cotrusteeship applies. The 
10fiduciary duties of directed trusteeship will only apply to a cotrustee if the terms of the 
11trust manifest such an intent.  Whether this section applies to a given trust is thus a 
12question of construction. This section does not impose a requirement of express reference 
13to this section or to this act. Moreover, under Section 3(a), this section applies to a trust 
14created before the effective date of this act, but only as to a decision or action on or after 
15that date.
16For example, a familiar drafting strategy is to name cotrustees but also to provide 
17that in the event of disagreement about a particular matter the decision of a specified 
18trustee controls and the other cotrustee has no liability in that event. Under traditional 
19law, notwithstanding this provision, the other cotrustee would be liable if it did not take 
20reasonable steps to prevent a breach by the controlling cotrustee. Under this section, on a 
21prospective basis the other cotrustee would be liable only for its own willful misconduct 
22akin to a directed trustee. 
23Cotrustees as directed trustees and trust directors. The terms of a trust can place 
24a cotrustee in a position of either giving direction, like a trust director, or taking direction, 
25like a directed trustee. This section only applies to a cotrustee that takes direction. This 
26section does not address the duties of a cotrustee that is not directed. Nor does this section 
27address the duties of a cotrustee that gives direction. Under Section 8, the background law 
28of an enacting state that applies to a directing cotrustee also applies to a similarly situated 
29trustee. The drafting committee intended that the language "with respect to another 
30cotrustee's exercise or nonexercise of a power of the other cotrustee" would refer only to 
31a power of another cotrustee and not a power held jointly with the directed cotrustee, 
32because a cotrustee cannot be thought of as taking direction from another cotrustee if the 
33two cotrustees exercise a power jointly.
34No third-party effects. Although this section changes the degree to which the 
35terms of a trust may reduce a cotrustee's duty and liability, it does not alter the rules that 
36affect the rights of third parties who contract with or otherwise interact with a cotrustee. 
37The principal difference between cotrusteeship and directed trusteeship is that in a 
38cotrusteeship every cotrustee has title to the trust property, whereas in a directed 
39trusteeship, title to trust property belongs only to the trustee, and not to the trust director. 
40The placement of title can have important consequences for dealings with third parties 
41and for tax, property, and other bodies of law outside of trust law. This section does not 
42change the rights of third parties who deal with a cotrustee in the cotrustee's capacity as 
43such. 
Page 31 - 129LR0511(01)-112113.  Limitation of action against trust director
21.  Action for breach of trust.  An action against a trust director for breach of trust 
3must be commenced within the same limitation period as in the Maine Uniform Trust 
4Code, section 1005 for an action for breach of trust against a trustee in a like position and 
5under similar circumstances.
62.  Report or accounting.  A report or accounting has the same effect on the 
7limitation period for an action against a trust director for breach of trust that the report or 
8accounting would have under the Maine Uniform Trust Code, section 1005 in an action 
9for breach of trust against a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances.
10Comment
11(This is Section 13 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
12This section absorbs for a trust director the law of an enacting state governing 
13limitations on an action against a trustee. A limitation applies to a trust director as it 
14would to a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances. Whether the law is 
15default or mandatory as applied to a trust director, for example, is determined by whether 
16it is default or mandatory as applied to a trustee.
17Subsection (a) extends to a trust director the same limits on liability that a trustee 
18enjoys under the law of an enacting state by way of a statutory limitations period, such as 
19under Uniform Trust Code § 1005(c) (2000). The limitations period absorbed by 
20subsection (a) applies to all claims against a trust director for breach of trust, whether by 
21a beneficiary, a trustee, another trust director, or some other party.
22Subsection (b) extends to a trust director the same limitation period that a trustee 
23enjoys under the law of an enacting state arising from the making of a report or 
24accounting, such as under Uniform Trust Code § 1005(a)–(b) (2000). The rule of 
25subsection (b) applies regardless of whether the report or accounting was made by the 
26trust director. A trust director may therefore be protected by a report or accounting made 
27by a trustee or another trust director even though the director did not make the report or 
28accounting, so long as the report or accounting fairly discloses the relevant facts of the 
29director's conduct.
30Laches, which strictly speaking is an equitable defense rather than a limitations 
31period, would apply to an action against a trust director under Section 14.
32§2114.  Defenses in action against trust director
33In an action against a trust director for breach of trust, the director may assert the 
34same defenses a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances could assert in 
35an action for breach of trust against the trustee.
36Comment
37(This is Section 14 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
Page 32 - 129LR0511(01)-11Absorption. This section makes available to a trust director the same defenses 
2that are available to a trustee in a like position and under similar circumstances in an 
3action for breach of trust. A trust director can assert any defense that would be available 
4to a trustee in a comparable action for breach of trust under existing state law, including: 
5laches or estoppel (see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 98 (2012));
6consent, release, or ratification by a beneficiary (see Uniform Trust Code § 1009 
7(2001); Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 97(b)–(c) (2012));
8reasonable reliance on the terms of a trust (see Uniform Trust Code § 1006 
9(2000); Uniform Prudent Investor Act § 1(b) (1994)); and
10reasonable care in ascertaining the happening of an event affecting administration 
11or distribution (see Uniform Trust Code § 1007 (2000); Restatement (Third) of 
12Trusts § 76 cmt. f (2007)).
13Exculpation or exoneration. The comments to Section 8 address the effect of an 
14exculpation or exoneration clause on the duty and liability of a trust director.  
15Attorney's fees and indemnification. Attorney's fees and indemnification for a 
16trust director are governed by Section 6(b)(1), which establishes a default rule that allows 
17a trust director to exercise "any further power appropriate to the exercise or nonexercise 
18of a power of direction granted to the director." By default, therefore, a trust director has 
19a power to incur attorney's fees and other expenses and to direct indemnification for them 
20if doing so would be "appropriate" to the exercise of the director's express powers.  
21§2115.  Jurisdiction over trust director
221.  Personal jurisdiction.  By accepting appointment as a trust director of a trust 
23subject to this Act, the director submits to personal jurisdiction of the courts of this State 
24regarding any matter related to a power or duty of the director.
252.  Other methods not excluded.  This section does not preclude other methods of 
26obtaining jurisdiction over a trust director.
27Comment
28(This is Section 15 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
29Under subsection (a), by accepting appointment as a trust director of a trust 
30subject to this act, the director submits to personal jurisdiction of the courts of this state 
31with respect to "any matter related to a power or duty of the director." This subsection 
32does not apply to a person that has not accepted appointment as a trust director (the 
33question of whether a person has accepted appointment is governed by Section 16(1)). 
34The drafting committee contemplated that a purported director could contest acceptance, 
35and therefore jurisdiction, in the normal course of a judicial proceeding in which the 
36matter arose, as under Fed. R. Civ. P. § 12(b)(2).  
37Jurisdiction over a person that has accepted appointment as trust director is 
Page 33 - 129LR0511(01)-11mandatory. The terms of a trust or an agreement among the trust director and other parties 
2cannot negate personal jurisdiction over a trust director under this section. However, this 
3section does not preclude a court from declining to exercise jurisdiction under the 
4doctrine of forum non conveniens. 
5Subsection (b) confirms that subsection (a) does not prescribe the exclusive 
6method of obtaining jurisdiction over a trust director.
7§2116.  Office of trust director
8Unless the terms of a trust provide otherwise, the rules applicable to a trustee apply to 
9a trust director regarding the following matters:
101.  Acceptance.  Acceptance under the Maine Uniform Trust Code, section 701;
112.  Bond to secure performance.  Giving of bond to secure performance under the 
12Maine Uniform Trust Code, section 702;
133.  Reasonable compensation.  Reasonable compensation under the Maine Uniform 
14Trust Code, section 708;
154.  Resignation.  Resignation under the Maine Uniform Trust Code, section 705;
165.  Removal.  Removal under the Maine Uniform Trust Code, section 706; and
176.  Successor.  Vacancy and appointment of successor under the Maine Uniform 
18Trust Code, section 704.
19Comment
20(This is Section 16 of the Uniform Directed Trust Act (2017).)
21This section applies the law of trusteeship to a trust directorship with regard to 
22seven subjects. Whether the law is default or mandatory as applied to a trust director 
23depends on whether it is default or mandatory as applied to a trustee.
24Paragraph (1)—acceptance. This paragraph absorbs an enacting state's law 
25governing acceptance of a trusteeship, such as under Uniform Trust Code § 701(a)–(b) 
26(2000) or Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 35 (2003), for application to acceptance of a 
27trust directorship. However, whereas a trustee is expected to participate actively in the 
28administration of the trust, and is therefore usually capable of signaling acceptance by 
29conduct, some trust directors, such as a director with a power to determine the settlor's 
30competence, may not take any action for long stretches of time, if ever. This delay in 
31action may complicate acceptance by conduct.
32Paragraph (2)—bond. This paragraph absorbs an enacting state's law governing 
33bond to secure performance by a trustee, such as under Uniform Trust Code § 702(a)–(b) 
34(2000) and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 34(3) (2003), for application to bond by a 
35trust director. The drafting committee assumed that bond would seldom be required for a 
36trust director, as in the usual case the director would not have custody of the trust 
Page 34 - 129LR0511(01)-11property. 
2Paragraph (3)—reasonable compensation. This paragraph absorbs an enacting 
3state's law governing reasonable compensation of a trustee, such as under Uniform Trust 
4Code § 708 (2000) and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. i (2003), for application 
5to compensation of a trust director. The drafting committee contemplated that, just as in 
6total "the reasonable fees for multiple trustees may be higher than for a single trustee," 
7Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. i (2003), so too the total reasonable fees for a 
8trust with a directed trustee and a trust director may be higher than for a single trustee. 
9Reasonable compensation for a trust director will vary based on the nature of the 
10director's powers, and in some circumstances may well be zero. A state that provides a 
11statutory commission for a trustee should therefore refrain from using the commission for 
12a trust director and should instead use a rule of reasonable compensation. Statutory 
13trustee commissions will often overcompensate a trust director, especially a director that 
14does not participate actively on an ongoing basis in the administration of the trust. The 
15problem will be especially serious in a trust with multiple such directors.
16Moreover, the reasonable compensation of a directed trustee is likely to be less 
17than that for a trustee that is not directed. An apt analogy is to a trustee that hires others to 
18"render services expected or normally to be performed by the trustee." Restatement 
19(Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. c(1) (2003); see also Uniform Prudent Investor Act § 9 cmt. 
20(1994) ("If, for example, the trustee's regular compensation schedule presupposes that the 
21trustee will conduct the investment management function, it should ordinarily follow that 
22the trustee will lower its fee when delegating the investment function to an outside 
23manager."). 
24Paragraph (4)—resignation. This paragraph absorbs an enacting state's law 
25governing resignation by a trustee, such as under Uniform Trust Code § 705 (2001) and 
26Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 36 (2003), for application to resignation by a trust 
27director. 
28Paragraph (5)—removal. This subsection absorbs an enacting state's law 
29governing removal of a trustee, such as under Uniform Trust Code § 706 (2000) and 
30Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. e (2003), for application to removal of a trust 
31director.
32Paragraph (6)—vacancy. This section absorbs an enacting state's law applicable 
33to a vacancy in a trusteeship for application to a vacancy in a trust directorship. For 
34example, under Uniform Trust Code § 704 (2004), "a vacancy in a trusteeship need not be 
35filled" if "one or more cotrustees remain in office." So too, if three of five trust directors 
36with a joint power to determine the settlor's capacity remain in office, the court "need 
37not" fill the vacancies, though the vacancies should be filled if doing so would be more 
38consistent with the settlor's plan. Likewise, if the sole trust director with power over 
39investment of the trust property ceases to serve, in most circumstances the vacancy 
40should be filled, and this is true even if other directors with unrelated powers remain in 
41office. An apt analogy is to a trust with several cotrustees, each of whom has controlling 
42authority over different aspects of the trust's administration. If any of those trustees ceases 
43to serve, in many circumstances a court should appoint a successor even though other 
Page 35 - 129LR0511(01)-11cotrustees remain in office. 
2Costs and indemnification. The power of a trust director to incur reasonable costs 
3and to direct indemnification for expenses would in most cases be covered by Section 
46(b)(1). 
5§2117.  Uniformity of application and construction
6In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration must be given to the need 
7to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact 
8it.
9§2118.  Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act
10This Act modifies, limits and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global 
11and National Commerce Act, 15 United States Code, Section 7001 et seq., but does not 
12modify, limit or supersede Section 101(c) of that Act, 15 United States Code, Section 
137001(c), or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in Section 103(b) 
14of that Act, 15 United States Code, Section 7003(b).
15§2119.  Effective date
16This Act takes effect January 1, 2020.
17SUMMARY
18This bill enacts the Maine Uniform Directed Trust Act as approved by the Uniform 
19Law Commissioners in 2017.  It includes confirming amendments to the Uniform Trust 
20Code, adopted in this State as the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-B, Part 1, the Maine 
21Uniform Trust Code.
