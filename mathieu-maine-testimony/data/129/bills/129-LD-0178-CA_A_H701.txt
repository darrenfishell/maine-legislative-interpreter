The Retired Teachers Health Insurance program is currently budgeted to receive $45.0 million in General Fund 
appropriations in both fiscal year 2019-20 and fiscal year 2020-21. Based on 8 months of actual expendih1re data, it is 
estimated that the State will pay approximately $31.9 million for its contribution for retired teachers health insurance 
premiums in fiscal year 2019-20. The State is also expected to apply $10.0 million of the General Fund appropriation 
towards the unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) of the retired teachers health insurance plan pursuant to Title 5, §286-
B, sub-§2, Given this information, expenditures for this program are expected to be less than current appropriations 
for fiscal year 2019-20 by approximately $3.1 million ($45.0 million -$41.9 million), For fiscal year 2020-21, 
however, when the $3.4 million cost of this provision and the plan change together (g) is added to the projected 
expendihll'es of $32.3 million (a) along with another $10.0 million being applied to the UAL, expendihll'es are 
projected to exceed appropriations by approximately $0.676 million ($45.0 million -3.4 million -$32.3 million -
$10.0 million). Funds appropriated to the Retired Teachers Health Insurance program are transferred to the Retiree 
Health Insurance Fund, an internal services fund within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. 
Unexpended funds in this Fund are carried forward into the next fiscal year and may be used to pay future premium 
costs or applied to the nonnal or UAL costs of the retired teachers health insurance plan. It is the intent that a portion 
of the $3.1 million in anticipated unexpended funds in fiscal year 2019-20 be used to cover the $676,000 cost in fiscal 
year 2020-21 and no additional funding is required in fiscal year 2020-21.
