33 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, clarifies the process 
34 for the designation of caucus political action committees by specifying that each Senate 
35 caucus leader and each House caucus leader may designate one caucus political action 
36 committee to promote the election of nominees of the caucus leader's political party to the 
37 body of the Legislature of which that caucus leader is a member. Under the amendment, 
38 a caucus leader is a member of a political party in a body of the Legislature who has been 
39 elected the leader of that political party in that body of the Legislature. If the President of 
40 the Senate or the Speaker of the House is a member of a political party, the President of 
41 the Senate or Speaker of the House is the caucus leader of that political party in the 
42 respective body of the Legislature.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT . "to S.P. 654, L.D. 1902 
1 The amendment also makes technical changes to the law governing the appointment 
2 of members of the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices. 
3 Specifically, in the provisions outlining who has the authority to propose individuals for 
4 appointment to the commission, the phrases "appointed leader from each political party in 
5 the Senate" and "appointed leader from each political party in the House of 
6 Representatives" are replaced with the newly defined terms "Senate caucus leader" and 
7 "House caucus leader." 
8 The amendment further allows the unenrolled members of the Senate and the 
9 unenrolled members of the House of Representatives to elect a leader who may designate 
10 an unenrolled political action committee to promote the election ofunenrolled candidates 
11 to that body of the Legislature. Like a caucus political action committee, an unenrolled 
12 political action committee may make unlimited donations to a candidate to fund a 
13 recount. In addition, although Maine Clean Election Act candidates are generally 
14 prohibited from serving as the treasurer, principal officer, primary fund-raiser or primary 
15 decision maker for a political action committee, the amendment authorizes Maine Clean 
16 Election Act candidates to engage in fund-raising or decision making for an unenrolled 
17 political action committee to the same extent that Maine Clean Election Act candidates 
18 may engage in such activities for a caucus political action committee.
