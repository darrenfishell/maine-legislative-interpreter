Page 1 - 129LR2088(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §214, sub-§1, ¶F is enacted to read:
3F.  If an employee has demonstrated an inability to obtain suitable employment with 
4the previous employer due to the partial incapacity, a rebuttable presumption is 
5created that the employee is entitled to receive a weekly compensation amount under 
6section 213 that is equal to the amount permitted for total incapacity under section 
7212.
8The previous employer may rebut this presumption by providing evidence of the 
9availability of alternative employment in the employee's community that is within the 
10restrictions of the employee's partial incapacity.  The employee may overcome this 
11evidence of suitable alternative employment in the employee's community by 
12demonstrating a lack of employment despite the employee's reasonable efforts to 
13secure employment based on the evidence submitted by the previous employer of 
14available suitable alternative employment in the employee's community.
15SUMMARY
16Under current law, an injured worker who is only partially incapacitated by a 
17workplace injury may be eligible for so-called 100% partial incapacity benefits if the 
18worker is not working, as long as the worker can demonstrate that the lack of 
19employment is due to the injury and that the worker has not been able to obtain 
20employment, within the restrictions caused by the partial incapacity, despite an adequate 
21work search.  The Maine Supreme Judicial Court outlined the factors that must be 
22considered when determining whether a work search by the injured worker is sufficient in 
23the case Monaghan v. Jordan's Meats, 2007 ME 100, 928 A.2d 786.
24This bill abrogates the current "work search rule" by placing the burden on the 
25previous employer to demonstrate that there is suitable employment available to the 
26injured worker in the worker's local community.  If the previous employer has 
27demonstrated suitable available employment, the injured worker may still be eligible for 
28so-called 100% partial incapacity benefits if the worker can demonstrate continued 
29unemployment despite reasonable efforts to secure the alternative employment identified 
30by the previous employer.
