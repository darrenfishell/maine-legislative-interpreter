Page 1 - 129LR1885(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  18-C MRSA ยง2-807, sub-ยง2, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, ยง2 
3and affected by Pt. F, ยง1, is amended to read:
42.  Wrongful death action; damages; limitation.  Every wrongful death action must 
5be brought by and in the name of the personal representative or special administrator of 
6the deceased person, and is distributable, after payment for funeral expenses and the costs 
7of recovery including attorney's fees, directly to the decedent's heirs without becoming 
8part of the probate estate, except as may be specifically provided in this subsection.  The 
9amount recovered in every wrongful death action, except as specifically provided in this 
10subsection, is for the exclusive benefit of the deceased's heirs to be distributed to the 
11individuals and in the proportions as provided in sections 2-102 and 2-103.  The jury may 
12give damages as it determines a fair and just compensation for the probable duration of 
13life of the deceased person but for the injury, and with reference to the pecuniary injuries 
14resulting from the death.  Damages are payable to the estate of the deceased person only 
15if the jury specifically makes an award payable to the estate for reasonable expenses of 
16medical, surgical and hospital care and treatment and for reasonable funeral expenses or, 
17in the case of a settlement, the settlement documents specifically provide for such an 
18allocation to the estate for the same.  In addition, the jury may give damages not 
19exceeding $500,000 $1,000,000 for the loss of comfort, society and companionship of the 
20deceased, including any damages for emotional distress arising from the same facts as 
21those constituting the underlying claim, to the persons for whose benefit the action is 
22brought.  The jury may also give punitive damages not exceeding $250,000.  An action 
23under this section must be commenced within 2 years after the decedent's death, except 
24that if the decedent's death is caused by a homicide, the action may be commenced within 
256 years of the date the personal representative or special administrator of the decedent 
26discovers that there is a just cause of action against the person who caused the homicide.  
27If a claim under this section is settled without an action having been commenced, the 
28amount paid in settlement must be distributed as provided in this subsection.  A 
29settlement on behalf of minor children is not valid unless approved by the court, as 
30provided in Title 14, section 1605.
31SUMMARY
32This bill provides that a jury in a case of wrongful death may give damages as it 
33determines a fair and just compensation for the probable duration of life of the deceased 
34person but for the injury.  It increases the limit on damages for the loss of comfort, 
35society and companionship and emotional distress from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and 
36removes the limit on punitive damages in a case of wrongful death.
