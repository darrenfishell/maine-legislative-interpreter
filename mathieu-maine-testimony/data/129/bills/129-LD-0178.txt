9SUMMARY
10Current law requires the State to pay 45% of a retired teacher's share of the premium 
11for group accident and sickness or health insurance.  This bill raises that percentage to 
1250% from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020; 55% from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021; 60% 
13from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022; 65% from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023; 70% from 
14July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024; 75% from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025; 80% from July 1, 
152025 to June 30, 2026; 85% from July 1, 2026 to June 30, 2027; and 90% after June 30, 
162027.  It also removes some outdated language and the cap on the increase in the State's 
17total cost for retired teachers' health insurance premiums for fiscal years ending after June 
1830, 2015.
