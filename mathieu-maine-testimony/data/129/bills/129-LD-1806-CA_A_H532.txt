Fiscal Note 
Reduction in tuition revenue -Higher educational institutions 
Expanding the tuition waiver for the child of a veteran who is attending state-supported postsecondary institutions to 
include a certificate program and master's degree programs will result in a reduction in tuition revenue to the state 
supported higher educational institutions. The amount of tuition loss can not be determined at this time. However, a. 
estimate provided by the University of Maine System anticipates revenue loss of approximately $350,000 per year. 
The system has indicated that unless General Fund appropriations are provided to offset the revenue loss, programs 
and services offered by the university may be impacted.
