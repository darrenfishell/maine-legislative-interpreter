An Act To Require Public School Buses To Be Equipped with School Bus Crossing Arms 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment ,A,(/1-/C/l>) 
Committee: Transportation 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential future biennium cost increase -Local school administrative units 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Requiring all school buses with a model year of 2021 or newer be equipped with a school bus crossing ann may result 
in future increased costs to local school administrative units (SAU's) that pm-chase the newer model buses and to the 
State for increased subsidy amounts paid to local SAU's approved to purchase a bus through the School Bus Purohase 
Program. 
According to the Department of Education, purchasing a school bus with a school bus crossing am1 may increase the 
total cost of a school bus by as much as $700 per bus. SAU's that are approved to purchase a new school bus through 
the School Bus Purchase Program receive funding from the State ,as part of their total subsidy to partially offset the 
cost of the new bus. The amount of subsidy is a set amount that is detennined by the Office of Procurement Services 
within the Department of Administrative and Financial Senrices and is based on bids from vendors that meet the 
minimum state specifications for school buses. This fiscal note assumes that the additional cost of crossing anns will 
be added to the subsidy amounts provided by the State. Those local SAU's that purchase buses outside of the School 
Bus Purchase Program will be responsible for 100% of the additional cost.
