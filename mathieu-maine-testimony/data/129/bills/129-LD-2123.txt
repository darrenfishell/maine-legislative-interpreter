5paper manufacturing facilities, particularly those facilities located in areas of high

7paper industry.  The Legislature further finds that investments in machines used for the 
8production of paper products in Maine will create new jobs, retain current jobs, benefit 
9small businesses that supply goods and services to paper manufacturing facilities, 
10increase the tax base and provide many other direct and indirect economic benefits to the 
11State.
