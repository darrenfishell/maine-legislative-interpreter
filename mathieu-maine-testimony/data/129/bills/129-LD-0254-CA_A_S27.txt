Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would exempt Maine manufacturers from a requirement to register the labels of all malt liquor, wine, hard 
cider and low-alcohol spirits with the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) within the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services if these products are given or sold as samples by the 
manufacturer for on-premises consumption only. The changes to labeling requirements will reduce the number of 
labels registered and will result in a minor General Fund revenue decrease for BABLO.
