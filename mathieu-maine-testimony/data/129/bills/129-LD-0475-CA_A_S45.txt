1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. It provides that, instead of requiring that the 
3 custodian of the recording of an E-9-1-1 call give a copy of the recording to the person 
4 who made the call as provided in the bill, a party to a protection from harassment or 
5 protection from abuse action to which the E-9-1-1 call is relevant may request that the 
6 recording be sent to the clerk's office of the court in which the action is pending. The 
7 court may then review the recording and determine whether the parties or their attorneys, 
8 if the parties are represented, should have access to or, for good cause shown, a copy of 
9 the recording. 
10 When requesting a recording be sent to the clerk, the party making the request to the 
11 custodian is required to provide the names of the parties, the court that is presiding over 
12 the action and the docket number. The request must be made in writing, which may 
13 include e-mail. The request must be made so as to allow the custodian a reasonable 
14 amount of time to search for, retrieve and send the recording. The custodian must send 
15 the recording in the format that both the custodian and the courts use.
