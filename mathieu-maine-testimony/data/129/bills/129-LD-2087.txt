19 B.  The employer is subject to an obligation imposed by any federal or state law or

27 D.  The employer participates in a program that encourages employment of persons 
28 with criminal convictions.
29 4. Waiver.  An employer may inquire about criminal convictions on an initial
30 employee application form pursuant to subsection 3 even if the federal or state law or 
31 regulation or rule creating an obligation for the employer not to employ a person who has 
32 been convicted of one or more types of criminal offenses also permits the employer to 
33 obtain a waiver that would allow the employer to employ such a person.

4 assertion is limited to the types of criminal offenses creating the disqualification;
5 B.  The employer is subject to an obligation imposed by any federal or state law or 
6 regulation or rule not to employ a person, in either one or more positions, who has

9 C.  The employer is required by federal or state law or regulation or rule to conduct a 
10 criminal history record check for the position for which the prospective employee is

14 position under applicable federal or state law or regulation or rule, must be afforded an 
15 opportunity to explain the information and the circumstances regarding any convictions, 
16 including post-conviction rehabilitation.
17 8. Penalty.  This section may be enforced pursuant to section 626-A.  The civil
18 action provided pursuant to section 626-A may be brought to enforce this section by or on 
19 behalf of a person affected by a violation of this section or by the Department of Labor on

21 investigate and bring an enforcement action relating to a complaint of employment

34 application form or advertisement or otherwise asserting that a person with a criminal
