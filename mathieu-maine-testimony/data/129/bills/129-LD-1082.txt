24SUMMARY
25This bill prohibits an individual licensed to prescribe opioid medication from 
26prescribing opioid medication to a patient who does not have an active prescription for 
27opioid medication unless the patient has completed 24 sessions of alternative pain 
28treatment.  This bill exempts from this requirement patients who have pain associated 
29with cancer treatment, palliative care in conjunction with a serious illness, end-of-life and 
30hospice care, medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder and other 
31circumstances determined in rule by the Department of Health and Human Services. This 
32bill requires an individual licensed to prescribe opioid medication to discuss alternative 
33pain treatment with a patient who has an active prescription for opioid medication. This 
34bill also provides that a referral from an individual licensed under the Maine Revised 
35Statutes, Title 32 whose scope of practice includes prescribing opioid medication is not 
36required for coverage for alternative pain treatment and that the cost of covered 
37alternative pain treatment may not exceed the cost of a visit to a primary care provider.
