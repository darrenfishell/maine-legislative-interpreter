17 SUMMARY 
18 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. Like the bill, the amendment removes 
19 the requirement in current law that beano or bingo games conducted by an organization 
20 such as a volunteer fire department, agricultural fair association or nonprofit association 
21 must be conducted entirely by members of the organization. Under the amendment, the 
22 beano or bingo games must be conducted under the exclusive control of an adult member 
23 of the organization, who may be assisted by other individuals. The amendment defines 
24 "member" to mean an individual duly admitted as a member according to the laws, rules, 
25 regulations, ordinances or bylaws governing the organization. 
26 The amendment also makes a technical change to the laws governing beano and 
27 bingo to clarify that a charitable, educational, political, civic, recreational, fraternal, 
28 patriotic, religious or veterans' organization that seeks to obtain a registration to conduct 
29 beano or bingo must be a bona fide nonprofit organization.
