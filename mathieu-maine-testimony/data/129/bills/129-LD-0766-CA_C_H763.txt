SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
It replaces the bill but carries out the bill's intent of extending tribal court jurisdiction, 
originally authorized by the federal Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 
2013, to any person who commits certain Class D domestic violence offenses against a 
member of a federally recognized tribe, nation, band or other group on the lands of the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation. This concurrent jurisdiction includes 
offenses committed by a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe, nation, band or 
other group on tribal lands against a person who is not a member of any federally 
recognized Indian tribe, nation, band or other group. 
Parts A and C apply to the Penobscot Nation. Parts B and D apply to the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe. 
This amendment provides authority for the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot 
Nation to extend the jurisdiction of their respective tribal courts over certain criminal 
offenses committed by a person, regardless of whether the person is a member of a 
federally recognized Indian tribe. The criminal offenses are domestic violence offenses 
in the Maine Criminal Code and criminal violation of a protection from abuse order, but 
do not include offenses between nontribal members. The criminal offenses are Class D 
crimes, and the tribe's and nation's jurisdictions are concurrent with the State's jurisdiction 
for the crimes. The amendment references the tribal courts' guarantees of all other rights 
whose protection is necessary under the United States Constitution in order for the State 
to authorize concurrent jurisdiction to ensure that this enactment, if ratified by the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, or both, is not later determined or deemed 
to be unconstitutional based on subsequent judicial decisions. This extended jurisdiction 
applies to the domestic violence crimes committed on the respective reservations and 
lands taken into trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of the

20 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "c" to H.P. 571, L.D. 766 
Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, now or in the future. This extended 
jurisdiction covers lands held in trust on or before the effective date of this Act, as well as 
lands taken into trust after the effective date of this Act. 
This amendment also extends the exclusive jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy Tribal 
Court to criminal offenses committed on the Passamaquoddy Indian Reservation between 
members of any federally recognized Indian tribe, nation, band or other group. 
The tribal courts, law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers are 
required to participate in uniform crime reporting by reporting certain information to the 
Department of Public Safety, State Bureau of Identification, and the bureau is required to 
share its annual reports with tribal law enforcement agencies. 
Other changes include revisions to the definition of "another jurisdiction" in the 
Maine Criminal Code to include criminal convictions by courts of federally recognized 
Indian tribes, This change is consistent with federal law and the recognition of orders of 
protection from abuse from the courts of federally recognized Indian tribes by the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, section 4011. 
The changes to the Act To Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement included 
in this amendment do not take effect unless the tribes affected approve of the changes and 
certify their approval.
