This bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $17, 726,496 
beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 for an 8% increase to rates for Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter 
III, Section 65, Behavioral Health Services. 
The rate increase in this bill is paid with state General Fund money only, since PL 2017 c. 460 increased rates for 
services in Sections 17, 23 and 65 which are included in the Clinic Upper Payment Limit calculations. The impact of 
those increases put the depmiment at or slightly above the amount allowed to be paid by the federal Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services.
