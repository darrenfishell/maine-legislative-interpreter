Fiscal Detail and Notes 
According to information provided by the Maine Community College System (MCCS), this legislation may result in 
increased security and maintenance costs of approximately $31,500 per year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20. This 
estimate assumes that one event per month will occur at each of the 7 campuses within the MCCS for the 9 months 
that the college is in session at a cost of $500 per event. The actual cost to the MCCS will depend on actual 
experience. 
Additional costs to the University of Maine System and Maine Maritime Academy to implement the requirements of 
this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
