4the children's diet and nutrition beginning at a very young age; and
5Whereas, many families in the State do not have the income or the means to access 
6adequate nutrition and a healthy diet; and
7Whereas, many children who do not receive adequate nutrition at home receive 
8nutritious food at school through various school food service programs; and
9Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90-day 
10period in order for schoolchildren in the State to benefit from the federal child and adult 
11care food program for the 2019-2020 school year; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15therefore,
