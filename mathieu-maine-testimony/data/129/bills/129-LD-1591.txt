Page 1 - 129LR1546(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1722, sub-§1, ¶¶A and B, as reallocated by RR 2007, c. 2, 
3§9, are amended to read:
4A.  Each hospital may voluntarily hold its consolidated operating margin to no more 
5than 3%.  For purposes of this paragraph, a hospital's consolidated operating margin 
6is calculated by dividing its consolidated operating income by its total consolidated 
7operating revenue.  Annually, for each hospital, the department shall establish a 
8recommended percentage that the hospital should hold its consolidated operating 
9margin to and notify a hospital of the department's recommendation for that hospital.
10B.  Each hospital may voluntarily restrain its increase in its expense per 
11casemix-adjusted inpatient and volume-adjusted outpatient discharge to no more than 
12110% of the forecasted increase in the hospital market basket index for the coming 
13federal fiscal year, as published in the Federal Register, when the federal Centers for 
14Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes the Medicare program's hospital inpatient 
15prospective payment system rates for the coming federal fiscal year.  For purposes of 
16this paragraph, the measure of a hospital's expense per casemix-adjusted inpatient and 
17volume-adjusted outpatient discharge is calculated by:
18(1)  Calculating the hospital's total hospital-only expenses;
19(2)  Subtracting from the hospital's total hospital-only expenses the amount of the 
20hospital's bad debt;
21(3)  Subtracting from the amount reached in subparagraph (2) the hospital taxes 
22paid to the State during the hospital's fiscal year; and
23(4)  Dividing the amount reached in subparagraph (3) by the product of:
24(a)  The number of inpatient discharges, adjusted by the all payer case mix 
25index for the hospital; and
26(b)  The ratio of total gross patient service revenue to gross inpatient service 
27revenue.
28For the purposes of this paragraph, a hospital's total hospital-only expenses include 
29any item that is listed on the hospital's Medicare cost report as a subprovider, such as 
30a psychiatric unit or rehabilitation unit, and does not include nonhospital cost centers 
31shown on the hospital's Medicare cost report, such as home health agencies, nursing 
32facilities, swing beds, skilled nursing facilities and hospital-owned physician 
33practices.  For purposes of this paragraph, a hospital's bad debt is as defined and 
34reported in the hospital's Medicare cost report and as submitted to the Maine Health 
35Data Organization pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1683. Annually, for each hospital, the 
36department shall establish a recommended limit on an increase in the hospital's 
37expenses under this paragraph and notify the hospital of the department's 
38recommendation for that hospital.
39Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2892, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. IIII, §1, is further 
40amended by adding at the end a new paragraph to read:

2the hospital's fiscal year that ended during calendar year 2018.
3Sec. 3.  Medicare Buy-in Program and Affordable Care Act subsidies; 
4plan for increased funding.  The Department of Health and Human Services shall 
5develop a plan to provide increased funding for the Medicare Buy-in Program and for 
6subsidies to individuals under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
7using revenue resulting from changing, from 2014 to 2018, the base year on which the 
8hospital tax is imposed under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 2892.  By 
9December 4, 2019, the department shall submit a report on the plan to the Joint Standing 
10Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services and the committee may 
11report out a bill relating to the report to the Second Regular Session of the 129th 
12Legislature.
13Sec. 4.  Wholesale prescription drug importation program; design.  The 
14Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with relevant other state 
15agencies, federal agencies and interested parties, shall design a wholesale prescription 
16drug importation program that complies with 21 United States Code, Section 384, 
17including requirements regarding safety and cost savings.  By December 4, 2019, the 
18department shall submit the design for a wholesale prescription drug importation program 
19to the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
20and the committee may report out a bill to the Second Regular Session of the 129th

22department must ensure that the program:
231.  Designates a state agency to oversee the program and become a licensed 
24wholesaler for the purpose of seeking federal certification and approval to import safe 
25prescription drugs that will provide savings to consumers in the State;
262.  Uses Canadian suppliers of prescription drugs regulated under the appropriate 
27Canadian or provincial laws;
283.  Includes a process to sample the purity, chemical composition and potency of 
29imported prescription drugs;
304.  Ensures that only those prescription drugs expected to generate substantial savings 
31for consumers in the State are imported into the State;
325.  Ensures that imported prescription drugs will not be distributed, dispensed or sold 
33outside of the State;
346.  Ensures that consumers and health plans are charged only the actual acquisition 
35cost of the imported, dispensed prescription drugs;
367.  Ensures that the health plan payment of the prescription drug component of 
37pharmacy and health care provider billing reimburses no more than the actual acquisition 
38cost of the dispensed, imported prescription drug;
Page 3 - 129LR1546(01)-118.  Ensures that participating health plans keep their formularies and claims payment 
2systems up to date with the prescription drugs provided through the program;

4than the actual acquisition cost of the dispensed, imported prescription drug;

6to oversee the program how savings on imported drugs are reflected in premiums;
711.  Limits the profit margin of any participating wholesaler or distributor of

11United States patent laws on United States branded products;

13Code, Sections 360eee and 360eee-1 to the extent practical and feasible prior to imported 
14prescription drugs coming into the possession of the licensed wholesaler and that the 
15program complies fully with those federal requirements after imported prescription drugs 
16are in the possession of the licensed wholesaler;
1714.  Is adequately financed through a fee on each prescription or other appropriate 
18approach, as long as the fee does not jeopardize significant consumer savings; and

20SUMMARY
21This bill specifies that the base year for the hospital tax imposed under the Maine 
22Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 2892 is 2018.  It directs the Department of Health and 
23Human Services to submit a plan to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human 
24Services regarding how the additional state revenue resulting from that change can be 
25used for the Medicare Buy-in Program and for subsidies under the federal Patient 
26Protection and Affordable Care Act.
27Current law provides that each hospital may voluntarily hold its consolidated 
28operating margin to no more than 3% and its increase in its expense per casemix-adjusted 
29inpatient and volume-adjusted outpatient discharge to no more than 110% of the 
30forecasted increase in the hospital market basket index for the coming federal fiscal year.  
31The bill does not change those percentages but requires the Department of Health and 
32Human Services to annually establish recommended percentages for each hospital.
33The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with 
34relevant other state agencies, federal agencies and interested parties, to design a 
35wholesale prescription drug importation program.  It requires the department to submit 
36the design for the wholesale prescription drug importation program to the Joint Standing 
37Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services and authorizes the 
38committee to report out a bill to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.
