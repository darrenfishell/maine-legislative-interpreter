24subcontractors, meets the responsible contractor requirements of this subchapter, meets 
25the requirements of any other applicable laws and rules and possesses the resources, 
26qualifications and capabilities to successfully perform the contract.  As part of this 
27review, the bureau shall verify that the contractor responsibility certification form under 
28section 1826-Q has been submitted and properly executed for all contractors.  The bureau

37requirements of this section; require the prospective awardee to perform the work in 
38question if the prospective awardee has the required experience, licenses and other 
39qualifications to perform such work; or disqualify the prospective awardee. If the bureau

41prospective awardee may not make any contractual claim against the bureau on the basis 
42of a subcontractor disqualification.
435.  Written determination.  If, at the conclusion of the review required by 
44subsection 4, the bureau determines that all contractor responsibility certification forms 
Page 5 - 129LR0678(01)-11under section 1826-Q have been properly completed and executed and the qualifications, 
2background and responsibility of the prospective awardee and its subcontractors are 
3satisfactory, it shall issue a written determination verifying that the prospective awardee 
4is a qualified responsible contractor.  If the bureau determines that the prospective 
5awardee does not meet the requirements of this subchapter, the bureau shall advise the 
6prospective awardee of its determination in writing and proceed to consider the 2nd best-
7value bidder or, if necessary, rebid the project.  The determination of contractor 
8responsibility must be issued no less than 30 days after the date of the notice of intent to 
9award the contract.  The bureau may revoke or revise the determination of contractor 
10responsibility at any time if the bureau obtains relevant information warranting any such 
11revocation or revision.
12§1826-S.  False or misleading information
13If at any time the bureau determines that a contractor responsibility certification form 
14submitted pursuant to section 1826-Q contains false or misleading material information 
15provided by a contractor knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth or evidences 
16an omission of material information knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth by 
17the contractor, the bureau shall prohibit the contractor for which the certification form

24until all requirements of this subchapter are met by the contractor.
25§1826-U.  Relationship to other requirements
26The requirements of this subchapter are intended to supplement, but not replace, 
27contractor qualification and performance standards required by any other law, rule or 
28contract documents. If any of the provisions of this subchapter conflict with any other 
29law, rule or contract documents, the requirements of this subchapter prevail.
30§1826-V.  Application
31The requirements of this subchapter apply only to contracts executed after the 
32effective date of this subchapter, except that the exercise of an option on a contract 
33entered into prior to the effective date of this subchapter is deemed to create a new 
34contract for purposes of this subchapter.

27payment to that employer's employees of the compensation provided for by this Act fails 
28to do so, the employer is subject to the penalties set out in paragraphs A, B and C.  The 
29failure of any employer to procure insurance coverage for the payment of compensation 
30and other benefits to the employer's employees in compliance with sections 401 and 403 
31constitutes a failure to secure payment of compensation within the meaning of this 
32subsection, and such failure is subject to the penalties set out in paragraph D in addition 
33to the penalties set out in paragraphs A, B and C.  Any employer who knowingly 
34misrepresents employees as independent contractors or provides false, incomplete or 
35misleading information to an insurance company on the number of employees for the 
36purpose of paying a lower payment is subject to the penalties set out in paragraph E.
37A.  The employer is guilty of a Class D crime.  This paragraph applies only to cases 
38in which the employer has committed a knowing violation.
39B.  The employer is liable to pay a civil penalty of up to $10,000 or up to an amount 
40equal to 108% of the premium, calculated using Maine Employers' Mutual Insurance 
41Company's standard discounted standard premium, that should have been paid during 
42the period the employer failed to secure coverage, whichever is larger, payable to the 
Page 7 - 129LR0678(01)-11Employment Rehabilitation Fund.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be 
2assessed under this paragraph, the board shall take into consideration the employer's 
3effort to comply with sections 401 and 403.
4C.  The employer, if organized as a corporation, is subject to administrative 
5dissolution as provided in Title 13-C, section 1421 or revocation of its authority to do 
6business in this State as provided in Title 13-C, section 1532.  The employer, if 
7organized as a limited liability company, is subject to administrative dissolution as 
8provided in Title 31, section 1592. The employer, if licensed, certified, registered or 
9regulated by any board authorized by Title 5, section 12004-A or whose license may 
10be revoked or suspended by proceedings in the District Court or by the Secretary of 
11State, is subject to revocation or suspension of the license, certification or 
12registration.  This paragraph applies only to cases in which the employer has 
13committed a knowing violation, has failed to pay a penalty assessed pursuant to this 
14subsection or continues to operate without required coverage after a penalty has been 
15assessed pursuant to this subsection.
16D.  The executive director or the executive director's designee shall immediately issue 
17a stop-work order to the employer pursuant to this subsection for failure to procure 
18insurance coverage.  The executive director or the executive director's designee shall 
19hold a hearing to release the stop-work order within 24 to 48 hours after the employer 
20provides acceptable evidence to the executive director or the executive director's 
21designee that the employer has provided insurance coverage.
22E.  After giving the employer at least 3 business days' notice of a hearing regarding a 
23stop-work order, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall issue 
24a stop-work order pursuant to this subsection if the executive director or the executive 
25director's designee finds after the hearing that the employer knowingly 
26misrepresented employees as independent contractors or provided false, incomplete 
27or misleading information to an insurance company on the number of employees.  
28The executive director or the executive director's designee shall stay the issuance of a 
29stop-work order if the employer provides acceptable evidence of insurance to the 
30executive director or the executive director's designee.  Upon receipt of such 
31evidence, a hearing regarding the stop-work order must take place within 24 to 48 
32hours to release the stop-work order.
33For purposes of this subsection, a violation is considered a knowing violation if the 
34employer has previously obtained workers' compensation insurance and that insurance 
35has been cancelled or that insurance has not been continued or renewed, unless the 
36cancellation, failure to continue or nonrenewal is due to a substantial change in the 
37employer's operations that is unrelated to the classification of individuals as employees or 
38independent contractors; the employer has been notified in writing by the board of the 
39need for workers' compensation insurance; the employer has had one or more previous 
40violations of the requirement to secure the payment of the compensation provided for by 
41this Act; or the employer misclassifies an employee as an independent contractor despite 
42a contrary determination by the board.
43Prosecution under paragraph A does not preclude action under paragraph B or, C, D or E.
44If the employer is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, professional 
45corporation or any other legal business entity recognized under the laws of the State, any 
Page 8 - 129LR0678(01)-11agent of the corporation or legal business entity having primary responsibility for 
2obtaining insurance coverage is liable for punishment under this section. Criminal 
3liability must be determined in conformity with Title 17-A, sections 60 and 61.

9SUMMARY
10Part A, for the purpose of ensuring that the work on public construction contracts is 
11performed by responsible, qualified contractors that maintain the capacity, expertise, 
12personnel and other qualifications and resources necessary to successfully perform public 
13contracts in a timely, reliable and cost-effective manner, establishes responsible 
14contractor requirements for publicly funded construction projects that receive state funds.  
15The Part outlines a responsible contractor certification process to be administered by the 
16Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of General Services. 
17Part A also clarifies that, for the purpose of the law requiring fair minimum rate of 
18wages and benefits on public works contracts, "public works" includes any construction 
19projects funded all or in part with state funds.
20Part A also amends the method of determining the prevailing wage and benefits rate 
21paid in the construction industry to require the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor 
22Standards to ascertain the applicable wage and benefits rates established in collective 
23bargaining agreements in private construction and includes in benefits wages paid to 
24apprentices in apprenticeship programs registered with the department.
25Part B requires the Executive Director of the Workers' Compensation Board or the 
26executive director's designee to immediately issue a stop-work order to an employer who 
27fails to procure workers' compensation insurance coverage.  It requires the executive 
28director or the executive director's designee to issue a stop-work order to an employer if 
29the executive director or the executive director's designee finds after a hearing that the 
30employer knowingly misrepresented employees as independent contractors or provided 
31false, incomplete or misleading information to an insurance company on the numbers of 
32employees the employer has for the purpose of paying a lower payment.
33Part C encourages the State to use project labor agreements for large-scale state-
34funded construction projects of $10,000,000 or more.  A project labor agreement is a 
35prehire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor unions that establishes the 
36terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project.
37Part D requires an employer with a public works contract with the State of $50,000 or 
38more to provide to all employees who will be on the construction work site a safety 
39training program that uses a curriculum approved by the United States Department of 
40Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and that is at least 10 hours in 
41duration.  Flaggers, security workers and certain other employees not considered to be on 
Page 12 - 129LR0678(01)-11the work site are exempt from this requirement.  A contractor that violates this safety 
2training program requirement may be assessed a fine of up to $2,500 and an additional 
3fine of $100 per employee for each day of noncompliance.
4Part E provides that for public works construction contracts that involve funding from 
5the Federal Government the prevailing wage requirements in state law apply unless the 
6prevailing wage requirements that would otherwise apply under the federal Davis-Bacon 
7Act would result in higher total wages under the contract.  An exception is provided for 
8funds received under the United States Housing Act of 1937 if the application of a state 
9prevailing wage is expressly preempted by federal law.
