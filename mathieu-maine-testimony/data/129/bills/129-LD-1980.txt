2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5This bill proposes to create a tax credit for businesses that create positions that allow 
6their employees to work remotely from their homes or somewhere else outside of their 
7office or place of employment.  The credit is directly connected to the number of remote 
8positions created and filled. If a business eliminates a remote position, it would lose the 
9tax credit corresponding to that position.
