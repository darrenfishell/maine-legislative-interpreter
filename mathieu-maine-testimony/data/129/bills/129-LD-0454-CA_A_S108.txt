This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations totaling $274,025 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $420,746 in 
fiscal year 2020-21 to the School Finance and Operations program within the Department of Education to support the 
provision of the Local Produce Fund established pursuant to Title 20-A, section 6602, subsection 12. 
Of these amounts, $59,025 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $98,246 in fiscal year 2020-21 are provided for one Education 
Specialist II position and related All Other costs to administer the fund as well as to provide training to food staff, 
outreach to local farmers and to manage a new program to promote seasonally available local products. This fiscal 
estimate assumes an October 1, 2019 effective date. Additionally, $215,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 is appropriated to 
provide a $1 match for every $3 a school administrative unit (SAU) pays for produce or minimally processed foods 
purchased directly from eligible providers up to a maximum of $1,000 per SAU and $322,000 per year is 
appropriated beginning in fiscal year 2020-21 for matching funds up to a maximum of $1,500 per SAU. This bill 
also establishes that funds appropriated for this purpose are non-lapsing funds to be canied forward into the next 
fiscal year to be used only to support the provisions of the Local Produce Fund. 
This initiative is included in LD 1001, the 2020-2021 biennial budget and provides funding for the same provisions 
that are in this bill, except that the position is funded for a full year in fiscal year 2019-20 and there is no language in 
the budget initiative to allow for the funds to be carried into the next fiscal year instead of lapsing to the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund at the end of each fiscal year. If this initiative is included in the final 
budget approved by the Legislature, the fiscal note for this bill will need to be amended.
