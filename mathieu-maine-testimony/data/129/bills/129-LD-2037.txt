3SUMMARY
4This bill is submitted by the Criminal Law Advisory Commission pursuant to the 
5Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1354, subsection 2.
6Part A of the bill authorizes nonconcurrent sentencing when a crime is committed by 
7a convicted person during a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment or after failure 
8to report after a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment.  It also authorizes 
9nonconcurrent sentencing when the convicted person is convicted of the crime of failure 
10to report as ordered after a stay of execution of any term of imprisonment.
11Part B amends Title 17-A, section 2016 to make it consistent with existing law in 
12Title 17-A, section 2009 with respect to disposition of funds by  correctional facilities 
13when they hold funds for the purposes of restitution and the victim cannot be located.  
14Current Title 17-A, section 2016 requires the facility to notify the court and the court to 
15determine distribution of the funds.  The bill requires the facility to forward the funds to 
16the Treasurer of State to be handled as unclaimed property, consistent with current Title 
1717-A, section 2009.
18Part C separates 2 variants of kidnapping under Title 17-A, section 301, subsection 1, 
19paragraph A, subparagraph (3).  The crime of kidnapping with the intent to inflict bodily 
20injury is distinct from the crime of kidnapping with the intent to subject a person to 
21criminal activity defined in Title 17-A, chapter 11.  The latter remains a Tier III crime 
22requiring registration pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 
232013.  Crimes committed in violation of Title 17-A, section 301, subsection 1, paragraph 
24A, subparagraph (3) after the effective date of this legislation will not require registration.  
25In addition, this provision provides clarity in the Maine Criminal Code and a more 
26accurate reference for purposes of crime data.
27Part D clarifies that immunity from revocation of probation is limited to the same 
28conduct for which there is immunity from prosecution under the law protecting persons 
29seeking medical assistance or administering naloxone hydrochloride or experiencing a 
30drug-related overdose.
