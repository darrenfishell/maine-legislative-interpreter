presumed abandoned is void and unenforceable if it was entered into during the period 
commencing on the date the property was presumed abandoned and extending to a time 
that is 24 months after the date the property is paid or delivered to the administrator. This 
subsection does not apply to an owner's agreement with an attorney to file a claim as to 
identified property or contest the administrator's denial of a claim. 
2. Agreement requirements. An agreement by an owner the primary purpose of 
which is to locate, deliver, recover or assist in the recovery of property is enforceable 
only if the agreement is in writing, clearly sets forth the nature of the property and the 
services to be rendered, is signed by the apparent owner and states the value of the 
property before and after the fee or other compensation has been deducted. 
3. Mineral proceeds. If an agreement covered by this section applies to mineral 
proceeds and the agreement contains a provision to pay compensation that includes a 
portion of the underlying minerals or any mineral proceeds not then presumed 
abandoned, the provision is void and unenforceable. 
4. Unconscionable compensation. An agreement covered by this section that 
provides for compensation that is unconscionable is unenforceable except by the owner.

1 administrator on behalf of the owner, may maintain an action to reduce the compensation 
2 to a conscionable amount. The court may award reasonable attorney's fees to an owner 
3 who prevails in the action. 
4 5. Other grounds not precluded. This section does not preclude an owner from

6 unconscionable compensation. 
7 6. Limitation on fees or compensation. Fees or compensation under agreements 
8 made more than 24 months but less than 36 months after the date the property is paid or 
9 delivered to the administrator may not exceed 15%.

11 violation of this section commits an unfair trade practice in violation of Title 5, section 
12 207.'

14 L.D.) and inserting the following: 
15 '§2222. Transitional provision 
16 This Act does not relieve a holder of a duty that arose before October 1, 2019 to 
17 report, pay or deliver property. Subject to section 2120, subsection 2, a holder that did 
18 not comply with the law governing unclaimed property before October 1, 2019 is subject 
19 to applicable provisions for enforcement and penalties in effect before October 1, 2019.' 
20 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
21 section number to read consecutively. 
22 SUMMARY 
23 This amendment includes the definition of "game-related digital content" from the 
24 Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, or Uniform Act, and, consistent with the 
25 Uniform Act, exempts it from the definition of property that is subject to the Maine 
26 Revised Unclaimed Property Act and excludes it from the definition of "stored-value 
27 obligation." 
28 This amendment revises the definition of "owner" to include a creditor. 
29 This amendment amends the provision governing the presumption of abandonment 
30 for a payroll card or demand, savings or time deposit to track the language of the Uniform 
31 Act to provide that the property is presumed abandoned 3 years after the maturity of the 
32 deposit, deleting the reference to the last indication of interest by the owner. 
33 This amendment provides that the date on which the dormancy period begins to run is 
34 the date an insurance company has knowledge of the death of an insured, rather than the 
35 date of death as provided in the bill. 
36 The bill provides that a stored-value card is presumed abandoned on the latest of 2 
37 years after key events have occurred; this amendment changes that time period to 3 years. 
38 This amendment removes from the bill language providing that a security is 
39 presumed abandoned 2 years after the date of death of the owner.

32 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" fl "to S.P. 481, L.D. 1544 ( · '-'_.') \.) 
This amendment revises the bill to provide that automatic withdrawals previously 
authorized and automatic reinvestments of dividends and interest are included as an 
indication of an apparent owner's interest in the property. 
This amendment provides that interest on interest-bearing property that has been 
delivered to the administrator is not payable to the owner for any period before the 
effective date of the Maine Revised Unclaimed Property Act, unless the prior law 
authorized such payments. This provision is included in the Uniform Act. 
This amendment provides that the administrator may not commence an action or 
proceeding to enforce the Maine Revised Unclaimed Property Act with respect to the 
reporting, payment or delivery of property more than 5 years after the holder filed a 
nonfraudulent report with the administrator. The parties may agree in a record to extend 
the limitation. In addition, the administrator may not commence an action, proceeding or 
examination with respect to a duty of a holder under the Maine Revised Unclaimed 
Property Act more than 10 years after the duty arose. 
This amendment strikes out subchapter 13 in the bill and replaces it with the language 
of the current Maine Revised Statutes, Title 33, section 1976 with regard to agreements to 
locate property. This amendment provides that if a person with a claim held by the 
administrator enters into an agreement with a professional investigator licensed in the 
State, when the administrator has determined that a payment or property should be 
delivered to the claimant, the administrator is required to deliver the payment or property 
directly to the professional investigator. When such an agreement is in effect, the 
administrator is required to provide the claimant or the professional investigator with 
notice about the approval or denial of a claim. 
The bill includes transitional provisions from the Uniform Act that require that when 
an initial report is filed under the Maine Revised Unclaimed Property Act, it must include 
all property reportable under the Maine Revised Unclaimed Property Act for the prior 10 
years. It also requires that a duty that arose under the existing law to report, pay or 
deliver property is not relieved by the enactment of the Maine Revised Unclaimed 
Property Act. This amendment strikes the transition provision from the bill relating to 
reportable property for the prior 10 years.
