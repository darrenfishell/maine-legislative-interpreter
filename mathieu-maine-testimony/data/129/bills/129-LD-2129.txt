Page 1 - 129LR3231(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the federal Food and Drug Administration, in response to the passage of 
4the federal Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, released a statement announcing that it 
5is unlawful under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to introduce food containing 
6added cannabidiol into interstate commerce because it is an active ingredient in a 
7federally approved pharmaceutical drug; and
8Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of 
9Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry attempted to enforce federal policies regarding 
10food or food products containing cannabidiol within the State, and the 129th Legislature 
11responded by passing Public Law 2019, chapter 12 on an emergency basis and Public 
12Law 2019, chapter 528 to clarify Maine's hemp laws; and
13Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of 
14Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry issued new guidelines in November 2019 
15informing Maine businesses that food products may not be imported from out of state if 
16they already contain cannabidiol "since that is still a violation of federal law and the 
17Maine Food Code.  Ingestible products sold at retail in Maine must be produced in 
18Maine."  This statement has created anxiety and confusion among business owners, 
19stakeholders and consumers alike; and
20Whereas, any compliance with the guidelines from the Department of Health and 
21Human Services or the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will 
22undermine state sovereignty, diminish the livelihoods of Maine food producers and 
23retailers and deprive the people of Maine of the food that they consider necessary for 
24their own or their animals' health and well-being; and
25Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
26the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
27immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
28therefore,
29Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
30Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง2158-A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 528, ยง11, is further 
31amended to read:
32ยง2158-A.  Food, food additives and food products containing hemp not adulterated
33Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, food, food additives or food 
34products that contain hemp, including cannabidiol derived from hemp, are not considered 
35to be adulterated under this subchapter based solely on the inclusion of hemp or 
36cannabidiol derived from hemp or based solely on the place of origin of hemp or 
37cannabidiol derived from hemp or any other ingredient included in the food, food additive 
38or food product. The nonpharmaceutical or nonmedical production, manufacturing, 
39marketing, sale or distribution of food, food additives or food products within the State 
Page 2 - 129LR3231(01)-11that contain hemp may not be prohibited within the State based solely on the inclusion of 
2hemp or based solely on the place where the food, food additive or food product, or any 
3component thereof, including the hemp or cannabidiol, was manufactured, marketed, 
4previously sold or distributed. A food establishment or eating establishment, as defined in 
5section 2491, subsection 7, may not make a claim that food, food additives or food 
6products that contain hemp can diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease, condition or 
7injury without approval pursuant to federal law. For the purposes of this section, "hemp" 
8has the same meaning as in Title 7, section 2231, subsection 1-A, paragraph D and 
9"manufacturing" means producing, preparing, processing, propagating, blending, 
10infusing, compounding, concentrating or converting hemp or food, food additives or food 
11products containing hemp either directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of 
12natural origin or independently by means of chemical synthesis.
13Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
14legislation takes effect when approved.
15SUMMARY
16This bill provides that food, food additives and food products containing hemp, 
17including hemp-derived cannabidiol, that are produced and sold within the State are not 
18"adulterated" under state law regardless of the place of origin of the cannabidiol or any 
19other ingredient, and the production, manufacturing, marketing, sale or distribution of 
20food or food products containing hemp may not be prohibited regardless of where the 
21food or food products were produced, manufactured, marketed, sold or distributed 
22previously.
