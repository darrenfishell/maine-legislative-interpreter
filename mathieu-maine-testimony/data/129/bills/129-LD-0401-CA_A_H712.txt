basis; or 
(2) Is an owner of a manufacturing facility that has, since January 1, 2006, 
generated at least 85% of the solid waste disposed of at the solid waste facility, 
except that one or more integrated industrial processes of the manufacturing 
facility are no longer in common ownership, and those integrated industrial 
processes will continue to generate waste that will continue to be disposed of at

paragraph C; the recovery of metals from waste; the use of waste or waste­
derived product as material substitutes in construction; and the use of waste as 
boiler fuel substitutes. 
At least 50% of the waste that a solid waste processing facility characterizes as 
recycled under this subparagraph must have been reused or recycled by the 
facility through methods other than placement of the waste in a solid waste 
landfill. except that a solid waste processing facility that was in operation during 
calendar year 2018. that accepts exclusively construction and demolition debris 
and that accepted more than 200.000 tons of such debris in calendar year 2018 
shall: 
(a) Reuse or recycle at least 15% of such debris through methods other than 
placement in a solid waste landfill by January 1. 2022; and 
(b) Reuse or recycle at least 20% of such debris through methods other than

Sec. 8. 38 MRSA §1310-AA, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 566, §§4 and 
5, is further amended to read: 
3. Standards for determination. The commissioner shall find that the proposed 
facility under subsection 1 or the acceptance of waste that is not waste generated within 
the State under subsection 1-A provides a substantial public benefit if the applicant 
demonstrates to the commissioner that the proposed facility or the acceptance of waste 
that is not waste generated within the State: 
A. Meets immediate, short-term or long-term capacity needs of the State. For 
purposes of this paragraph, "immediate" means within the next 3 years, "short-term" 
means within the next 5 years and 11long-term11 means within the next 10 years. When 
evaluating whether a proposed facility meets the capacity needs of the State, the 
commissioner shall consider relevant local and regional needs as appropriate and the 
regional nature of the development and use of disposal capacity due to transportation 
distances and other factors; 
B. Except for expansion of a commercial solid waste disposal facility that accepts 
only special waste for landfilling, is consistent with the state waste management and 
recycling plan and promotes the solid waste management hierarchy as set out in 
section 2101; 
C. Is not inconsistent with local, regional or state waste collection, storage, 
transportation, processing or disposal; and 
D. For a determination of public benefit under subsection 1-A only, facilitates the 
operation of a solid waste disposal facility and the operation of that solid waste 
disposal facility would be precluded or significantly impaired if the waste is not 
accepted. 
Sec. 9. Department of Environmental Protection; 2024 update to state 
waste management and recycling plan. The Department of Environmental 
Protection shall include in its 2024 update to the state waste management and recycling 
plan required under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 2122 an evaluation of 
and any recommendations concerning the provisions of Title 38, section 1310-N, 
subsection 5-A, paragraph B, subparagraph (2) and whether amendments to those 
provisions are necessary.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment adds 
defmitions to the State's solid waste management laws for the terms "recycling facility11 
and "waste generated within the State" and amends certain other related definitions and 
provisions within the solid waste management laws consistent with those new definitions. 
It also provides that at least 50% of the waste characterized as recycled by a solid waste 
processing facility that generates residue requiring disposal must have been reused or 
recycled through methods other than landfilling but includes specific alternative
