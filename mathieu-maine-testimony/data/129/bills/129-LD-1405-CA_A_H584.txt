waiver of foreclosure and the consent of the mortgagor to the waiver must be included in 
a stipulation of dismissal of the foreclosure and signed by the mortgagee and mortgagor 
or their respective attorneys, and, upon the filing of the stipulation of dismissal with the 
court, all other rights of all other parties remain as if no foreclosure had been 
commenced. The mortgagee shall sell the premises to the highest bidder at the public 
sale and deliver a deed of that sale and the any writ of possession, if a writ of possession 
was obtained ffili'ing the foreclosure process, that has been issued to the purchaser. The 
deed conveys the premises free and clear of all interests of the parties in interest joined in 
the action. The mortgagee or any other party in interest may bid at the public sale. If the 
mortgagee is the highest bidder at the public sale, there is no obligation to account for any 
surplus upon a subsequent sale by the mortgagee. Any rights of the mortgagee to a 
deficiency claim against the mortgagors are limited to the amount established as of the 
date of the public sale. The date of the public sale is the date on which bids are received 
to establish the sales price, no matter when the sale is completed by the delivery of the 
deed to the highest bidder. If the property is conveyed by deed pursuant to a public sale 
in accordance with this subsection, a copy of the judgment of foreclosure and evidence of 
compliance with the requirements of this subsection for the notice of public sale and the 
public sale itself must be attached to or included within the deed, or both, or otherwise be 
recorded in the registry of deeds. 
Sec. 2. 14 MRSA §6324, as amended by PL 2003, c. 20, Pt. T, §10, is further 
amended by adding at the end a new paragraph to read: 
The report of sale required by this section must be filed with the court within the 
earlier of 90 days after the public sale and 45 days after the mortgagee's delive1y of the 
deed conveying the mortgaged property to the purchaser at the mortgage sale. Upon a 
showing of good cause by the mortgagee, made by motion filed before the expiration of 
the deadline, the court may extend the deadline for the filing of the report of sale for an 
additional period of time as the court considers appropriate. In the event that the 
mortgagee fails to timely file the report of sale, the mortgagee has no right to seek a 
deficiency judgment.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment amends time limits in the bill to provide that a sale may be 
adjourned for any time not exceeding 60 days and the court may grant appropriate 
extensions. 
It provides that, when there is a waiver of foreclosure, the waiver and the consent of 
the mortgagor must be included in a stipulation of dismissal of the foreclosure. The 
stipulation of dismissal must be signed by the mortgagee and mortgagor or their 
respective attorneys. Upon the filing of the stipulation of dismissal, along with the 
waiver and consent with the court, all other rights of the parties remain as if no 
foreclosure had been commenced. 
It extends the time for the mortgagee to file a report of sale within the earlier of 90 
days after the public sale and 45 days after the mortgagee's delivery of the deed 
conveying the mortgaged property. The court may extend the deadline upon a showing 
of good cause by the mortgagee.
