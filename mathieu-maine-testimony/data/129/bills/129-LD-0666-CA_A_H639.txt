SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the definition of "pregnancy-related condition" to provide 
that the limitation on the pregnant employee's ability to perform the functions of a job due 
to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, including lactation, must be 
lmown. 
The amendment revises the description of unlawful employment discrimination to 
apply to. an employer's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation after it has been 
requested. An exception to the reasonable accommodation requirement is based on the 
employer's demonstration that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on 
the operation of the business of the employer. 
The amendment provides examples ofreasonable accommodations.
