8SUMMARY
9This bill removes changes that were made by Public Law 2011, chapter 647 to the 
10law governing the statute of limitations for workers' compensation claims and restores the 
11law to the language that was held by the Law Court in Wilson v. Bath Iron Works, 942 
12A.2d 1237 (Me. 2008) to mean that, for purposes of filing a petition under the workers' 
13compensation laws, the statute of limitations expires 2 years after the date of injury or 2 
14years after the date the employer files the first report of injury, whichever is later.
