Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Adding dispatchers to the categories of participating local district (PLD) employees that are eligible for a special 
retirement plan as long as the plan requires the dispatcher to have at least 25 years of creditable service will have no 
fiscal impact on the State as the responsibility for the cost of the PLD plan and any increased employer costs as a 
result of this legislation are borne by the PLD's.
