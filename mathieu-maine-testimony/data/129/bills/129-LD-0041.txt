33utilities and energy matters that includes the results of this proceeding.  The Public 
34Utilities Commission shall also explore rate design options that would be in the best 
35interest of ratepayers and support the long-term, sustainable development of distributed 
36generation.
37Sec. 5.  Rules.  The Public Utilities Commission shall amend its net energy billing 
38rule to be consistent with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A and

Page 4 - 129LR0299(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill does the following regarding net energy billing:
31.  It allows an eligible customer to elect net energy billing until December 31, 2019, 
4after which time no new net energy billing arrangements may be allowed;
52.  It allows net energy billing arrangements entered into prior to December 31, 2019 
6to remain in effect until December 31, 2034;
73.  It prohibits a transmission and distribution utility from requiring a customer to 
8meter the gross output of an eligible facility in order to participate in net energy billing; 
9and
104.  It limits to 50 the number of eligible customers that may participate in a single 
11shared interest in an eligible facility or the number of meters associated with a single 
12shared interest, except in the service territory of a transmission and distribution utility 
13located in an area administered by the independent system administrator for northern 
14Maine.
15The bill establishes a market-based crediting system for energy generated by eligible 
16facilities. It requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules to allow an eligible 
17customer to receive a monetary credit for energy generated by an eligible facility in 
18excess of the customer's usage and exported to the grid at the real-time wholesale market 
19price of that energy. As in the provisions relating to net energy billing, a transmission and 
20distribution utility is prohibited from requiring a customer to meter the gross output of an 
21eligible facility in order to participate in the crediting system, and the number of eligible 
22customers that may participate in a single shared interest in an eligible facility, or the 
23number of meters associated with a single shared interest, is limited to 50. The bill 
24exempts a transmission and distribution utility located in an area administered by the 
25independent system administrator for northern Maine, or any successor of the 
26independent system administrator for northern Maine, from using this crediting system 
27until the Public Utilities Commission determines the utility's billing system can perform 
28the necessary functions to implement the system. It requires the commission to consider 
29whether an alternative system to the crediting system for northern Maine could be 
30developed and utilized in the interim period before the utility's billing system is modified 
31to allow a market-based crediting system.
32It requires the Public Utilities Commission to procure, to the maximum extent 
33possible, 20 megawatts of large-scale community solar distributed generation resources. 
34It requires that the contract rate be calculated annually and that no contract may be for 
35more than 6¢ per kilowatt-hour or the average wholesale electricity rate over the 
36preceding 12 months, whichever is less.
37Lastly, it requires the Public Utilities Commission to conduct an analysis of the costs 
38and benefits to ratepayers for both net energy billing and the market-based crediting 
39system in an adjudicatory proceeding and to report those findings to the joint standing 
40committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters no later 
41than January 1, 2021.
