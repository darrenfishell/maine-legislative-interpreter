Presented by Representative DEVIN of  Newcastle.

Page 1 - 129LR0634(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, plantations conduct official business that must be attended to on a daily 
4basis, mostly by a small group of officials; and
5Whereas, the inability to remove officials from office in plantations when those 
6officials either fail to perform the duties required of the office or engage in misconduct 
7directly affects the ability of the plantation to conduct its official business, which has a 
8negative effect on the public interest and is of a direct concern to the State; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12therefore,
13Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
14Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง7011 is enacted to read:
