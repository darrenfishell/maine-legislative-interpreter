SUMMARY 
2 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill and adds an emergency preamble and 
3 emergency clause. The amendment provides that the Department of Administrative and 
4 Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations is required to 
5 set the price of spirits produced by a licensed Maine small distillery and retained by that 
6 small distillery for sale directly to customers at a discount of 22.75% off the list price. 
7 This discount rate is greater than the discount that an agency liquor store is given off of 
8 the list price when it purchases spirits produced by a small distillery because, unlike 
9 spirits purchased by an agency liquor store, the spirits retained by the small distillery are 
10 not transported to a warehouse operated by the bureau or by a wholesaler contracted by 
11 the bureau and then distributed by that wholesaler to another location.

Fiscal Note 
Revenue decrease -State Alcoholic Beverage Fund 
Revenue increase -Licensed Maine Small Distilleries 
This bill requires that the pricing of spirits produced by a licensed Maine small distillery and retained by that small 
distillery for sale directly to the customer include a discount rate of 22.75% off the list price for spirits. Because the 
retailer retains the discount rate portion of the list price of spirits and the increased discount rate only applies to small 
distilleries acting as their own retailer, this change will generate additional revenue for small distilleries and will 
decrease revenue to the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations by the same amount. The amount of 
revenue shift is not expected to be significant.
