28SUMMARY
29Under current law, a minor who has been living separately from parents or legal 
30guardians for at least 60 days and is independent of parental support may provide consent 
31to all medical, mental, dental and other health counseling and services.
32This bill allows a minor to provide consent to all medical, mental, dental and other 
33health counseling and services by proving that the minor is living separately and is 
34independent of parental support through various means such as a written, signed 
35statement to that fact from the director of a governmental or nonprofit agency that 
36provides services to homeless persons or an attorney representing the minor or proof of 
37filing for emancipation.
Page 2 - 129LR1513(01)-11This bill also provides immunity to a health care practitioner who provides services to 
2a minor if the minor consented to those services and provided proof of living separately 
3and independently.  Finally, this bill prohibits a minor or other person from disaffirming 
4the consent given by the minor solely because the minor is a minor.
