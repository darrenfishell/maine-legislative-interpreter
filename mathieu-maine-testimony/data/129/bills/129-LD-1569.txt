22firearms pursuant to section 2015, on untraceable firearms pursuant to section 2016 and 
23on the dissemination of downloadable gun code pursuant to section 2016 are necessary to 
24ensure that undetectable and untraceable firearms, as defined in sections 2015 and 2016, 
25respectively, are clearly prohibited in the State, except as specifically provided.  The 
26Legislature further finds that these restrictions are necessary to discourage and prevent 
27the dissemination of firearms that are undetectable in metal detectors and other security 
28screening devices, that are untraceable due to the lack of a serial number or other form of 
29required firearm identification and that can readily be possessed by those who may not be 
30legally able to do so under existing federal and state laws.  The Legislature finds that the 
31restrictions imposed pursuant to sections 2015 and 2016 are necessary to prevent the 
32widespread possession of these dangerous weapons before they become a prevalent 
33problem in this State and a threat to the health and well-being of the residents of this 
34State.
35SUMMARY
36This bill regulates the manufacture, distribution and possession of so-called ghost 
37guns and so-called 3-D printed guns or 3-D guns, which are fully functioning firearms 
38that can be made at home by unlicensed firearm manufacturers, sellers and distributors 
39either by purchasing the necessary parts separately, or as part of mail order gun kits, and 
40then assembling them at home or by downloading a computer code from the Internet that 
41allows the user to manufacture the gun using a 3-D printer.  This bill provides definitions 
42of "undetectable firearm" and "untraceable firearm" and prohibits the manufacture, 
Page 4 - 129LR1477(01)-11import, sale, transfer and possession of such firearms with certain exceptions.  This bill 
2also prohibits, with certain exceptions, the dissemination of downloadable gun code from 
3which untraceable firearms can be manufactured.
