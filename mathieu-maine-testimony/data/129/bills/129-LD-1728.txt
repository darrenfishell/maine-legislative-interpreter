2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, it is urgent for the harness racing industry in this State to align harness 
4racing laws with current policy and the policies of every other racing jurisdiction across 
5the country and to have this alignment take effect as soon as possible; and
6Whereas, current statutory language undermines the integrity of harness racing in 
7this State and the confidence of the wagering public and threatens the future of the 
8industry; and
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as

16SUMMARY
17This bill allows for the disqualification of horses participating in harness racing that 
18are found in violation of the laws and rules governing prohibited substances and 
19allowable levels of permitted medication and allows for the forfeiture of any purses won 
20by horses in violation of those laws and rules.  It also removes language that requires the 
21Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to provide a booklet containing 
22harness racing laws and rules to harness racing licensees and instead requires the 
23department to provide public access to those laws and rules.
