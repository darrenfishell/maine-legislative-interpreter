32SUMMARY
33This bill changes the definition of "small brewery" by increasing the amount of malt 
34liquor a small brewery may brew from 50,000 gallons to 30,000 barrels per year.  It 
35defines a "small beer manufacturer" as a small brewery or out-of-state brewer that is 
36brewing, lagering and kegging, bottling or packaging its own malt liquor, not to exceed 
3730,000 barrels per year.  If a small beer manufacturer terminates its distribution 
38relationship with a wholesale licensee, unless for good cause, causes a wholesale licensee 
39to resign from an agreement, unless for good cause, or unreasonably withholds its consent 
40to any assignment, transfer or sale of a wholesale licensee's business and that small beer 
41manufacturer's brands make up no more than 3% of the wholesale licensee's business, the 
42bill sets the maximum amount of the termination fee that the wholesale licensee is 
43entitled to receive from that small beer manufacturer in connection with the termination.  
44The bill amends the laws governing certain notice requirements that the small beer 
45manufacturer must satisfy in connection with the termination, provides expedited 
Page 6 - 129LR0939(01)-11arbitration proceedings for a small beer manufacturer and a wholesale licensee in 
2connection with a dispute regarding the amount of the termination fee and provides that, 
3regardless of whether the terminated wholesale licensee has received payment of the 
4termination fee from the small beer manufacturer, upon written notice of the termination 
5to the wholesale licensee, the small beer manufacturer may appoint a new wholesale 
6licensee to distribute the relevant products in the terminated wholesale licensee's territory 
7or, if the small beer manufacturer is a small brewery, sell the terminated brand or brands 
8of the small beer manufacturer directly to retail licensees in the terminated wholesale 
9licensee's territory without selling the brand or brands to a wholesale licensee.  Lastly, 
10this bill allows a wholesale licensee and a small beer manufacturer to agree upon or limit 
11the amount of a termination fee pursuant to a distribution agreement as long as that 
12termination fee does not exceed the maximum amount of the termination fee, as set forth 
13in the bill.
