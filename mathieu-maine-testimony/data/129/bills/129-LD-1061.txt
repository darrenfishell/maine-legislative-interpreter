22SUMMARY
23This bill creates the Unjustly Incarcerated Persons Compensation Fund and 
24establishes compensation amounts and a process for the application for and determination 
25of compensation.  The bill establishes compensation of $25,000 per year of unjust 
26incarceration and $10,000 for each year that the person eligible for compensation was 
27required to register as a sex offender. 
28The bill provides for compensation payments to be made in a lump sum, and only in a 
29lump sum in the case of a deceased person, or as an annuity.
30A person is eligible to seek compensation if the person has served in whole or in part 
31a sentence of imprisonment under the laws of this State and the person has:
321.  Received a full and free pardon on the basis of innocence for the crime for which 
33the person was sentenced;
342.  Has been granted relief in accordance with a writ of habeas corpus that is based on 
35a court finding or determination that the person is actually innocent of the crime for 
36which the person was sentenced; or
Page 5 - 129LR0983(01)-113.  Has been granted relief in accordance with a writ of habeas corpus and the court in 
2which the person was convicted has entered an order dismissing the charge.  The court's 
3dismissal order must be based on a motion to dismiss in which the district attorney or the 
4Attorney General states that no credible evidence exists that inculpates the defendant and, 
5either in the motion or in an affidavit, the district attorney or the Attorney General states 
6that the district attorney or Attorney General believes that the defendant is actually 
7innocent of the crime for which the person was sentenced.
8The bill repeals the existing law providing a maximum payment of $300,000 for 
9wrongful imprisonment that is based on a pardon granted on the basis of innocence.
