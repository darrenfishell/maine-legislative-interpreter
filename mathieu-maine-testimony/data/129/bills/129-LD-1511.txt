36SUMMARY
37This bill implements statutory changes recommended by the Right To Know 
38Advisory Committee pursuant to its responsibility to review existing public records 
39exceptions.
Page 4 - 129LR2400(01)-11The bill eliminates specific protection for social security numbers in the context of 
2constituent communications because social security numbers are designated as not public 
3records for all contexts.
4Current law provides that personally identifying information concerning minors that 
5is obtained or maintained by a municipality in providing recreational or nonmandatory 
6educational programs or services is not a public record as long as the municipality has 
7adopted an ordinance that protects the information from disclosure.  The bill repeals the 
8requirement that a municipality adopt such an ordinance in order to protect the 
9information about minors. 
10Current law provides a public record exception for records or information describing 
11the architecture, design, access authentication, encryption or security of information 
12technology infrastructure, systems and software.  The bill amends the provision to 
13specifically include records or information maintained to ensure government operations 
14and technology continuity and to enable disaster recovery.
15The bill amends the statutes governing the confidentiality of the working papers of 
16the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability to clarify that the 
17working papers, whether in the possession of the office or an entity with which the office 
18director has contracted, remain confidential even after the report is released to the public.  
19It removes duplicative language that is already captured in the definition of "working 
20papers."
21The bill amends the Maine Human Rights Act to update and clarify the language 
22describing medical history and information about disabilities, as well as to update a 
23reference to employee health and wellness programs.
