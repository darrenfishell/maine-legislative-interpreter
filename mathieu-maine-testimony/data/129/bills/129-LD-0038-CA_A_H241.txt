The bill requires the State Employee Health Plan to offer hearing aid coverage at a minimum of $3,000 per hearing 
aid. Based on information provided by the state health plan on the incidence of hearing loss among plan members and 
national statistics on the percentage of individuals with hearing loss who use hearing aids, it is estimated that 
premiums for the state plan will increase by $1.09 per member per month. The total cost to the plan is estimated to be 
$347 ,319 annually for the 26,550 current plan members. The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $158,492 in 
fiscal year 2020-21 and Highway Fund allocations of $56, 779 in fiscal year 2020-21 to state departments and agencies 
that pay premiums to the health plan to cover the increased premium costs for those two funds. The remaining costs of 
$132,047 will be absorbed by multiple funds across state government. It is expected that coverage of hearing aids 
under the State Employee Health Plan will begin on or after July 1, 2020.
