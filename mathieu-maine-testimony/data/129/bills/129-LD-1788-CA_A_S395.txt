This bill would eliminate the $7 fee the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) charges for 
electronically issued burn permits via their online permit system. Cuuently, $4 is deposited into the General Fund, $2 
is transfeued to the municipality where the pennit was issued and $1 goes to InforME for the administrative cost of 
the online permit system. In unorganized areas, $6 of the fee is deposited into the General Fund and $1 is for the 
administrative costs oflnforME. Begim1ing in fiscal year 2020-21, elimination of the fee would reduce annual 
General Fund revenue by $43,139, reduce revenue to municipalities by approximately $20,000 a year and reduce 
revenue available to pay InforME by $9,600. The bill includes an ongoing General Fund appropriation to ACF of 
$9,600 beginning in fiscal year 2020-21 to continue to pay InforME for bum pennits issued through the state online 
system. Municipalities may incur additional costs if the vendor or owner of a private party bum pennit software 
system chooses to impose fees for its use.
