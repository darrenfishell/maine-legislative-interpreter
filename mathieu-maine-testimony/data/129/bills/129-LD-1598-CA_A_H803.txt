15SUBCHAPTER 2-A
16MAINTENANCE OF PRIVATE ROADS
17§3121.  Responsibility for cost of repairs to and maintenance of private roads
181.  Cost sharing.  If more than one property shares a common benefit from a private 
19road, each property owner that shares the common benefit is responsible for a share of the 
20cost of reasonable and necessary repairs to and maintenance of that private road 
21determined pursuant to the terms of any agreement entered into to determine the share of 
22the cost of reasonable and necessary repairs to and maintenance of the private road, any 
23deed restriction, covenant or declaration applicable to the benefited property, any road 
24association created pursuant to this chapter or otherwise or any method elected under 
25section 3101, when applicable.  In the absence of any such agreement, restriction, 
26covenant, declaration, road association or method elected under section 3101, each 
27residential property owner, after reasonable due process and notice, shall share equally in 
28the cost of reasonable and necessary repairs to and maintenance of the private road when 
29the private road is the primary means of access to the benefited property.  For purposes of 
30this subchapter, each residential property may be assessed only one share toward the

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT12.  Repairs and maintenance defined.  For the purposes of this subchapter, "repairs 
2and maintenance" has the same meaning as set forth in section 3101, subsection 1, 
3paragraph B.
43.  Enforcement.  If a residential property owner fails, after a demand in writing, to 
5pay that owner's share of the cost of reasonable and necessary repairs to and maintenance 
6of the private road in accordance with subsection 1, a legal claim for payment of the 
7amount owed may be brought against the owner of the property by a residential owner or 
8owners who share a common benefit in the road, either jointly or severally.
94.  Conflict.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section and 
10an agreement, restriction, covenant, declaration, road association or method elected in 
11section 3101 existing on or entered into after the effective date of this section, the terms 
12of the agreement, restriction, covenant, declaration, road association or method elected in 
13section 3101 control.
145.  Exceptions.  This section does not apply to:
15A.  A private road constructed or primarily used for commercial or forest 
16management purposes; or
17B.  A property owner who issues a ground lease to a 3rd party who maintains a 
18residence on the subject property.  For purposes of this section, a ground lease is an 
19arrangement under which a property owner leases only land to a lessee and the lessee 
20retains the rights to use the land and any improvements the lessee makes for the term 
21of the lease.' 
22Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
23section number to read consecutively.
24SUMMARY
25This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.  
26It replaces the bill.
27The amendment enacts a new subchapter in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, 
28chapter 305, which concerns local road construction and repair, to address the 
29responsibility for the repair and maintenance of private roads that benefit residential 
30properties.  It is limited in application to residential properties only.  Unless there is an 
31agreement, deed restriction, covenant or declaration or road association that specifies the 
32cost to be paid by each owner of a benefited property, the cost is shared equally by the 
33benefited properties.  Each residential property is subject to cost sharing, not each 
34residential property owner; each residential property is assessed one share of the 
35collective costs of repairs and maintenance regardless of whether there are multiple 
36owners of record for that property.  An owner who fails to comply may be forced to 
37comply through an action brought by other owners on the private road.
38The amendment uses the definition of "repairs and maintenance" provided in the law 
39that applies to road associations.
40The provisions do not apply to a private road constructed or used primarily for 
41commercial or forest management purposes or to a property owner who issues a ground

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1lease to a 3rd party who maintains a residence on the subject property.  "Ground lease" is 
2defined for the purposes of this law as an arrangement under which a property owner 
3leases only land to the lessee and the lessee retains the rights to use the land and any 
4improvements the lessee makes for the term of the lease.
