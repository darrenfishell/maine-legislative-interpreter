10judge or justice shall issue an order under section 1026.  If the judicial finding is 
11otherwise, the judge or justice shall issue an order denying bail.
12SUMMARY
13This bill amends the Maine Bail Code in the following ways. It:
141.  Clarifies the rebuttable presumption that, except for formerly capital offenses, a 
15defendant must be released on personal recognizance with no conditions;
162.  Increases the burden of proof for justifying not releasing a defendant on personal 
17recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond;
183.  Removes from the list of authorized bail conditions the condition of refraining 
19from the possession, use or excessive use of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, the condition 
20of reporting on a regular basis to the defendant's attorney and the condition of returning to 
21custody for specified hours after work release, schooling or other purposes;
224.  Removes from bail conditions requirements that the defendant refrain from 
23criminal conduct and that the integrity of the judicial system be ensured;
245.  Makes changes to the information that must be taken into account when 
25determining bail for the defendant;
266.  Requires a judicial officer when determining bail to find by clear and convincing 
27evidence that imposing a financial condition on a defendant will not cause excessive 
28financial hardship on the defendant and requires that judicial officer to state on the record 
29or in writing the findings upon which the determination is made; and
307.  Adds to the list of facts a judicial officer must consider when determining bail 
31whether the defendant is the primary person responsible for the care of another, has a 
32health care need including a mental health care need that is being met or would be better 
33met outside of custody or has employment that would be affected if the defendant is 
34placed in custody.
