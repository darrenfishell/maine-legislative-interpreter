33SUMMARY
34This bill makes the following changes to the income tax and service provider tax 
35laws.
Page 7 - 129LR2993(01)-11Part A updates, clarifies and simplifies the service provider tax law regarding 
2consumer purchases of digital media by equalizing the tax treatment between the various 
3modes of purchase for sales occurring on or after October 1, 2020.
4Part B clarifies and simplifies the corporate income tax law by establishing clearly 
5defined, objective nexus thresholds as a practical structure for the current general 
6"economic nexus" standard.  These so-called factor presence thresholds clarify the 
7minimum thresholds that, when exceeded by a corporation, subject that corporation to the 
8Maine corporate income tax.  In addition, the new thresholds create a safe harbor for 
9corporations with little activity within the State that nonetheless have nexus under current 
10law due to a small, but greater than de minimis, physical presence in the State.  The new 
11thresholds are $250,000 of property, $250,000 in payroll or $500,000 in sales in Maine, 
12or 25% of total property, payroll or sales in Maine, as determined under the Maine 
13Revised Statutes, Title 36, chapter 821.  The thresholds apply to tax years beginning on or 
14after January 1, 2021.
15Part C updates the individual income tax law by extending and aligning inflation 
16indexing provisions in 2 respects.  First, the bill indexes the recently enacted dependent 
17exemption tax credit for inflation.  Second, the bill aligns inflation indexing for the lowest 
18income tax brackets and the highest income tax brackets by allowing an additional one-
19year inflation adjustment for the highest income tax bracket, indexing the dollar amounts 
20to the same inflation benchmark, the Chained Consumer Price Index for the 12-month 
21period ending June 30, 2015.  These changes apply to tax years beginning on or after 
22January 1, 2021.
23Part D updates and simplifies Maine income tax law by conforming the Maine 
24income tax with the federal net operating loss limitation.  This Part applies retroactively 
25to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
