HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "g, to H.P. 397, L.D. 540, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Qualifications for District Attorneys" 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 2 (page 1, lines 5 to 10 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'2. Qualifications. Only attorneys admitted to the general practice of lav,r in this an 
attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the State, who has not been 
suspended from the practice of law in this State or in any other jurisdiction during the 
previous 10 years and who reside resides in the prosecutorial district may be elected or 
appointed district attorney. Removal from the prosecutorial district or disbatment or 
suspension from the practice of law vacates the office. For purposes of this subsection, a 
person is a "member in good standing of the bar of the State" if that person is admitted to 
the practice of law in this State, is presently registered with the Board of Overseers of the 
Bar as an active practitioner and is not currently disbarred or suspended from practice in 
this State pursuant to Title 4, chapter 17, subchapter 2 or the Maine Bar Rules. If the 
person has been suspended from practice in this State or any other jurisdiction, the 
suspension must have ended at least 10 years before the person's election or appointment 
as district attorney.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Pait letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
The bill provides for the disqualification of a person to be elected or appointed 
district attorney if the person has been suspended from the practice of law within the 
previous 10 years. It also provides that disbarment or suspension during the term of 
office results in the person vacating the office. This amendment retains these provisions. 
This amendment requires a district attorney to be a "member in good standing of the 
bar of the State," which is consistent with the generally accepted standard of qualification 
of attorneys for positions. Language from the law governing qualifications for the 
Attorney General is added to the law governing qualifications for a district attorney to
