24article as a means to the person being able to return to substantially gainful activity.  As a 
25condition of entering into an agreement to provide rehabilitation services, the executive 
26director must determine that rehabilitation is feasible, that rehabilitation is consistent with 
27the purposes of this article, that the recipient is suitable for rehabilitation services and that 
28rehabilitation services are likely to lead to substantially gainful activity.  When 
29appropriate, determination of suitability must include consultation with the medical board 
30to determine any medical indications that the recipient should not engage in a 
31rehabilitation program or to identify a recipient too severely disabled to benefit from 
32rehabilitation services in accordance with the purposes of this article.  Services must be 
33provided by private and public rehabilitation counselors, government agencies and others 
34approved by the executive director as qualified to provide rehabilitation services.  The 
35executive director shall consider a rehabilitation counselor's rate of successfully placing 
36rehabilitated employees in jobs relative to the placement rates of other counselors in the 
37State as fundamental in deciding whether to approve the counselor as qualified.  This 
38section does not affect the ongoing requirement that a person remain disabled in order to 
39continue to receive disability benefits.
40Sec. 29.  5 MRSA §18529, sub-§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2003, c. 675, §4, is 
41further amended to read:
Page 10 - 129LR2648(01)-11B.  The executive director may require, once each year, that the person undergo 
2examinations or tests, conducted in accordance with section 18526, to determine the 
3person's disability.  The executive director may refer the records documenting the 
4results of the examinations or tests and the person's file to the medical board for 
5medical consultation regarding rehabilitation in accordance with section 17106, 
6subsection 3, paragraph E.
7(1)  After the disability has continued for 2 years, the disability must render the 
8person unable to engage in any substantially gainful activity that is consistent 
9with the person's training, education or experience and average final 
10compensation adjusted by the same percentage adjustment as has been received 
11under section 18407.  The disability retirement benefit continues if the person can 
12effectively demonstrate to the executive director that the person is actively 
13seeking work.  For purposes of this subparagraph, the ability to engage in 
14substantially gainful activity is demonstrated by the ability to perform work 
15resulting in annual earnings that exceed $20,000 or 80% of the recipient's average 
16final compensation at retirement, whichever is greater, adjusted by the same 
17percentage adjustments granted under section 18407.
18(2)  If the person refuses to submit to the examinations or tests under this 
19paragraph, the disability retirement benefit is discontinued until that person 
20withdraws the refusal.
21(3)  If the person's refusal under subparagraph (2) continues for one year, all 
22rights to any further benefits under this article cease.
23(4)  If it is determined, on the basis of the examinations or tests under this 
24paragraph, that the disability of a person no longer exists, the payment of the 
25disability retirement benefit ceases.
26(5)  The executive director shall notify the person in writing of the decision to 
27discontinue the disability retirement allowance under subparagraph (2) or (4).
28(a)  The decision is subject to appeal under section 17451.
29(b)  If the person appeals the executive director's decision, the disability 
30retirement allowance may not be discontinued until all appeals have been 
31exhausted.
32Sec. 30.  5 MRSA §18530, sub-§2, ¶C, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 409, §§11 and 
3312, is amended to read:
34C.  If, during the first 5 years of reemployment, the person again becomes disabled, 
35terminates employment and is not covered by any other disability program, the 
36retirement system shall resume paying the disability retirement benefit payable prior 
37to the reemployment with all applicable cost-of-living adjustments and shall provide 
38rehabilitation services under in accordance with section 18527 if recommended by 
39the medical board.  If the benefit payable under the other disability program is not 
40equal to or greater than the benefit under this article, the retirement system shall pay 
41the difference between the amount of the benefit payable under the other disability 
42program and the amount of the benefit payable under this article.  The executive 
Page 11 - 129LR2648(01)-11director shall require examinations or tests to determine whether the person is 
2disabled as described in section 18521; and
3Sec. 31.  5 MRSA §18530, sub-§3, ¶E, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 409, §§11 and 
412, is amended to read:
5E.  If, during the first 5 years of reemployment, the person again becomes disabled 
6and terminates employment, the retirement system shall resume paying the disability 
7retirement benefit payable prior to the reemployment with all applicable cost-of-
8living adjustments, or if greater, a disability retirement benefit based upon the 
9person's current average final compensation and shall provide rehabilitation services 
10under in accordance with section 18527 if recommended by the medical board.  The 
11executive director shall require examinations or tests to determine whether the person 
12is disabled as defined in section 18521; and
13Sec. 32.  5 MRSA §18553, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 1991, c. 469, §5, is 
14further amended to read:
15A.    A surviving spouse of the qualifying member is paid a $150 benefit each month 
16beginning the first month after the death occurs and continuing during the surviving 
17spouse's lifetime, if:
18(1)  The deceased qualifying member had 10 years of creditable service at the 
19time of death; or
20(2)  The surviving spouse is certified by the medical board an independent health 
21care provider to be permanently mentally incompetent or permanently physically 
22incapacitated and is determined by the executive director to be unable to engage 
23in any substantially gainful employment.
24A full month's benefit is paid to the estate of the surviving spouse for the month in 
25which the surviving spouse dies.
26Sec. 33.  5 MRSA §18553, sub-§5-A, ¶A, as amended by PL 1991, c. 469, §5, is

31beneficiary is certified by the medical board an independent health care provider to 
32be permanently mentally incompetent or permanently physically incapacitated and is 
33determined by the executive director to be unable to engage in any substantially 
34gainful employment.
35SUMMARY
36This bill amends the laws relating to disability retirement under the Maine Public 
37Employees Retirement System and makes other changes relating to the structure of the 
38Maine Public Employees Retirement System.  This bill:
Page 12 - 129LR2648(01)-111.  Repeals the laws providing for a medical board to review applications for 
2disability retirement;
32.  Provides that the system's hearing officers are not employees of the Board of 
4Trustees of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System but independent contractors 
5that serve as neutral and independent decision makers;
63.  Modifies the definition of "disabled";
74.  Provides that a member seeking disability retirement must obtain a residual 
8functional capacity assessment from a health care provider.  The bill defines "health care 
9provider."  The board may find that a member has a mental or physical disability and is 
10eligible for disability retirement based on the information provided through the 
11assessment.  If the board is unable to determine whether the member is eligible for 
12disability retirement based on the information provided through the assessment, the board 
13must direct the member to have an independent medical examination by an independent 
14health care provider.  After an independent medical review, the board must refer the 
15member's application to a disability specialist, who must, in consultation with the board, 
16make a finding of disability based upon the totality of the evidence.  A final decision of 
17the board that the member is not disabled may be appealed by the member to a hearing 
18officer.  An adverse decision by the hearing officer may be appealed to the court, which 
19must review the matter de novo;
205.  Provides that, beginning with the first full month following the receipt of a 
21residual functional capacity form that states a member is unable to perform essential 
22functions of a job due to a disability that is expected to last at least 12 months, the 
23member must be granted a preapproval benefit calculated at 50% of full disability 
24retirement for 6 months or until a determination of disability is made entitling the 
25member to full disability retirement, whichever comes first.  This preapproval payment 
26may be made upon a disability application only once within a 5-year period;
276.  Provides that, when reviewing medical evidence in making a determination of 
28disability, the board, disability specialists and hearing officers must primarily consider 
29medical opinions in the record and whether the opinions are supported by sound medical 
30evidence and are consistent with other medical evidence in the record; and
317.  Provides that, if a member has retained services of an attorney to represent the 
32member before a hearing officer or in a court proceeding on appeal of a hearing officer's 
33decision and the fee arrangement has been approved by the hearing officer or the court 
34and the attorney obtains a favorable result for the member, the attorney's legal fees must 
35be paid by the board up to a maximum of $12,000.  The attorney may have a contingency 
36fee arrangement, in which case any payment from the board must be applied toward the 
37satisfaction of the contingency fee.
