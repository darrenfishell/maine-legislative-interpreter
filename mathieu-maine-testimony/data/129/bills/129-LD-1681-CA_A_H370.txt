Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill retains the E-9-1-1 surcharge and the pre-paid wireless E-9-1-1 surcharge of 45Â¢ per retail transaction in 
current in law as the maximum amount allowed but authorizes the Public Utilities Commission to set a lower 
surcharge through routine technical rules or other PUC proceedings. The PUC has indicated that current revenues 
from the surcharge are exceeding the intended expenses and that future rulemaking or proceedings may lower the 
surcharge in order to match a lower rate of expenditures.
