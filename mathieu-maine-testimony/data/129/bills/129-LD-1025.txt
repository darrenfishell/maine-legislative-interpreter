7Sec. 37.  Legislative findings; legislative intent.
81.  Legislative findings. The Legislature finds that:
9A. Conversion therapy is a practice or treatment, including but not limited to talk 
10therapy, that seeks or purports to change a person's sexual orientation or gender 
11identity.  It is referred to by several names, including sexual orientation change 
12efforts, reparative therapy and reintegrative therapy;
13B. A wide range of the major health and mental health associations in the United 
14States recognize being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender and having same-sex 
15sexual attractions as normal variants of human sexuality and gender identity, rather 
16than an illness or developmental disorder;
17C. The medical and social science consensus is that conversion therapy is a harmful 
18and ineffective practice or treatment.  Conversion therapy is based on the false 
19premise that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is a mental illness or disorder 
20and is caused by a developmental deficiency, trauma, abuse or unmet emotional 
21needs and that conversion therapy can alter a person's sexual orientation or gender 
22identity;
23D. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting claims that 
24conversion therapy can change an individual's sexual orientation; rather, there is 
25substantial competent and reliable scientific evidence that conversion therapy is 
26ineffective and can and often does result in significant health and safety risks to 
27consumers of those services, including depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, 
28shame, social withdrawal, suicidality and substance abuse, as well as economic 
29losses;
30E. The nation's leading medical and mental health professional organizations, 
31including the American School Counselor Association, the American Psychiatric 
32Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic 
33Association, the American Counseling Association Governing Council, the American 
34Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy 
35of Family Physicians, the National Association of Social Workers and the Pan 
36American Health Organization have concluded that conversion therapy is both 
37ineffective in changing sexual orientation or gender identity and poses safety and 
38health risks; and
39F. The State has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological 
40well-being of minors, including the State's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
Page 7 - 129LR0111(01)-11youth and those youth seeking to examine or understand their sexual orientation or 
2gender identity, from the advertising, offering and administering of conversion 
3therapy and in protecting its minors from the serious health and safety harms that 
4conversion therapy can cause.
52.  Legislative intent.  It is the intent of the Legislature to protect the public health 
6and the safety of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth of the State, and those 
7youth of the State who are seeking to examine or understand their sexual orientation or 
8gender identity, by prohibiting the advertising, offering and administering of therapy 
9designed to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, also known as 
10conversion therapy, to individuals under 18 years of age in the State.
11SUMMARY
12This bill does the following.
131. It defines "conversion therapy" as any practice or course of treatment that seeks or 
14purports to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, except for any 
15practice or treatment that assists an individual undergoing a gender transition; any 
16practice or treatment that provides acceptance, support and understanding to an 
17individual; and any practice or treatment that facilitates an individual's coping, social 
18support or identity exploration and development, including any therapeutic intervention 
19that is neutral with regard to sexual orientation or gender identity, and that seeks to 
20prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices, as long as the counseling 
21does not seek to change the individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.
222.  It prohibits certified school psychologists and guidance counselors, nurses, 
23doctors, physician assistants, psychologists, psychological examiners, alcohol and drug 
24counselors and aides, social workers, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, professional 
25counselors, marriage and family therapists, pastoral counselors, speech-language 
26pathologists and assistants and audiologists from advertising, offering or administering 
27conversion therapy to individuals under 18 years of age.  Advertising, offering or 
28administering conversion therapy to an individual under 18 years of age in violation of 
29this prohibition is grounds for discipline of the professional by the department or board 
30that issued the professional's license, certification or registration, including but not 
31limited to suspension or revocation of the license, certification or registration.
323.  It prohibits MaineCare reimbursement for conversion therapy administered to an 
33individual who is under 18 years of age.
344.  It includes a statement of legislative findings and intent.
