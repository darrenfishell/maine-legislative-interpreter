This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $40,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to a 
newly established Blind and Visually Impaired News Access Fund within the Maine State Library to be used to 
provide access to the National Federation of the Blind's news network for blind and visually impaired persons. The 
allocation is to be funded by transfers by the Public Utilities Commission of $40,000 each year from the Maine 
Universal Service Fund (MUSF) to the newly created fund to support the annual cost of providing access to the 
network. The MUSF currently has sufficient funding to support this transfer and no adjustments to the assessment 
collected from telecommunications providers is required at this time.
