29SUMMARY
30This bill modifies reporting requirements and the Department of Health and Human 
31Services' responsibility for establishment of a plan of safe care to include infants affected 
32by substance use regardless of whether the mother's substance use was legal or illegal.  In 
33addition, this bill clarifies provisions regarding withdrawal symptoms so that the infant is 
34no longer required to demonstrate withdrawal symptoms and instead is required to be 
35affected by withdrawal symptoms.  This bill also changes the requirement for the safe 
36plan of care to require that service referrals be made not just for a mother but for any 
37caregivers of the infant.  These changes reflect changes in the federal Child Abuse 
38Prevention and Treatment Act.
