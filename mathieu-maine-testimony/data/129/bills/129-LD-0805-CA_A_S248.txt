27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. This 
29 amendment combines, clarifies and removes several inconsistencies . in the laws 
30 governing the retail sale and taste testing of Maine-manufactured liquor at farmers' 
31 markets. 
32 As in current law, under the amendment a licensed Maine small brewery, small 
33 winery or small distillery may conduct retail sales or taste-testing events at a farmers' 
34 market subject to the applicable bylaws of the farmers' market. The amendment clarifies 
35 that approval from the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
36 Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations and the municipality where the farmers' 
37 market will be held is required for both retail sales and taste-testing events. The 
38 amendment removes the provision of current law that limits to 2 the number of taste-
39 testing events that may be held by a licensee at a farmers' market each month. 
40 The amendment eliminates the provisions of current law that allow a Maine brewery, 
41 winery or distillery that produces more than 50,000 gallons per year, which is not

authorized under current law to sell its products at a farmers' market, to conduct taste-

4 winery, distillery or small distillery that participates in a taste-testing event under the 
5 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 28-A, section 1052-D to conduct retail sales of malt liquor,
