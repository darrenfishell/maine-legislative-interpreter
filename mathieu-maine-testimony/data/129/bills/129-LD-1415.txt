Page 1 - 129LR1078(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §3028, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 195, is amended to 
3read:
41.  Presumption of abandonment.  It Except as provided by subsection 1-A, it is 
5prima facie evidence that a town or county way not kept passable for the use of motor 
6vehicles at the expense of the municipality or county for a period of 30 or more 
7consecutive years has been discontinued by abandonment.  A presumption of 
8abandonment may be rebutted by evidence that manifests a clear intent by the 
9municipality or county and the public to consider or use the way as if it were a public 
10way.  A proceeding to discontinue a town or county way may not prevent or estop a 
11municipality from asserting a presumption of abandonment.  A municipality or its 
12officials are not liable for nonperformance of a legal duty with respect to such ways if 
13there has been a good faith reliance on a presumption of abandonment.  Any person 
14affected by a presumption of abandonment, including the State or a municipality, may 
15seek declaratory relief to finally resolve the status of such ways.  A way that has been 
16abandoned under this section is relegated to the same status as it would have had after a 
17discontinuance pursuant to section 3026, except that this status retains a public easement 
18and all remaining interests of the municipality pass to the abutting property owners in fee 
19simple to the center of the way.  A way that has been abandoned under this section is at 
20all times subject to an affirmative vote of the legislative body of the municipality within 
21which the way lies making that way an easement for recreational use.  A presumption of 
22abandonment is not rebutted by evidence that shows isolated acts of maintenance, unless 
23other evidence exists that shows a clear intent by the municipality or county to consider 
24or use the way as if it were a public way.
25Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §3028, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
261-A.  Termination through discontinuance process only.  For a town way that does 
27not meet the requirements of subsection 1 as of January 1, 2020, a municipality may 
28terminate in whole or in part any interests held by it for highway purposes only through 
29the discontinuance process pursuant to section 3026-A.  This subsection is not intended to 
30modify common law regarding abandonment of a road.
31Sec. 3.  23 MRSA §3028, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 464, §7, is amended 
32to read:
335.  Filing of record of evidence and determination of abandonment.  If after the 
34effective date of this subsection the municipal officers, either on their own or after being 
35presented with evidence of abandonment, determine that a town way has been 
36discontinued by abandonment pursuant to subsection 1, the municipal officers shall 
37provide in writing the evidence upon which the determination of discontinuation by 
38abandonment was made and the municipal clerk shall file a record of this determination, 
39the evidence upon which the determination was made and the effective date of the 
40determination with the registry of deeds.  The absence of a filing of a determination of 
41discontinuation by abandonment may not be construed as evidence against the status of 
42abandonment.  The registry of deeds shall record a document regarding an abandoned 
Page 2 - 129LR1078(01)-11town way under the name of the town way, the name of the municipality and the names 
2of the abutting property owners.  The municipal clerk shall provide a copy of the 
3document regarding an abandoned town way to the Department of Transportation, Bureau 
4of Maintenance and Operations.
5SUMMARY
6Under current law, a presumption of abandonment exists if a municipality fails for a 
7period of 30 or more years to keep a way passable for the use of motor vehicles at the 
8expense of the municipality. This bill eliminates that presumption for ways that have not 
9met that statutory requirement by January 1, 2020 and instead specifies that the only 
10process that a municipality may use to terminate its interests in a public way is through 
11the discontinuance process established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, section 
123026-A.  This bill also amends the filing required by the clerk of a municipality following 
13the determination of discontinuance by abandonment of a town way to require that the 
14record filed with the registry of deeds include the evidence used by the municipality to 
15make the determination of abandonment and the effective date of that determination of 
16abandonment.
