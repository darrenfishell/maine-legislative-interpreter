32SUMMARY
33This bill amends the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992 to create protections 
34for injured workers whose employers have not secured workers' compensation insurance 
35in accordance with current law.  The bill creates liability for situations when an employee 
36is injured while working for an uninsured subcontractor.  In such situations, the prime 
Page 5 - 129LR1874(01)-11contractor will be responsible for payment of workers' compensation benefits as if it were 
2the direct employer of the injured employee, unless there is an intermediate subcontractor 
3with workers' compensation insurance coverage, in which case, the intermediate 
4subcontractor is responsible for payment of all benefits due under the Act.  These 
5provisions take effect January 1, 2020 and are repealed July 1, 2022.
6The bill also amends the laws governing the Employment Rehabilitation Fund.  Until 
7July 1, 2022, the fund will be used to pay workers' compensation benefits to injured 
8employees working for illegally uninsured employers when there is no other prime 
9contractor or subcontractor liable for payment of benefits.  Until July 1, 2022, the fund 
10will not transfer a portion of its funds to the General Fund and penalties recovered for 
11violations of the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992 will be directed to this fund 
12exclusively, instead of being shared with the Workers' Compensation Board 
13Administrative Fund or the General Fund.
