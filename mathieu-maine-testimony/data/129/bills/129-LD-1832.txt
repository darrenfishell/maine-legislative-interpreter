27On an annual basis, municipalities and publicly owned treatment works whose 
28combined sewer overflows have the potential to affect shellfish harvesting areas as 
29determined by the department by virtue of their locations within estuarine or marine 
30waters of the State must be assessed a surcharge on their wastewater discharge 
31licenses in a total amount of $12,000. This amount must be allocated among the 
32municipalities and publicly owned treatment works according to their prior 3-year 
33average annual flows as reported to the department.
34On an annual basis, publicly owned treatment works whose outfalls licensed for the 
35discharge of treated effluent cause adjacent shellfish growing areas to be closed for 
36the purposes of harvesting shellfish must be assessed a license surcharge in a total 
37amount of $25,000. This amount must be allocated among the publicly owned 
38treatment works according to the acreage that each licensed outfall closes. This 
39acreage must be determined by the Department of Marine Resources in consultation 
40with the department.
