section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, makes the following 
changes to the bill. 
1. It makes technical changes to reflect the emergency enactment of Public Law 
2019, chapter 79 and Public Law 2019, chapter 168. 
2. It moves provisions of current law that authorize the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
Operations to, in special circumstances, set prices on spirits at different levels than those 
established by the State Liquor and Lottery Commission from a section of the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 28-A related to the state tax on spirits to a section of Title 28-A 
related to the administration of the spirits business by the bureau. 
3. It clarifies that an on-premises retail licensee must purchase spirits from an agency 
liquor store that is licensed as a reselling agent. 
4. It removes the provision of the bill authorizing the bureau to offer instant 
redeemable coupons to spirits customers through a publicly accessible website or digital 
media platform. 
5. It expands the list of entities that may benefit from a donation of liquor to be 
auctioned or offered as a prize for fund-raising purposes or sold by a licensed 
on-premises retailer during a fund-raising event to include a county, city, town or 
municipal agency or department. 
6. It allows a licensed on-premises retailer to deliver a serving or drinks containing 
up to 4 1/2 ounces of spirits to a person at one time. 
7. It clarifies the section of the bill that prohibits placing more than 5 signs 
advertising the sale of liquor on the outside of any licensed retail premises. Under the 
amendment, neither a sign in which the only reference to liquor is the name of the 
licensed premises or an image accompanying the name of the licensed premises nor a 
patio umbrella that bears the brand name or image of a liquor product and that is located 
in the outside seating area of a licensed premises counts as one of the 5 permitted signs. 
8. The bill authorizes a broker of spirits, which is defined as a person who represents 
suppliers and manufacturers of spirits, to conduct up to 10 spirits taste-testing events per 
year. The amendment further authorizes a supplier of spirits or a foreign manufacturer of 
spirits, which is defmed as a person who produces spirits outside of the State, to obtain a 
license to conduct up to 10 taste-testing events per year. 
9. It clarifies that revenue from the state tax on spirits must be transferred to the 
Liquor Operation Revenue Fund established in Title 30-A, section 6054 and to the 
General Fund.
