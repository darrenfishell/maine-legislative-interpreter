Fiscal Note 
Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $3,250 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $3,250 in fiscal 
year 2020-21. An estimated $6,190 is available in each of fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 in the Legislature's 
proposed budget for legislative studies as well as any balances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these 
amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council 
and the Legislature. The additional costs of providing staffing assistance to the study during the interim can be 
absorbed utilizing existing budgeted staff resources. The committee is required to seek outside funding contributions 
to fully fund the costs of the study. If sufficient funding is not received within 3 0 days of the effective date of this 
resolve, no meetings are authorized and no expenses may be incurred. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any costs to the Governor's Office or to Maine Revenue Services, within the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services, to provide input to the Committee to Study the Feasibility of Creating Basic Income Security can 
be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
