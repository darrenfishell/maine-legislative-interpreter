10 Clarify the Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits of a Person Who Is Terminated 
11 from Employment for Being Under the Influence of Marijuana" 
12 Amend the bill in section 1 in paragraph A by striking out all of subparagraphs ( 6) 
13 and (7) (page 1, lines 20 to 23 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
14 '(6) Intoxication while on duty or when reporting to work or unauthorized use of

20 SUMMARY 
21 This amendment removes the provision of the bill that includes being under the 
22 influence of marijuana while on duty or when reporting to work, which is the same 
23 provision as using illegal drugs, and instead includes marijuana in the current 
24 disqualification from unemployment benefits for an individual whose employment is 
25 terminated because of intoxication while on duty or when reporting to work or engaging 
26 in unauthorized use of alcohol while on duty.
