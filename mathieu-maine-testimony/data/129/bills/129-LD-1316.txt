Page 1 - 129LR0986(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง1862, sub-ยง14 is enacted to read:
314.  Intertidal land.  Except for discrete filled parcels of intertidal land alienated to 
4adjacent upland owners to facilitate marine commerce, the State retains and holds title to 
5all unfilled intertidal land in the State.
6SUMMARY
7This bill states that the State owns title to intertidal land not already filled to facilitate 
8marine commerce.  The State's ownership is based on federal laws and United States 
9Supreme Court cases that establish and substantiate each state's sovereignty over its 
10intertidal and submerged land, as well as state law, which were not adhered to when the 
11Supreme Judicial Court decided a pre-statehood colonial ordinance applicable to 
12Massachusetts governs the State's ownership interest in intertidal land.
