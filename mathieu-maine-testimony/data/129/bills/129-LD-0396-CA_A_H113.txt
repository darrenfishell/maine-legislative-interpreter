amended to read: 
3. Completed kit. If the alleged victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law 
enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care 
practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport 
and store the completed forensic examination kit for at least 90 days 8 years. The 
completed kit may be identified only by the tracking number. If during that 9-0--aay 
storage period an alleged victim decides to report the alleged offense to a law 
enforcement agency, the alleged victim may contact the hospital or health care

shall provide the alleged victim with the tracking number on the forensic examination kit 
and shall inform the alleged victim which law enforcement agency is storing the kit. 
If the alleged victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time 
the examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic 
examination kit. 
If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the alleged victim does not, within 
60 days, regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the 
alleged offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to storing or 
processing the forensic examination kit. Upon finding good cause and after considering 
factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in processing 
the kit and the likelihood of the alleged victim's regaining a state of consciousness 
adequate to decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a reasonable time, the 
District Court may order either that the kit be stored for additional time or that the kit be 
transported to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing, or such other

Committee: Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
,Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill increases the period of time a law enforcement agency must store a sexual assault forensic examination kit 
from 90 days to 8 years. This change could make evidence available for longer periods of time, potentially increasing 
the number of cases and convictions for sexual assault. However, the number of new cases and convictions is 
expected to be minimal and the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services and the Department of Conections do 
not require additional funding at this time. 
Additional costs to the Department of Public Safety associated with this legislation can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
