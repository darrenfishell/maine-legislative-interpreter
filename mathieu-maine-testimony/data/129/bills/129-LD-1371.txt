11unit of government or the entity to which a local unit of government has assigned 
12responsibility for managing public, educational and governmental access channels.
13Sec. 6.  30-A MRSA §3010, sub-§§5-A, 5-B and 5-C are enacted to read:
145-A.  Public, educational and governmental access channels.  A cable system 
15operator shall carry public, educational and governmental access channels on the cable 
16system operator's basic cable or video service offerings or tiers.  A cable system operator 
17may not separate public, educational and governmental access channels numerically from 
18other local broadcast channels carried on the cable system operator's basic cable or video 
19service offerings or tiers and, in the event of a franchise license transfer, shall use the 
20same channel numbers for the public, educational and governmental access channels as 
21used for those channels by the incumbent cable system operator, unless prohibited by 
22federal law.  After the initial designation of public, educational and governmental access 
23channel numbers, a cable system operator may not change the channel numbers without 
24the agreement of the originator, unless the change is required by federal law.
25A cable system operator shall restore a public, educational or governmental access 
26channel that has been moved without the consent of the originator within the 24 months 
27preceding the effective date of this subsection to its original location and channel number 
28within 60 days after the effective date of this subsection.
295-B.  Transmission.  A cable system operator shall retransmit public, educational 
30and governmental access channel signals in the format in which they are received from 
31the originator and at the same signal quality as that provided to all subscribers of the 
32cable television service for local broadcast channels.  A cable system operator may not 
33diminish, down convert or otherwise tamper with the signal quality or format provided by 
34the originator.  A cable system operator shall deliver a public, educational or 
35governmental access channel signal to the subscriber in a quality and format equivalent to 
36the quality and format of local broadcast channel signals carried on the cable television 
37service if provided as such by the originator.  A cable system operator shall carry each 
38public, educational or governmental access channel in both a high definition format and a 
39standard digital format in the same manner as that in which local broadcast channels are 
40provided, unless prohibited by federal law.
41A cable system operator, when requested, shall assist in providing the originator with 
42access to the entity that controls the cable television service's electronic program guide so 
Page 3 - 129LR0130(01)-11that subscribers may view, select and record public, educational and governmental access 
2channels in the same manner as that in which they view, select and record local broadcast 
3channels.  In addition, a cable system operator shall identify public, educational and 
4governmental access channels on the electronic program guide in the same manner as that 
5in which local broadcast channels are identified.  This subsection does not obligate a 
6cable system operator to list public, educational and governmental access channel content 
7on channel cards and channel listings.  If channels are selected by a viewer through a 
8menu system, the cable system operator shall display the public, educational and 
9governmental access channels' designations in a similar manner as that in which local 
10broadcast channel designations are displayed.
11A cable system operator shall make available to the originator a toll-free telephone 
12number with a direct line to a service technician who is familiar with the signal path and 
13equipment associated with public, educational and governmental access channels on the 
14cable television system for resolution of a signal quality problem.
155-C.  Franchise renewals.  The franchise renewal process must be conducted in 
16compliance with 47 United States Code, Section 546 and this subsection.
17A.  A cable system operator shall maintain adequate personnel and resources to 
18respond to municipal requests for renewal information in a timely manner.  Failure to 
19respond in a timely manner is a violation of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act.
20B.  If an automatic renewal provision exists in a franchise agreement on the effective 
21date of this subsection, the automatic renewal provision remains in effect until that 
22franchise agreement expires.  The cable system operator shall notify the franchising 
23authority of the automatic renewal no later than 36 months in advance of the 
24expiration of the franchise.
25C.  A municipality may require maps, diagrams, annual reports and franchise fee 
26statements at renewal, which the cable system operator shall make available upon 
27reasonable notice.  If information is proprietary, the municipality may execute a 
28nondisclosure agreement with the cable system operator.
29Sec. 7.  Automatic renewal.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
3030-A, section 3010, subsection 5-C, paragraph B, an automatic renewal provision in a 
31franchise agreement in effect between a municipality and a cable system operator on the 
32effective date of this Act remains in effect if the renewal date is less than 36 months after 
33the effective date of this Act.
