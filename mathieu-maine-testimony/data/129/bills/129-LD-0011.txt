Page 1 - 129LR0220(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  21-A MRSA ยง1125, sub-ยง3,  as amended by IB 2015, c. 1, ยง18, is further  
3 amended to read:
4 3.  Qualifying contributions.  Participating  candidates  must obtain qualifying 
5 contributions during the  qualifying period as follows:
6 A.  For a gubernatorial  candidate, at least 3,200 verified registered voters of this State 
7 must support  the candidacy by providing  a qualifying contribution to that candidate;
8 B.  For a candidate  for the State Senate, at least 175 verified registered voters from

13 by providing a qualifying contribution to that candidate.
14 A payment,  gift or anything of value  may not be given in exchange for a qualifying 
15 contribution.  A candidate may pay the fee for a money order that is a qualifying  
16 contribution in the amount  of $5 as long as the donor  making the qualifying contribution  
17 pays the $5 amount  reflected on the money order.  Any money order  fees paid by a 
18 participating candidate must be paid for with seed money and reported in accordance with 
19 commission rules.  A money order  must be signed by the contributor  to be a valid 
20 qualifying contribution.  The commission may establish  by routine technical rule, adopted 
21 in accordance with Title  5, chapter  375, subchapter 2-A, a procedure for a qualifying 
22 contribution to be made by a credit or debit transaction and by electronic  funds transfer 
23 over the Internet.  Qualifying contributions may not be made on a website hosted  or 
24 operated by the commission, the State or a state agency.  Records  containing information 
25 provided by individuals who have made qualifying contributions over the Internet are 
26 confidential, except  for the name of the individual  making the contribution, the date of 
27 the contribution, the individual's  residential  address and the name and office sought of the 
28 candidate in  whose support the contribution was made.
29 It is a violation of this chapter for a participating candidate or an agent of the participating 
30 candidate to misrepresent the purpose of soliciting qualifying contributions and obtaining  
31 the contributor's signed  acknowledgement.
32 Sec. 2.  Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices to 
33 amend rule.  The Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices shall,  
34 prior to the commencement of the next qualifying period as defined  in the Maine Revised 
35 Statutes, Title 21-A, section 1122, subsection 8, amend portions  of section 2 of its rule 
36 Chapter 3: Maine Clean  Election Act and Related Provisions to eliminate the 
37 commission's authority to establish an online service for members of the public to make  
38 qualifying contributions in support of candidates seeking Maine  Clean  Election  Act 
39 funding.
