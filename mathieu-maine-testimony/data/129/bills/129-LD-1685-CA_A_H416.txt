The bill establishes the Foreign Credentialing and Skills Recognition Revolving Loan Program to be administered by 
the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) to provide interest-free loans to eligible immigrants who need assistance 
while awaiting federal employment authorization. The bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $75,000 
per year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to a newly created Foreign Credentialing and Skills Recognition Revolving 
Loan Program Fund within FAME to fund the loan program. The bill also provides that FAME may charge the fund 
up to 5% for it's cost to administer the program. FAME anticipates that this funding will be sufficient to cover its 
administrative costs.
