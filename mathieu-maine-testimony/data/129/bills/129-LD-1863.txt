21SUMMARY
22This bill includes recommendations from the Probate and Trust Law Advisory 
23Commission pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, section 1-803.
24The bill amends Title 18-C, section 3-306 to add language that previously existed in 
25Title 18-A, section 3-306 in order to ensure that heirs, devisees and personal 
26representatives are given notice of the filing of an application for informal probate.
27The bill adds language to Title 18-C, section 3-310 that previously existed in Title 
2818-A, section 3-310 in order to ensure that heirs and devisees are given notice of the 
29filing of an application for informal appointment of a personal representative.  The 
30changes to Title 18-C, section 3-310 parallel the amendment made to Title 18-C, section 
313-306.
32The bill amends Title 18-C, section 3-706, subsection 1 to clarify that the personal 
33representative is required to send a copy of the inventory to all interested persons "who 
34request" the inventory. Both the former counterpart provision under Title 18-A and the 
35counterpart provision under the Uniform Probate Code require the personal representative 
36to furnish the inventory only to persons "who request" the inventory; Title 18-C, section 
373-706, subsection 2 states that "the personal representative shall furnish the inventory to 
38interested persons who request it."
Page 4 - 129LR2814(01)-11The bill amends Title 18-C, section 3-801, subsection 1 to require that notice of the 
2appointment of a personal representative be published to creditors in the county where the 
3decedent was domiciled at the time of death, rather than in the county in which the court 
4that appointed the personal representative is located. When an application for 
5appointment of a personal representative is transferred from the county where the 
6decedent was domiciled to another county before the date of the appointment of the 
7personal representative, notice to creditors by publication in the county to which the 
8application was transferred will be unlikely to be seen by interested persons and creditors.
9The bill amends Title 18-C, section 5-906, subsection 5, which was added to the 
10Maine Uniform Power of Attorney Act with an effective date of September 1, 2019 and 
11which governs the validity of executed powers of attorney, to add language clarifying that 
12the subsection does not affect powers of attorney executed before September 1, 2019. The 
13notices required in powers of attorney by Title 18-C, section 5-905, subsection 2 include 
14references to Title 18-C. The notices required in powers of attorney under Title 18-A, 
15section 5-905, subsection (b) were identical to the notices required by Title 18-C, section 
165-905, subsection 2 with the exception of including references to Title 18-A rather than to 
17Title 18-C. Subsection 5 was added to Title 18-C to protect against the likelihood that 
18attorneys or others preparing powers of attorney might overlook the need to change the 
19notices to reference Title 18-C. 
20The bill amends Title 18-C, section 5-931 to clarify that the authority of an agent 
21under a power of attorney to create or change a beneficiary designation, unless otherwise 
22expressly limited in the power of attorney, includes the authority to create, change or 
23revoke a transfer on death deed. As the Maine Uniform Power of Attorney Act currently 
24reads, there is ambiguity as to whether an agent under a power of attorney has the 
25authority to create, change or revoke a transfer on death deed created under the Uniform 
26Real Property Transfer on Death Act, which became effective on September 1, 2019. 
27Under Title 18-C, section 5-931 of the Maine Uniform Power of Attorney Act, there are 
28several powers that an agent may exercise only if the authority to exercise the powers is 
29expressly granted in the power of attorney. Among those powers is the power to create or 
30change a beneficiary designation. Because a transfer on death deed is a type of 
31beneficiary designation, this bill amends Title 18-C, section 5-931, subsection 1, 
32paragraph D to make it clear that an agent who has the authority to create or change a 
33beneficiary designation also has the authority to create, change or revoke a transfer on 
34death deed.
35The bill amends Title 18-C, section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph A-1 to add a 
36reference to the intestate succession provisions of Title 18-C to avoid any ambiguity as to 
37the timing of the applicability of the intestate succession provisions of Title 18-C.
38The bill amends Title 18-C, section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraphs A, B and C to 
39add language clarifying that the provisions are effective "on or after" the effective date of 
40Title 18-C.
41The bill amends Title 18-C, section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph F to restore the 
42intestate succession involving adoptions completed before the original Probate Code took 
43effect in 1981.  Public Law 2019, chapter 417 erroneously changed the date to September 
441, 2019.  The bill makes the correction retroactive to September 1, 2019.
