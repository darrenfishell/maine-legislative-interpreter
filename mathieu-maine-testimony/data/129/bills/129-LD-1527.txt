4miles per hour or more on a public way with a load of solid precipitation on the motor 
5vehicle.  For the purposes of this subsection, "solid precipitation" includes, but is not 
6limited to, snow, ice, hail and sleet.
7When the load of solid precipitation on a motor vehicle consists of minor amounts, and a 
8reasonable effort has been made to completely remove the load, minor amounts blown 
9from the motor vehicle while in transit do not evidence a violation of this subsection.
10A violation of this subsection is a traffic infraction subject to a fine of not less than $250 
11for the first offense and not less than $500 for a 2nd or subsequent offense.
12This subsection does not apply to commercial trucks.
13SUMMARY
14This bill prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle at a speed of 40 miles per hour or 
15more on a public way with a load of solid precipitation on the motor vehicle.  Failure to 
16clear a motor vehicle is a traffic infraction subject to a $250 fine for a first offense and 
17$500 for a 2nd or subsequent offense.  It exempts commercial trucks from the provision.
