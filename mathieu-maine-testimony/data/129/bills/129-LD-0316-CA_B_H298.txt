27 "dependent adult" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 3472, subsection 6 and 
28 "incapacitated adult" in Title 22, section 3472, subsection 10. The amendment elevates 
29 the class of the following crimes of theft or fraud by one class, up to a maximum of Class 
30 B, if the owner of the property is a vulnerable person: theft by unauthorized taking or 
31 transfer, theft by deception, theft by misapplication of prope1iy and misuse of entrusted 
32 property.

This bill would raise the class of various theft crimes by one class, up to a maximum of Class B, if the victim is a 
vuln~rable person. Cunently, theft from a vulnerable person could range from a Class E to a Class B crime, depending 
on the circumstances of the case. 
In 2018 the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services handled about 3 ,400 cases under the theft crime sections 
changed in this bill that were not already charged as Class B crimes. Of these, about half were class E crimes. The 
commission does not face increased costs from a crime moving from a Class E to a Class D. However, the average 
incremental cost of one case moving from a Class D to a Class C or from a Class C to a Class B is $400. Assuming 
that 2%-5% of the relevant non-Class E cases are committed against a vulnerable person, it is estimated that 34 to 85 
cases could face an elevation in the class of the crime. This would represent increased costs to the commission of 
$13,600 to $34,000, or an average of $23,800 per year. The bill provides $17,850 to the commission in fiscal year 
2019-20 and $23,800 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
In addition, the Maine Department of Conections (DOC) will face increased costs due to more incarcerated 
individuals and individuals incarcerated for longer periods of time. It is unclear how many individuals would be 
convicted of an elevated class of crime as a result of this bill. The incremental difference to the DOC of increasing a 
Class C crime to a Class Bis $27,506 per sentence. The incremental cost of increasing from a Class D to a Class C is 
$44, 106. The DOC has not indicated the need for additional funding at this time and no funding is included in the bill 
for the DOC. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed does not require additional funding at 
this time for the courts. The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by 
minor amounts.
