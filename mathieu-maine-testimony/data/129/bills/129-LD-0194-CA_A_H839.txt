9COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to H.P. 157, L.D. 194, Bill, “An Act To Allow 
10the Reduction of a MaineCare Lien”
11Amend the bill in section 1 in subsection 1 by striking out all of the last blocked 
12paragraph (page 1, lines 30 to 44 and page 2, lines 1 to 4 in L.D.) and inserting the 
13following:
14'The commissioner's right to recover the cost of benefits provided constitutes a statutory 
15lien on the proceeds of an award or settlement from a 3rd party if recovery for MaineCare 
16costs was or could have been included in the recipient's claim for damages from the 3rd 
17party to the extent of the recovery for medical expenses.  The commissioner is entitled to 
18recover the cost of the benefits actually paid out when the commissioner has determined 
19that collection will be cost-effective to the extent that there are proceeds available for 
20such recovery after the deduction of reasonable attorney's fees and litigation costs from 
21the gross award or settlement from that portion of the award or settlement attributable to 
22past medical expenses paid by MaineCare after the pro rata deduction of reasonable 
23attorney's fees and litigation costs.  In determining whether collection will be cost-
24effective, the commissioner shall consider all factors that diminish potential recovery by 
25the department, The portion of the award or settlement attributable to past medical 
26expenses paid by MaineCare must be apportioned taking into consideration the full value 
27of the recipient’s claim and the fraction by which it has been reduced due to factors 
28including but not limited to questions of liability and comparative negligence or other 
29legal defenses, exigencies of trial that reduce a settlement or award in order to resolve the 
30recipient's claim and limits on the amount of applicable insurance coverage that reduce 
31the claim to the amount recoverable by the recipient.  The department's statutory lien may 
32not be reduced to reflect an assessment of a pro rata share of the recipient's attorney's fees 
33or litigation costs. If an award is established by a court judgment, and the judgment 
34allocates the portion of the award attributable to past medical expenses, that allocation is 
35binding.  If the commissioner and a recipient are unable to agree on an allocation of the 
36amount of recovery attributable to past medical expenses paid by MaineCare, either party 
37may submit the matter to a court for a determination of the allocation.  The commissioner 
38may, at the commissioner's discretion, compromise, or otherwise settle and execute a Date: (Filing No. H-          )

Fiscal Detail and Notes
The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Departme nt of Health and Human Services of $544,200 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 due to the elimination of the prohibition on reduc ing the statutory lien to reflect an assessment of the 
recipient's attorney's fees or litigation costs. Federal E xpenditures Fund allocations are also included for the FMAP 
match.
The amendment also changes statute to state that the Ma ineCare lien can only apply to the portion of the award or 
settlement that is attributable to medical expenses paid by MaineCare. This limitation is already the law based on two 
Supreme Court decisions, Arkansas v.  Ahlborn, 547 U.S. 268 (2006) and Wo s v. E.M.A, 568 U.S. 627 (2013), so 
there is no fiscal impact associated with this change.Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
