The amendment eliminates the requirement for the Legislature to contract with the University of Maine System to 
establish and maintain the Maine Workforce, Research, Development and Student Achievement Institute and 
eliminates the $250,390 ongoing appropriation for this contract and for other costs to the Legislature. The additional 
costs to the Legislature for a legislator to serve on the Maine Workforce, Research, Development and Student 
Achievement Institute Steering Committee are assumed to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
