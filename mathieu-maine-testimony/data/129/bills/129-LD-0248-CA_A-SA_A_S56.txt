14 SUMMARY 
15 This amendment amends Committee Amendment 11A11 to: 
16 1. Increase the reimbursement to the dealer or local redemption center for the cost of 
17 handling beverage containers by 1/2¢ beginning January 1, 2020; 
18 2. Eliminates a provision reducing by 1/2¢ the reimbursement to the dealer or local

22 Department of Environmental Protection of redemption center licenses to redemption 
23 centers not licensed prior to May 1, 2019 unless the department determines that a new 
24 redemption center is needed to serve an area in which an existing redemption center 
25 ceases to operate. This licensing prohibition does not apply to renewal of redemption 
26 center licenses issued prior to May 1, 2019; and

28 deposit that has entered into a commingling agreement, and its contracted agent, if any, to

30 picked up from each redemption center on each pick-up date in calendar year 2018.

This amendment eliminates the May 1, 2019 one-half cent increase in handling reimbursement in the committee 
amendment, but keeps the January 1, 2020 increase. This change is offset by a new provision beginning May 1, 2019 
that removes from existing law a reduction of one-half cent in the reimbursement paid if the container is subject to a 
commingling agreement. Taken together these two changes completely offset each other and there is no net fiscal 
effect from eliminating the May 1, 2019 handling reimbursement increase and eliminating the commingling discount 
on the same date. 
This amendment also prohibits the issuance by the Department of Enviromnental Protection (DEP) of new 
redemption center licenses after May 1, 2019 until January 15, 2020, while allowing currently licensed redemption 
centers to renew licenses. This prohibition will result in a minor Other Special Revenue Funds revenue loss for the 
department. The amendment also directs the DEP to require the submission of additional infonnation from initiators 
of deposit regarding their activities in the beverage container redemption program. Any additional costs to BABLO 
as an initiator of deposit or the DEP as a result of this requirement are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budget resources. 
This amendment also adjusts the allocations in the committee amendment to better reflect the timing of 
implementation. These adjustments are not related to the provisions of this amendment.
