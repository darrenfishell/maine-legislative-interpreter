Page 1 - 129LR1114(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง439-A, sub-ยง4-D is enacted to read:
34-D.  Exemption from setback requirements for pedestrian walkways and trails.  
4In accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a municipality may adopt an 
5ordinance that exempts pedestrian walkways and trails from the water and wetland 
6setback requirements otherwise applicable under this section.
7A.  Notwithstanding subsection 4, a municipality may adopt an ordinance pursuant to 
8this subsection that exempts a pedestrian walkway or trail from the otherwise 
9applicable water or wetland setbacks if the following requirements are met:
10(1)  Use of motorized vehicles is prohibited on all positions of the pedestrian 
11walkway or trail that are located within the shoreland zone as established by 
12section 435, except that use of a motorized wheelchair, motorized scooter or 
13similar motorized assistive device by a person with a disability that prevents the 
14person from using a walkway or trail without a motorized assistive device may be 
15allowed.  Use of nonmotorized vehicles, including, but not limited to, bicycles, 
16may be allowed;
17(2)  If cantilevered over a water body or wetland within the shoreland zone as 
18established by section 435, the pedestrian walkway or trail does not extend over 
19the water body or wetland more than 10 feet from the normal high-water line;
20(3)  If cantilevered over a water body or wetland within the shoreland zone as 
21established by section 435, the pedestrian walkway or trail is attached to a 
22structure that was constructed prior to 1971 and that is located within the 
23shoreland zone;
24(4)  If the walkway or trail is cantilevered over a water body or wetland within 
25the shoreland zone as established by section 435, the municipal planning board 
26has determined there is no other practical means to construct the pedestrian 
27walkway or trail without cantilevering over that segment of the water body or 
28wetland.  If there are no other practical means to construct the pedestrian 
29walkway or trail, approaches to the cantilevered walkway or trail may also 
30cantilever off adjacent retaining walls but no more than is necessary to access the 
31cantilevered walkway or trail;
32(5)  The pedestrian walkway or trail is not located within a shoreland area zoned 
33for resource protection;
34(6)  The pedestrian walkway or trail is located within a shoreland area that has 
35previously been developed or, if located within a shoreland area that has not 
36previously been developed, the walkway or trail is set back at least 25 feet from 
37the normal high-water line of the water body or wetland;
38(7)  The pedestrian walkway or trail is constructed by a contractor certified in 
39erosion control pursuant to section 439-B; and
40(8)  The pedestrian walkway or trail is owned and maintained either publicly or 
41as a public-private partnership.
Page 2 - 129LR1114(01)-11B.  Except for the water and wetland setback requirements in subsection 4, a 
2pedestrian walkway or trail that meets the requirements of this subsection must meet 
3all other state and local permit requirements and comply with all other applicable 
4rules.
5SUMMARY
6This bill amends the shoreland zoning laws to authorize a municipality to adopt an 
7ordinance that exempts pedestrian walkways or trails within the shoreland zone from 
8otherwise applicable setback requirements so long as use of motorized vehicles, other 
9than motorized assistive devices, is prohibited on the walkway or trail and the ordinance 
10maintains certain other protective standards.  Any allowed walkway or trail must meet all 
11other state and local permit requirements and comply with all other applicable rules.
