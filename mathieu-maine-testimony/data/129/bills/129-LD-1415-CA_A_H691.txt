21 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or

23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment strikes the bill. Effective October 1, 2020, it repeals the current 
25 statute on the abandonment of town ways and enacts a new abandonment process in 
26 statute that a municipality may choose to follow to declare a town way abandoned. The 
27 optional process includes notice provisions to abutting property owners, prope1ty owners 
28 for whom the town way is the only means of access and adjacent municipalities and 
29 counties. The optional process provides for a public hearing process and an appeals 
30 process. The amendment clarifies that the public easement retained in a town way 
31 discontinued by abandonment is limited to rights of access by foot or motor vehicle, 
32 which are the limits of public easements laid out by a municipality through its eminent 
33 domain powers in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 3022. 
34 The fiscal note on this amendment identifies a requirement in the amendment as a 
35 potential state mandate with a moderate statewide cost. The committee finds that the 
36 provisions identified as a potential mandate do not require a local unit of government to 
37 expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local 
38 revenue. fu order to be a mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, 
39 Section 21, a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or modify its 
40 activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue.

1 The requirements in this amendment that a municipality or county provide notice and 
2 the opportunity for hearing if the municipality or county takes the step of declaring a 
3 town way abandoned does not require an expansion or modification of activities because 
4 there is no requirement that a municipality or county abandon a town way or declare a 
5 town way abandoned. Additionally, a municipality or county that chooses to abandon a 
6 town way may do so under the common law presumption of abandonment recognized by 
7 the Maine Supreme Judicial Court since 1916.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.
