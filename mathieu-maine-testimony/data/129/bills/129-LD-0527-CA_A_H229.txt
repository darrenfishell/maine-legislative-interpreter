This resolve directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, (ACF) Bureau of Parks and Lands to 
implement a training program for bureau employees and agents who manage lands or waters and exercise law 
enforcement powers within the bureau's jurisdiction on various law enforcement practices, to be implemented no 
later than January 1, 2020. 
This resolve includes appropriations of $42,597 in fiscal year 2019-20 and fiscal year 2020-21 to the ACF for 
contracted trainers, training materials, lodging and meals. The ACF has estimated that 50 employees will take the 
training course and that due to staffing constraints half would complete the training program in fiscal year 2019-20 
and half in fiscal year 2020-21. The ACF estimates that due to employee turnover in future years approximately 21 
employees a year will be required to complete the training.
