Changes to the definition of "something of value'' will eliminate the need for organizations to seek a license when 
allowing the casual play of games of chance that does not involve gambling. The effect of these changes in future 
fiscal years will be fewer organizations seeking a license. As a result, license revenue to the Gambling Control Unit 
within the Department of Public Safety will decrease by $1,395 in fiscal year 2019-20 and by $1,860 annually 
beginning in fiscal year 2020-21.
