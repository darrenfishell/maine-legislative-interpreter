2This resolve requires the county commissioners of Hancock and Washington counties 
3to submit a referendum question to the voters at the statewide election in November 2020.   
4The referendum question is whether the voters of each county desire to direct the county 
5commissioners to dissolve Prosecutorial District Number 7 and develop a plan to either 
6establish a separate prosecutorial district or join a neighboring prosecutorial district.  If a 
7majority of voters in both counties vote in favor of this referendum question, the county 
8commissioners of both counties are directed to develop and submit a plan to the joint 
9standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over state and local government 
10matters by February 1, 2021.  If the county commissioners plan to join a neighboring 
11prosecutorial district, the county commissioners of that neighboring district are required 
12to submit a report to the committee stating their consent to the addition.  The committee 
13is directed to introduce legislation in the First or Second Regular Session of the 130th 
14Legislature that implements the plans of the counties.  The plans and the dissolution of 
15Prosecutorial District Number 7 take effect January 1, 2023.
