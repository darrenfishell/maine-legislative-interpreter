13 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
14 section number to read consecutively. 
15 SUMMARY 
16 This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, replaces the bill. 
17 Current law requires every physician, midwife or nurse in charge to instill or cause to be 
18 instilled into the eyes of an infant within 24 hours after the infant's birth prophylactic eye 
19 drops, except for an infant whose parents object to this procedure on the grounds that it 
20 conflicts with their religious tenets and practices. This amendment updates the term "eye 
21 drops" to "ophthalmic ointment" to reflect current practice, removes the civil penalties for 
22 noncompliance and removes the exemption based on religious tenets and practices. 
23 This amendment also requires every physician, midwife or nurse in charge at the 
24 birth of an infant to administer vitamin K to an infant intramuscularly to prevent vitamin 
25 K deficiency bleeding in infants within 6 hours after the infant's birth. 
26 It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules to implement 
27 this section, including, but not limited to, creating and making publicly available a 
28 brochure about the medical benefits and risks of administering the prophylactic 
29 ophthalmic ointment and vitamin K injection and providing a form on which a parent can 
30 refuse the prophylactic ophthalmic ointment and vitamin K injection for the infant of that 
31 parent. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its 
32 newborn blood spot screening refusal form to include a section permitting a parent to 
33 refuse the prophylactic ophthalmic ointment and vitamin K injection for the infant of that 
34 parent.
