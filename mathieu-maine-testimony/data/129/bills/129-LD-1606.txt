41.  Career and technical education program components.  Beginning in fiscal year

7that have been approved by the department pursuant to chapter 313 for:
8A.  Direct instruction.  The direct instruction component includes personnel costs for 
9teachers, education technicians for programs and clinical supervisors for health care 
10programs.  The allocation for direct instruction is the sum of the costs as determined 
11based on the following components, which the commissioner shall determine 
12annually:
13(1)  A teacher salary matrix.  In determining the teacher salary matrix for each 
14program, the commissioner shall give consideration to the most recent available 
15data regarding years of education experience and years of professional work 
16experience relevant to instructional assignment;
17(2)  Student-to-teacher ratios for each program;
18(3)  The number of education technicians required for purposes of instructional 
19support, based on student enrollment and program requirements.  The 
20commissioner shall calculate the education technician allocation by multiplying 
21the number of education technicians required by the statewide average salary for 
22full-time education technicians, based on the most recent available salary data, 
23but shall ensure that each career and technical education center or career and 
24technical education region is allocated at least one full-time education technician; 
25and
26(4)  The clinical supervision staffing level necessary for each program requiring 
27such staffing, based on student enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph 
28G;
29B.  Central administration.  The central administration component includes personnel 
30costs for directors, assistant directors and clerical staff working in career and 
31technical education centers and career and technical education regions, as well as 
32business managers working in career and technical education regions.  The central 
33administration allocation is the sum of:
34(1)  Costs for personnel for each career and technical education center and career 
35and technical education region, as follows:
36(a)  A director, the allocation for which must be for one full-time equivalent;
37(b)  An assistant director, the allocation for which must be based on student 
38enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph G but may not exceed one 
39full-time equivalent;
Page 2 - 129LR2440(01)-11(c)  Clerical staff, the allocation for which must be for at least one full-time 
2equivalent, with additional clerical staff allocations based on student 
3enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph G;
4(d)  A career and technical education region business manager, the allocation 
5for which must be for one full-time equivalent; and
6(e)  Benefit costs for employees in central administration, which must be 
7calculated pursuant to section 15678, subsection 5, paragraph B; and
8(2)  Nonpersonnel costs, which the commissioner shall calculate annually based 
9upon the relationship of the most recent available career and technical education 
10expenditures for nonpersonnel costs to personnel costs;
11C.  Supplies and other expenditures such as purchased services, dues and fees for 
12instructional programs.  The allocation for supplies and other expenditures is the sum 
13of:
14(1)  A per-program allocation for supplies, as determined by the commissioner 
15based on the most recent available career and technical education expenditures 
16amount, adjusted to the year prior to the allocation year; and
17(2)  A per-pupil allocation for each student in each career and technical education 
18center and each career and technical education region, determined by the 
19commissioner based on:
20(a)  The most recent available career and technical education expenditures 
21amount, adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year; and
22(b)  Student enrollment, as determined pursuant to paragraph G;
23D.  Plant operation and maintenance, including all costs for operating and 
24maintaining buildings and grounds.  The commissioner shall determine the allocation 
25for plant operation and maintenance costs for each career and technical education 
26center and each career and technical education region by multiplying the square 
27footage of the career and technical education center or career and technical education 
28region building by an amount per square foot, as determined by the commissioner;

Page 3 - 129LR2440(01)-11(4)  Instructional technology, staff professional development, student assessment 
2and program safety.  The commissioner shall calculate a per-pupil allocation for 
3this allocation based upon student enrollment, as determined pursuant to 
4paragraph G, and the relationship of the most recent available career and

6prior to the allocation year;

11of the attending student counts on October 1st for that program or plan.
12(2)  For each program or plan approved pursuant to chapter 313 that is not 
13governed by subparagraph (1), including a new program or plan approved 
14pursuant to chapter 313, student enrollment must be based on the estimated 
15attending student count submitted in accordance with the application for the 
16program or plan approval.  This estimated attending student count must be used 
17until the program or plan has 3 consecutive years of actual attending student 
18counts on October 1st.
19The total allocation for a career and technical education center or career and technical 
20education region is the sum of the components in paragraphs A to E, except if the sum of 
21the components in paragraphs A to E is less than the most recent expenditure data, as 
22adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year, the career and technical 
23education center or career and technical education region may not receive less than the 
24adjusted expenditure, and if the sum of the components in paragraphs A to E is more than 
255% greater than the most recent expenditure data, as adjusted for inflation to the year 
26prior to the allocation year, then the career and technical education center or career and 
27technical education region may not receive more than the adjusted expenditures plus 5%.
28The commissioner shall authorize monthly payment of allocations to career and technical 
29education centers and career and technical education regions in an amount equal to 1/12 
30of the total allocation.  Payments for satellite programs as approved pursuant to chapter 
31313 must be made within this schedule to the responsible career and technical education 
32center or career and technical education region; it is the responsibility of the career and 
33technical education center or career and technical education region to provide the state 
34support for the approved satellite program to the school administrative unit that operates 
35the approved satellite program.
36If a school administrative unit operating a career and technical education center or career

38these funds must be carried forward for the purposes of career and technical education.
