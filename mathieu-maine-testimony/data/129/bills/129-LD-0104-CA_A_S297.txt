1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is the majority report, replaces the provisions of the bill 
3 amending the earned income tax credit with the Maine work credit. The Maine work 
4 credit is similar to the federal earned income tax credit but uses different factors for 
5 calculating the credit that are intended to produce a state credit for individuals with 
6 qualifying children that is approximately 23% of the federal credit and for individuals 
7 with no qualifying children that is approximately 70% of the federal credit. The bill also 
8 provides eligibility for individuals who are at least 18 years of age but less than 25 years 
9 of age who have no qualifying children and creates a minimum credit for students and 
10 eligible caregivers. 
11 The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
