9SUMMARY
10This bill requires the Commissioner of Corrections to enter into agreements with 
11other state agencies to ensure that prisoners and juvenile clients receive coordinated 
12assistance with reentry and receive services and benefits upon release into the 
13community.  It also authorizes the commissioner to enter into similar agreements with 
14federal agencies and community agencies.
15Under current law, the amount of time a prisoner must serve prior to being transferred 
16to supervised community confinement is based on the term of imprisonment.  The bill 
17removes that distinction.
18The bill removes a provision of law providing that if the commissioner determines 
19that the average statewide probation case load is no more than 90 probationers to one 
20probation officer, a prisoner may be transferred to supervised community confinement if 
21the prisoner has no more than 2 years remaining on the term of imprisonment or 
22unsuspended portion of a split sentence.
23Under current law, the commissioner may transfer any client from one correctional or 
24detention facility or program to another.  The bill adds sober houses, transitional housing 
25and reentry programs to the list of such facilities in current law.
