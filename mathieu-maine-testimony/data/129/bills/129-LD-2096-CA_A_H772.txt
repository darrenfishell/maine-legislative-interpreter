Minor cost increase -All funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill provides that a health insurance carrier may not impose a cost-shating requirement in excess of $35 for 
insulin drugs for a 30 day supply. The Maine State Employee Health Plan has indicated that it does not anticipate a 
significant increase in costs as a result of this cost-sharing limit given the amounts that are cunently charged. Any 
costs, which are expected to be minor, would likely be reflected through increased premium amounts in future fiscal 
years. 
Additional costs to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation and the Maine Board of Phannacy 
associated with the rulemaking process can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
