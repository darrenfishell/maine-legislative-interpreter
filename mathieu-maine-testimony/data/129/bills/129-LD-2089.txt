32SUMMARY
33This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal 
34Affairs pursuant to Resolve 2019, chapter 15.  The committee has not taken a position on 
35the substance of the bill and by reporting this bill out the committee is not suggesting and 
36does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with any aspect of this bill. The 
Page 3 - 129LR3173(01)-11committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of obtaining a printed bill that can 
2be referred to the committee for a public hearing and subsequent committee action in the 
3normal course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in 
4the legislative review of the proposal.
5This bill resolves an inconsistency in the State's liquor laws by clarifying that an out-
6of-state spirits supplier must obtain a certificate of approval from the Department of 
7Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
8Operations before it may transport spirits into the State for sale to the bureau or cause 
9spirits to be transported into the State for sale to the bureau. The out-of-state spirits 
10suppliers who must obtain a certificate of approval under the bill include both out-of-state 
11spirits manufacturers and persons who engage in the out-of-state purchase of spirits for 
12resale to the bureau.
13The bill also clarifies which of the existing laws applicable to certificate of approval 
14holders apply to out-of-state spirits suppliers, who are included in the definition of 
15"certificate of approval holder" under the bill.  For example, the bill exempts out-of-state 
16spirits suppliers from the statutory requirement that certificate of approval holders enter 
17into a distribution contract with a wholesaler who is licensed to sell malt liquor or wine 
18within the State.  These contracts are unnecessary because, under existing law, all spirits 
19products must be sold to the bureau, which contracts with the entity that provides 
20warehousing and distribution services for spirits products within the State.
