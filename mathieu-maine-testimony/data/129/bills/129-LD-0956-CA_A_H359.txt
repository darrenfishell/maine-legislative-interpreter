Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill allows the holder of a student lobster and crab fishing license who has been issued trap tags to fish in the 
Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area (MLCA) during the closed season if that closed season occurs during an 
interim between school years. The bill also specifies that the age of the licensee determines the number of trap tags 
issued to student lobster and crab fishing licensees who fish in the MLCA. Due to the limited number of student 
lobster and crab fishing licensees who fish in the MLCA, any additional costs to the Department of Marine 
Resources to implement the provisions of this bill are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
