Project labor agreements allowed for public works projects 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill allows public authorities to enter into project labor agreements for public works projects but does not require 
them to do so. Although such agreements could increase the cost of projects, making them optional means a public 
authority would be free to weigh the benefits and costs on its own.
