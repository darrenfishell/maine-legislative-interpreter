Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill repeals current statute that includes a $2 per ton municipal solid waste surcharge and certain exemptions to 
that surcharge.  The bill changes the cu rrent $1 per ton solid waste disposal fee to include all municipal solid waste or 
municipal solid waste ash.  The loss of revenue from the remo val of the surcharge will be offset by an increase in the 
number of tons subject to the fee.  The net impact of th ese changes is estimated to be an ongoing annual revenue 
increase of $55,000, prorated to $27, 500 in fiscal year 2020-21, to the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund 
(MSWMF) within the Department of Environmental Protec tion. The bill includes an accompanying increase in the 
allocation to the MSWMF for expenditure of the additional revenue.   Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
