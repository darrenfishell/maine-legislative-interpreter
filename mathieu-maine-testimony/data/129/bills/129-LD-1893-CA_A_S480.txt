Fiscal Detail and Notes
Any additional costs to the Legislature for "the vote of 2/ 3 of all the members elected to each House" are assumed to 
be absorbed within exiting budgeted resources.This bill directs the Department of Agriculture, Conserva tion and Forestry (ACF) to terminate the existing lease 
agreement with Central Maine Power Company related to a cer tain portion of public reserved lands and to renegotiate 
a new lease more favorable to the State. At the time this bill was introduced in December of 2019, the ACF was 
receiving less than $4,000 annually from this lease. In June  of 2020 the lease agreement between the ACF and Central 
Maine Power Company was renegotiated independently of this  bill. Under the terms of the new lease agreement, ACF 
will receive $65,000 annually. Passage of this resolve will require the new lease be terminated and subsequently renegotiated. No estimate is made at this time on the amount  of any costs incurred or revenue gained by a new round 
of negotiation of the lease in question.   Fiscal Note
