2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง701-A, as amended by PL 2007, c. 389, ยง1, is further amended 
3to read:
4ยง701-A.  Just value defined
5In the assessment of property, assessors in determining just value are to define this 
6term in a manner that recognizes only that value arising from presently possible land use 
7alternatives to which the particular parcel of land being valued may be put. In 
8determining just value, assessors must consider all relevant factors, including without 
9limitation the effect upon value of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the 
10land may be subjected including the effect on value of designation of land as significant 
11wildlife habitat under Title 38, section 480-BB, current use, physical depreciation, sales 
12in the secondary market, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. 
13Restrictions include but are not limited to zoning restrictions limiting the use of land, 
14subdivision restrictions and any recorded contractual provisions limiting the use of lands. 
15The just value of land is determined to arise from and is attributable to legally permissible 
16use or uses only.
17For the purpose of establishing the valuation of unimproved acreage in excess of an 
18improved house lot, contiguous parcels and parcels divided by road, powerline or right-
19of-way may be valued as one parcel when:  each parcel is 5 or more acres; the owner 
20gives written consent to the assessor to value the parcels as one parcel; and the owner 
21certifies that the parcels are not held for sale and are not subdivision lots.
22For the purpose of establishing the valuation of a retail sales facility, as defined in 
23section 6651, subsection 5, in excess of 20,000 square feet, the property must be valued 
24based on its current use or, if the property is vacant, at its highest and best use.  In 
25establishing the valuation, assessors shall consider:
261.  Highest and best use.  Sales and rentals of properties exhibiting the same or a 
27similar highest and best use, taking into consideration the pool of potential buyers and 
28sellers that typically buy or sell properties similar to the property being valued, including 
29potential buyers who are investors or owner-occupants; and
302.  Similar properties.  Sales and rentals of properties that are similar to the property 
31being valued with regard to age, condition, use, type of construction, location, design, 
32physical features and economic characteristics.
33SUMMARY
34This bill provides that, for property tax purposes, retail sales facilities in excess of 
3520,000 square feet must be valued based on their current use compared to similar 
36properties in their retail market segment or, if vacant, according to their highest and best 
37use.
