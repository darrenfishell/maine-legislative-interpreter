This bill allows the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW) to issue the holder of a registration certificate 
and a set of gold star family registration plates a complimentary license to hunt, trap and fish including permits, 
stamps and other pennissions needed to hunt. The IFW estimates that 75 gold star plate holders have purchased 
hunting, fishing or trapping licenses in the past. If all 7 5 choose to apply for a complimentary license, General Fund 
revenue would decrease by $3,225 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20.
