from viewing the information. Upon such a request, the authority shall ensure that the 
information provided is viewed only by those members of the authority and staff who do 
not stand to gain a competitive advantage and that there are adequate safeguards to 
protect that information from members of the authority who could gain a competitive 
advantage from viewing the information.
