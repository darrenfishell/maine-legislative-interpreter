Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
1. It clarifies that employment earnings in the months when earnings are subject to 
disregards do not affect special housing allowances. 
2. It reduces the number of months that the Department of Health and Human 
Services disregards the earnings of a recipient of temporary assistance for needy families, 
or TANF, benefits and removes the requirement that the earnings be continuous for more 
than 2 months to be counted. 
3. It stipulates that a month in which earnings are insufficient to change a benefit 
amount is not counted as a month in which earnings are disregarded. 
4. It changes the requirement for food supplement assistance for a TANF recipient to 
be the same amount as prior to employment to a minimum of $50 in food supplement 
assistance. 
5. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to approve an extension 
from the 60-month limit for TANF recipients who have employment earnings that are 
subject to disregards rather than not counting those months in the 60-month limit. 
6. It changes the amount of TANF block grant funds that can be used for initiatives 
in the bill from $3,000,000 to $2,000,000. 
7. It corrects the language for basic skills education to refer to a high school diploma 
or equivalent or comparable credential. It also states that basic skills education counting 
as work participation requirements may be suspended if the State no longer meets the 
work participation rates required by the Federal Government. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
