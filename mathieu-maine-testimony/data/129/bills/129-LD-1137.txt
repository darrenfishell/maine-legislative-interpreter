17This bill removes the requirement that the Department of Health and Human 
18Services, Background Check Center be used to screen prospective employees of child 
19care facilities and family child care providers.  Instead, this bill allows the criminal 
20background check used for new and continuing school employees to fulfill the state and 
21federal requirements for a mandatory criminal background check for a person who 
22provides child care in a child care facility, a family child care provider and a person who 
23provides day care in that person's home for one or 2 children whose care is paid for by 
24state or federal funds.
