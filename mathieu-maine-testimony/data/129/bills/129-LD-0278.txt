Page 1 - 129LR0084(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  5 MRSA  §4572, sub-§1, ¶A, as amended by PL 2005, c. 10, §11, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 A.  For any employer to fail or refuse  to hire or otherwise  discriminate against any 
5 applicant for employment  because of race or color, sex, sexual  orientation, physical 
6 or mental disability, religion, age, ancestry or national origin, because  of the 
7 applicant's previous assertion of a claim or right under former Title  39 or Title 39-A 
8 or because of previous actions taken by the applicant that are protected under Title  
9 26, chapter 7, subchapter 5-B; or, because of those  reasons, to discharge an employee 
10 or discriminate with respect to hire, tenure,  promotion, transfer, compensation, terms, 
11 conditions or privileges  of employment or any other matter directly or indirectly 
12 related to employment; or, in recruiting of individuals for employment or in hiring  
13 them, to utilize any employment agency that the employer knows or has reasonable 
14 cause to know  discriminates against individuals because of their race or color,  sex, 
15 sexual orientation, physical  or mental disability, religion, age, ancestry or national  
16 origin, because  of their previous assertion  of a claim  or right under former  Title 39 or 
17 Title 39-A  or because of previous actions that are protected under Title 26, chapter  7, 
18 subchapter 5- B;.
19 (1)  This paragraph does not apply to discrimination governed by Title  39-A, 
20 section 353; and
21 (2)  Evidence of discrimination  with respect to compensation includes, but is not 
22 limited to:
23 (a)  An employer, either directly or indirectly through an employment agency 
24 working on behalf of the employer,  inquiring about or seeking the wage 
25 history of a prospective  employee from the prospective employee or a current 
26 or former employer or requiring that a prospective employee's prior wage  
27 history meet certain criteria unless an offer of employment that includes all 
28 terms of compensation has been negotiated and made  to the prospective 
29 employee, after which  the employer  or employment agency may inquire  
30 about or confirm the prospective  employee's wage  history.  If a prospective 
31 employee has voluntarily  disclosed  wage history information, without 
32 prompting by the employer or employment agency, the employer or 
33 employment agency may seek to confirm or permit a prospective employee 
34 to confirm such information prior to an offer of  employment; or
35 (b)  An employer  prohibiting  an employee from  disclosing the employee's 
36 own wages or from inquiring about or disclosing another  employee's wages;
37 Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §628, first ¶, as amended  by PL 2009, c. 29, §1, is further 
38 amended to read:
39 An employer may not discriminate between  employees in the same  establishment on 
40 the basis of sex by paying wages  to any employee in any occupation  in this State  at a rate 
41 less than the rate at which the employer  pays any employee of the opposite sex for 
42 comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements relating to skill, effort and 
Page 2 - 129LR0084(01)-11 responsibility.  Differentials that are paid pursuant to established  seniority systems or 
2 merit increase systems or difference in the shift or time of the day worked that do not 
3 discriminate on the basis of sex are not within this prohibition.  An employer may not 
4 discharge or discriminate against any employee by reason of any action  taken  by such 
5 employee to invoke  or assist in any manner  the enforcement of this section.  An employer 
6 may not prohibit an employee from disclosing the employee's own wages  or from  
7 inquiring about or disclosing another employee's wages if the purpose of the disclosure or 
8 inquiry is to enforce the rights  granted by this section.  Nothing in this section creates an 
9 obligation to disclose wages.
10 SUMMARY
11 This bill amends the Maine Human Rights Act to provide that evidence  of 
12 discrimination with respect  to compensation  includes an employer seeking information  
13 about a prospective  employee's prior wage history before an offer of employment,  
14 including all compensation, to the prospective employee has been made.  It provides  that 
15 this discrimination  is also evidenced by an employer requiring that a prospective 
16 employee's prior  compensation  history meet certain criteria.  The bill broadens a 
17 provision in the current  equal pay law to prohibit an employer from  preventing 
18 employees from  discussing or disclosing other employees'  wages and makes the practice 
19 a violation of the  Maine  Human Rights Act as well.
