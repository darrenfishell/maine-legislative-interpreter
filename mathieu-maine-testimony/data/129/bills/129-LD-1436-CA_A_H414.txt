and Montreal Pipe Line Limited parent companies Suncor Energy, Shell Oil Company 
and Imperial Oil Limited to examine opp01tunities for repurposing the Portland-Montreal 
pipeline and related real estate holdings in the State, including consideration of a 
redevelopment strategy and revenue model acceptable to those companies' investors in 
accordance with the companies' own sustainability goals. The asset to be addressed by the 
examination is the pipeline itself, which is to be examined for repurposing as a conduit 
for high-voltage electric transmission lines. The examination of repurposing must 
consider opportunities for existing Portland Pipe Line Corporation and Montreal Pipe 
Line Limited employees to direct their efforts toward the technical and management 
opportunities created by repurposing of the pipeline.
