Sec. 9. Effective date. That section of this Act that amends the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 21-A, section 155, first paragraph takes effect January 1, 2020. Those 
sections of this Act that amend Title 21-A, section 122-A, section 129, first paragraph 
and section 152, subsection 1 and that section of this Act that enacts Title 21-A, chapter 
3, subchapter 9 take effect January 1, 2022. That section of this Act that repeals and 
replaces Title 21-A, section 195 takes effect January 1, 2023.' 
7 SUMMARY 
8 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes the following 
9 changes to the automatic voter registration system established in the bill. 
10 1. It clarifies the process for automatic voter registration. When an individual doing 
11 business with a source agency provides information demonstrating the individual's 
12 eligibility to vote, the individual must be notified that the individual's information will be 
13 used to register that individual to vote unless the individual declines to be registered. If 
14 the individual does not opt out, the source agency must create a pending voter registration 
15 record and transmit that record to the applicable registrar of voters, who shall dete1mine 
16 whether the individual is eligible to vote. If the individual is eligible to vote, the registrar 
17 must enter the individual's infotmation in the central voter registration system or, if the 
18 individual is already registered to vote, the registrar must update the central voter 
19 registration system with the individual's change of name or address, if any. 
20 2. As in the bill, the Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles 
21 is automatically designated a "source agency" through which automatic voter registration 
22 takes place. Unlike the bill, the amendment grants authority to designate other source 
23 agencies only to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may designate as a source 
24 agency a state entity or department or another entity designated by Section 7 of the 
25 National Voter Registration Act of 1993, as long as the Secretary of State verifies that the 
26 department, agency or entity collects documents that provide proof of voter eligibility as 
27 part of its normal course of business. 
28 3. It eliminates the provisions of the bill establishing specific privacy and security 
29 measures and specific restrictions against the misuse of voter registration information, 
30 allowing the Secretary of State to adopt rules related to these topics. 
31 4. It changes the rules that the Secretary of State may adopt to implement the 
32 automatic voter registration system from major substantive rules to routine technical 
33 rules. 
34 5. It changes to January 1, 2020 the effective date of the provision of the bill that 
35 lowers the age at which a person may submit a conditional registration to vote and enroll 
36 in a political party. 
37 6. As in the bill, automatic voter registration is effective Januaiy 1, 2022. Unlike the 
38 bill, the amendment directs the Secretary of State to submit, by January 1, 2020, a report 
39 to the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs on the progress made 
40 toward implementing automatic voter registration and the estimated time required to 
41 complete all activities necessary for implementation. The Joint Standing Committee on 
42 Veterans and Legal Affairs may report out legislation to the Second Regular Session of 
43 the 129th Legislature based on the report.
