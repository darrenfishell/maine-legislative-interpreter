SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, removes the 
requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services automatically review an 
individual's eligibility for the family planning benefit if the individual is found ineligible 
under another MaineCare section. It also removes the requirement that the department 
use a single application form. This amendment clarifies that presumptive eligibility must 
be implemented in accordance with 42 United States Code, Section 1396r-1, which 
outlines the timing and other requirements of presumptive eligibility for states.

Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
The presumptive eligibility language in the bill could increase costs to the Department of Health and Human Services 
as new individuals could apply and receive MaineCare eligibility. As it is unknown how many individuals would 
become eligible who would not have applied for eligbility without the presumptive eligibility determination from the 
provider, no fiscal estimate of these costs can be provided at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Depmtment of Health and Human Services for rule-making are expected to be minor and 
can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
