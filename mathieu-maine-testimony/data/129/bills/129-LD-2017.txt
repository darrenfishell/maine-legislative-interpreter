19establish the pilot project with the following requirements:
20A.  The construction of a maximum of 3 energy-to-gas facilities, each up to 10 
21megawatts in production capacity;
22B.  Siting requirements for the energy-to-gas facilities that maximize the use and 
23availability of renewable energy; and
24C.  An expiration date for the pilot project of December 31, 2026.
253.  One-time exemption from transmission and distribution charges.  Renewable 
26energy transmitted to an energy-to-gas facility for conversion to methane gas pursuant to 
27the pilot project is exempt from transmission and distribution charges for delivery of

Page 2 - 129LR3079(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to develop and oversee a pilot 
3project for the conversion of excess renewable energy generated from sources such as 
4wind, solar or tidal power into methane gas and the storage of the converted methane gas 
5for future use.  Up to 3 energy-to-gas facilities, each up to 10 megawatts in production 
6capacity, may be established.  The transmission of the renewable energy to an energy-to-
7gas facility is exempt from all transmission and distribution charges.  The commission is
