STATE OF MAINE 
SENATE 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 674, L.D. 1972, Bill, "An Act To 
Increase Access to and Reduce the Cost of Epinephrine Autoinjectors by Amending the 
Definition of "Epinephrine Autoinjector"" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, this Act expands the definition of "epinephrine autoinjector" to include 
devices approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration that deliver a specific 
dose of epinephrine by means other than automatic injection; and 
Whereas, this Act provides more flexibility for entities, including, but not limited 
to, recreation camps, colleges, universities, day care facilities, youth sports leagues, 
amusement parks, restaurants and sports arenas, that purchase epinephrine for emergency 
purposes to consider lower-cost alternatives; and 
Whereas, this Act, if it becomes effective prior to the expiration of the 90-day 
period, could provide financial relief to youth camps, recreational camps, municipal 
recreation programs and amusement parks before the upcoming summer season; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited m the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively.
