6territories of the utilities in accordance with this subsection.  For the purposes of this

8located within the State that relies on solar photovoltaic arrays to generate electricity and 
9is community-based, as defined by the commission by rule.
10A.  The commission shall direct investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities 
11to procure up to 100 megawatts from community-based solar resources through long-
12term contracts.  The commission shall ensure that at least 20% of resources procured 
13under this subsection are procured through long-term contracts with community-
14based solar resources with a nameplate capacity of less than 2 megawatts.

19subsection if the community-based solar resource and its owners meet at least the 
20following requirements:
21(1)  The resource has a nameplate capacity of no more than 10 megawatts;
22(2)  The resource has an in-service date of no earlier than June 30, 2020 and no 
23later than December 31, 2021;
24(3)  Ownership of the resource is at least 75% accounted for by qualified owners.

2The contract rate must be less than 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the rate must be 
3fixed for a period of at least 20 years.  Contracts may be for energy or capacity.  The 
4contracts may also include renewable energy credits, or the owners of the 
5community-based solar resource may retain the renewable energy credits associated 
6with the resource, as determined by the owners.
7E.  Available energy contracted for pursuant to this subsection must be sold into the

9supply bids in a manner that ensures that the energy is incorporated into the standard

132-A.
14SUMMARY
15This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to direct investor-owned 
16transmission and distribution utilities to enter into long-term contracts with community-
17based solar photovoltaic energy generating facilities.  The total amount of resources 
18procured through these long-term contracts may not exceed 100 megawatts, and 20% of 
19resources procured must come from generators with a capacity of less than 2 megawatts.  
20The bill requires the commission to establish provisions to protect the interests of utility 
21customers over the term of the contracts.
22The bill sets forth eligibility requirements for community-based solar resources to 
23enter into long-term contracts.  To be eligible, a resource must have a capacity of no more 
24than 10 megawatts, have an in-service date between June 30, 2020 and December 31, 
252021 and meet local ownership requirements. In addition, to be eligible, the owners of the 
26resource must:
271.   Demonstrate to the Public Utilities Commission completion of an interconnection 
28agreement application with the local transmission and distribution utility;
292.  Include a plan to obtain all required federal, state and local permits and approvals;
303.  Demonstrate financial capability to operate the resource over the term of the

35community in which the resource is located.
36The bill establishes a minimum contract length of 20 years and requires the contract 
37rate to be less than 9 cents per kilowatt-hour and fixed for a period of at least 20 years.  
38Contracts may be for energy or capacity.  The contracts may also include renewable 
39energy credits, or the owners of the resource may retain the renewable energy credits 
Page 3 - 129LR1621(01)-11associated with the resource, as determined by the owners.  Finally, the bill specifies that 
2available energy contracted for under the provisions of this bill must be sold into the 
3wholesale electricity market in conjunction with solicitations for standard-offer supply 
4bids.
