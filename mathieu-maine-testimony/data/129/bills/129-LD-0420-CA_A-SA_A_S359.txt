13 1. Exclusion from estate tax for family farms; definitions. Notwithstanding any 
14 provision of law to the contrary, farmland that is part of an estate of a decedent dying on

16 from taxation under this chapter as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, 
17 "farmland" means land that is or could be classified as farmland under chapter 105, 
18 subchapter 10 and includes personal property that is exempt from property tax under 
19 section 655, subsection 1, paragraph C, D, Mor 0. For purposes of this section, "family

22 grandparent; ancestor; or lineal descendant. 
23 2. Requirements for exclusion; report. In order to qualify for the exclusion from

28 of that transferee, a family member of that transferee; and 
29 C. During the 5 years following the transfer, the land transferred must continue to

SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is based on Pennsylvania law, excludes from the estate tax 
farmland transferred to a family member. Farmland is defined as real estate that qualifies 
as farmland under the farmland and open space tax law and includes personal property, 
such as agricultural produce, livestock and farm machinery, that is exempt from taxation. 
Family member is broadly defined to be, whether by blood or adoption, a sibling, parent, 
spouse, grandparent, ancestor or lineal descendant. 
The land must continue to qualify as farmland for the 5 years following the death of 
the decedent, including producing an annual gross income from farming activities of at 
least $2,000. If at any time during the 5 years that land does not meet the qualifications, 
the owner is required to pay the estate tax based on the value of the property at the time · 
of the decedent's death. (!
