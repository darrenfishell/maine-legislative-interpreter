12in the Canadian branded or generic formula, will not present an unreasonable risk to

14necessary drugs for consumers in the State.

24SUMMARY
25Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the importation of unapproved new 
26prescription drugs, including foreign-made versions of prescription drugs that have been 
27approved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug 
28Administration, is prohibited. However, the Food and Drug Administration has developed 
29guidance that allows the personal importation of certain drugs.
30This bill, using the guidance developed by the federal Department of Health and 
31Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, enacts the Maine Pharmaceutical Drug 
32Safety Act to allow an individual in Maine to import prescription drugs from Canada as 
33long as specific criteria are met, including that the drug is imported for personal use, that 
34the individual importing the drug has a valid prescription, that the drug does not present 
35an unreasonable risk to the individual and that no more than a 90-day supply of the drug 
36is imported.  The prescription drug to be imported must also meet specific requirements. 
37The importation of controlled substances and prescription drugs for sale or resale is 
38specifically prohibited.
