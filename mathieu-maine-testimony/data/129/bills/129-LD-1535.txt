7the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
8immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
9therefore,
10Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
11Sec. 1.  18-C MRSA §1-108, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 402, Pt. A, §2 
12and affected by Pt. F, §1, is amended to read:
132.  Automatic adjustment of amounts for inflation.  The dollar amounts stated in 
14sections 2-102, 2-402, 2-403 and, 2-405 and 3-1201 apply to the estate of a decedent who 
15died in or after 2017, but for the estate of a decedent who died after 2018, these dollar 
16amounts must be increased or decreased if the Consumer Price Index for the calendar 
17year immediately preceding the year of death exceeds or is less than the reference base 
18index.  The amount of any increase or decrease is computed by multiplying each dollar 
19amount by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 
20immediately preceding the year of death exceeds or is less than the reference base index.  
21If any increase or decrease produced by the computation is not a multiple of $100, the 
22increase or decrease is rounded down, if an increase, or up, if a decrease, to the next 
23multiple of $100, but for the purpose of section 2-405, the periodic installment amount is 
24the lump-sum amount divided by 12.  If the Consumer Price Index for 2018 is changed by 
25the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reference base 
26index must be revised using the rebasing factor reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
27or other comparable data if a rebasing factor is not reported.

4specifically provide for such an allocation to the estate for the same.  In addition, the jury 
5may give damages not exceeding $500,000 for the loss of comfort, society and 
6companionship of the deceased, including any damages for emotional distress arising 
7from the same facts as those constituting the underlying claim, to the persons for whose

11may be commenced within 6 years of the date the personal representative or special 
12administrator of the decedent discovers that there is a just cause of action against the 
13person who caused the homicide.  If a claim under this section is settled without an action 
14having been commenced, the amount paid in settlement must be distributed as provided

221.  Appointment.  On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may:
23A.  Appoint a guardian for a respondent who is an adult if it finds by clear and 
24convincing evidence that the respondent lacks the ability to meet essential 
25requirements for physical health, safety or self-care because:

27communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive services, technological 
28assistance or supported decision making that provides adequate protection for the 
29respondent;
30(2)  The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective arrangement 
31instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives that provide adequate 
32protection for the respondent; and
33(3)  The appointment is necessary or desirable as a means of enabling the 
34respondent to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety or self-care; 
35or
36B.  With appropriate findings, and additional notice to persons the court determines 
37are entitled to notice, treat the petition as one for a conservatorship under Part 4 or a 
38protective arrangement instead of guardianship or conservatorship under Part 5, enter 
39any other appropriate order or dismiss the proceeding.
Page 7 - 129LR0219(01)-112.  Powers.  The court shall grant to a guardian appointed under subsection 1 only 
2those powers necessitated by the limitations and demonstrated needs of the respondent 
3and enter orders that will encourage the development of the respondent's maximum self-
4determination and independence.  The court may not establish a full guardianship if a

15SUMMARY
16This bill is submitted pursuant to Public Law 2017, chapter 402, Part G, section 2.
17This bill contains recommendations submitted by the Probate and Trust Law 
18Advisory Commission and the Family Law Advisory Commission.  It makes the 
19following changes to the Maine Uniform Probate Code.
201.  It adds a cross-reference to the section regarding cost-of-living adjustments to 
21include the section authorizing the collection of personal property by affidavit.  By 
22including the cross-reference, the cost-of-living adjustment will adjust the cap on the 
23value of property that can be collected by filing an affidavit, to keep the amount 
24economically relevant.
252.  It amends the section regarding actions for wrongful death to correct a cross-
26reference to the Maine laws of intestacy.
273.  It includes an exception to the 3-year limitation period for filing claims against a 
28decedent's estate to allow proceedings to be commenced against the estate up to 6 years 
29after a personal injury cause of action accrues if the claimant does not have actual notice 
30of the decedent's death.  If the proceedings are commenced more than 3 years after the 
31decedent's death, any recovery is limited to applicable insurance.  This exception was 
32included in the Maine Revised Statutes, former Title 18-A, section 3-108, subsection (a), 
33paragraph (4) and was inadvertently omitted in the enactment of Title 18-C.
344. It revises the short title of the first 5 Parts of Article 5 to "the Maine Uniform 
35Guardianship, Conservatorship and Protective Proceedings Act."
365.  It revises the provision on transferring money or personal property to minors in 2 
37ways.  It replaces the $10,000 cap with a reference to the annual gift tax exclusion in 26 
38United States Code, Section 2503, and it authorizes transfers to qualified tuition programs 
39in the State under Section 529 and qualified ABLE programs in the State under Section 
40529A of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Page 37 - 129LR0219(01)-116.  In the general provisions applicable to guardianships and conservatorships, it 
2requires that proof of notice must be filed before a hearing.
37.  It allows a respondent, an individual subject to guardianship, conservatorship or 
4other protective arrangement or an appointed guardian or conservator to waive notice if 
5represented by an attorney.
68.  It allows the guardian, the conservator and the individual subject to guardianship, 
7conservatorship or other protective arrangement to object to any person's request for 
8notice.
99.  It provides that an attorney or other person providing beneficial services to the 
10respondent or individual subject to guardianship, conservatorship or other protective 
11arrangement is entitled to reasonable compensation, unless the court has made a finding 
12that the respondent is indigent.
1310.  It authorizes the court to review the reasonableness of compensation and the 
14appropriateness of services provided by an attorney for the respondent or an individual 
15subject to guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement.  It also 
16authorizes the court to assess attorney's fees or other costs incurred by the respondent 
17against the petitioner if the petition is dismissed and was filed in bad faith.
1811.  It provides that a guardian or conservator can petition the court to require a 3rd 
19party to recognize the authority of the guardian or conservator, as well as accept a 
20decision of the guardian or conservator.  If the court finds that the refusal of a 3rd party 
21was made in bad faith and without justification, the court may charge the 3rd party for 
22attorney's fees and costs.  Notice of the petition for an order to recognize the authority or 
23accept the decision of the guardian or conservator must be provided to the adult subject to 
24guardianship or conservatorship and everyone else entitled to notice.
2512.  It addresses an inconsistency and a potential constitutional infirmity in the minor 
26guardianship termination provision in Title 18-C, section 5-210, subsection 7 identified 
27by the Family Law Advisory Commission.  Subsection 7 establishes the standards and 
28burdens of proof applicable to a parent's petition to terminate a minor guardianship when 
29the termination is opposed by the guardian.  This bill provides that the guardian has the 
30burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the parent seeking to terminate 
31the guardianship is currently unfit to regain custody of the minor.
3213.  It requires the court, in determining whether to appoint a guardian, to find that 
33any appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supportive decision 
34making provides adequate protection for the particular respondent.  It adds that a less 
35restrictive alternative to guardianship must provide adequate protection for the 
36respondent.
3714.  It  gives the court discretion as to whether to require the visitor to carry out 
38additional duties that are mandatory under the uniform act:  interviewing the petitioner 
39and proposed guardian, visiting the respondent's present and proposed future dwelling, 
40obtaining information from health care providers and investigating allegations in the 
41petition.  The visitor must report on the respondent's medical conditions, cognitive 
Page 38 - 129LR0219(01)-11functioning, everyday functioning, preferences and values.  The report must also include 
2a statement as to whether the respondent wishes to attend the hearing.
315.  It provides that if the respondent exercises the right to decline to participate in a 
4professional evaluation or refuses to provide medical reports, the court may enter an order 
5of guardianship or other protective arrangement if the court otherwise finds that there is a 
6basis for the order.
716.  Throughout Article 5, Parts 3, 4 and 5, it provides that participation in a hearing 
8by telephone, rather than real-time audiovisual technology, is permitted only if real-time 
9audiovisual technology is not available.
1017.  In the provisions governing confidentiality of records regarding adult 
11guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements, it establishes an 
12effective date of January 1, 2021 to provide sufficient time for the Supreme Judicial 
13Court to adopt rules governing the confidentiality of all court records.
1418.  It adds as potential guardians, in higher priority than another family member or 
15other individual who has exhibited special care or concern for the respondent, the 
16following categories of people, in order of priority:  an adult child of the respondent; a 
17parent of the respondent, including a person nominated by will or other writing signed by 
18a deceased parent; and a relative of the respondent with whom the respondent resided for 
19more than 6 months within the 12 months prior to the filing of the petition.  It also 
20provides factors for the court to consider in determining the best interest of the 
21respondent when appointing a guardian who is of lower priority or no priority, including 
22the likelihood that the potential guardian will be able to satisfy the duties of a guardian 
23successfully.
2419.  It provides that the right to vote and the right marry are automatically preserved 
25when a guardian is appointed, unless the court orders otherwise.
2620.  It deletes the requirement that the guardian give notice when the guardian is 
27unavailable to visit the person subject to guardianship for more than 2 months.
2821.  It revises the authority of a guardian to administer the assets of the individual 
29subject to guardianship from $5,000 to $10,000, which is consistent with the MaineCare 
30limit for countable assets.
3122.  It authorizes a guardian to receive personal effects.  It specifically provides that 
32the guardian may not use funds from the estate of the adult subject to guardianship for 
33room and board that the guardian or the guardian's spouse, parent or child has furnished 
34to the adult unless a charge for the services is approved by order of the court.  It expands 
35the authority of a guardian to establish or move the permanent dwelling of the adult to 
36permit such a move if it is generally set forth in the guardian's plan.  It also gives a 
37guardian the authority to establish or move the permanent place of dwelling without the 
38otherwise required advance notice if the guardian has a compelling reason and subsequent 
39prompt notice is provided to the adult and persons entitled to notice.  The authority of a 
40guardian to sell or surrender the lease to the primary dwelling is expanded to permit such 
41action if it is generally set forth in the guardian's plan or if notice of the proposed action is 
Page 39 - 129LR0219(01)-11given as required and no objection is filed within 14 days of the notice.  It creates an 
2exception, for guardianships established prior to the July 1, 2019 effective date of Title 
318-C, to the imposition of certain duties and restrictions of powers until an express order 
4of the court so directs the guardian.
523.  It authorizes a guardian to restrict the access of any person upon good cause but 
6the guardian must provide immediate oral and written notice to the adult subject to 
7guardianship and notice to all others entitled to notice within 7 days of the imposition of 
8the restriction.  It creates an exception, for guardianships established prior to the July 1, 
92019 effective date of Title 18-C, to the imposition of certain duties of notice and 
10restrictions of powers until an express order of the court so directs the guardian.
1124.  It adds a requirement that the guardian's plan identify the adult's medical 
12conditions, cognitive functioning, everyday functioning and levels of supervision needed 
13for the adult subject to guardianship.  With regard to revised plans, it creates a right to 
14object for all appropriate parties within 14 days of receipt of notice of the revised plan.  
15Although the court may elect to schedule a hearing on a revised plan, a revised plan may 
16be implemented without hearing 30 days after filing unless the court orders otherwise.  It 
17creates an exception, for guardianships established prior to the July 1, 2019 effective date 
18of Title 18-C, to the requirement to file a revised plan until an express order of the court 
19so directs the guardian.
2025.  It gives statutory recognition of the guardian's authority to hire an agent to visit 
21on behalf of the guardian.   It adds a requirement that the guardian's report include a 
22statement of fees paid to the guardian during the report year and fees still outstanding for 
23the report year.  Unless there is an existing order to file annual reports, it creates an 
24exception, for guardianships established prior to the July 1, 2019 effective date of Title 
2518-C, to the requirement to file an annual report until an express order of the court so 
26directs the guardian.
2726.  It requires the court to find that any appropriate supportive services, 
28technological assistance or supported decision making provides adequate protection for 
29the particular respondent and that a less restrictive alternative to conservatorship provides 
30adequate protection for the respondent.
3127.  It revises the petition for appointment of a conservator to require a brief 
32description of the respondent's needs based on medical condition, cognitive functioning, 
33everyday financial functioning and needed levels of supervision.
3428.  It repeals Title 18-C, section 5-404, which was carried over from the former Title 
3518-A, section 5-404, and enacts Title 18-C, section 5-404-A.  Section 5-404-A is derived 
36from section 404 of the Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective 
37Arrangements Act and concerns an order to preserve property while a petition for 
38appointment of a conservator is pending.
3929.  It revises the duties of a visitor appointed when a petition is filed for the 
40appointment of a conservator to give the court discretion to tailor the duties in each case.  
41It also provides for the visitor to report on whether or not the respondent wishes to attend 
42the hearing after the respondent has been fully informed by the visitor.
Page 40 - 129LR0219(01)-1130.  It provides that if the respondent exercises the right to decline to participate in a 
2professional evaluation or refuses to provide medical reports, the court may enter an order 
3of conservatorship or other protective arrangement if the court otherwise finds that there 
4is a basis for the order.
531.  It revises the priority of who may be appointed as a conservator to include an 
6adult child of the respondent, then a parent of the respondent or a person nominated in the 
7will of a deceased parent before a family member or other individual who has exhibited 
8special care and concern for the respondent.  It also provides factors for the court to 
9consider in determining the best interest of the respondent when appointing a conservator 
10who is of lower priority or no priority, including the likelihood that the potential 
11conservator will be able to satisfy the duties of a conservator successfully.
1232.  It creates an exception, for conservatorships established prior to the July 1, 2019 
13effective date of Title 18-C, to the imposition of certain notice and court authorization 
14requirements until an express order of the court so directs the conservator.
1533.  It requires a bond only for estates of $50,000 or more, although the court may 
16require a bond for an estate of less than $50,000.  It also preserves the discretionary 
17waiver of the bond requirement for a spouse in the former Title 18-A, section 5-411.
1834.  It requires that notice of any conservator's revised plan must include a statement 
19of the right of any party to object within 14 days of the receipt of notice.  It gives the 
20court discretion to approve a revised plan with or without a hearing 30 days after filing 
21and authorizes a conservator to implement the revised plan 30 days after filing unless the 
22court orders otherwise.  It also creates an exception, for conservatorships established prior 
23to the July 1, 2019 effective date of Title 18-C, to the requirement to file a revised plan 
24until an express order of the court so directs the conservator.
2535.  It changes the inventory provisions for conservatorship estates to a 90-day filing 
26requirement, replacing the 60-day filing requirement in the Code as enacted.
2736.  It creates an exception for conservatorships established prior to January 1, 2008 
28to the requirement to file an annual report and accounting until an express order of the 
29court so directs.  The January 1, 2008 date is consistent with the provisions of former 
30Title 18-A, section 5-419, which required a private conservator appointed after January 1, 
312008 to file an annual account with the court.
3237.  It provides that when a conservatorship terminates, property of the estate passes 
33to the individual formerly subject to conservatorship or other persons entitled to the 
34property.
3538.  It clarifies that when ordering other protective arrangements for a respondent, the 
36court must find that the respondent needs more assistance than available through 
37appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported decision making 
38that provides adequate protection for the respondent and that the respondent's needs 
39cannot be met by less restrictive alternatives.
Page 41 - 129LR0219(01)-1139.  It provides that the court, instead of appointing a conservator, may authorize the 
2creation, modification, amendment or revocation of a will or codicil.  It also revises the 
3court's authority to restrict access to the respondent or the respondent's property by a 
4person by providing that the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the 
5person poses a significant risk of harm to the respondent or the respondent's property.
640.  It revises the required duties of a visitor to give the court discretion as to whether 
7to require the visitor to carry out additional duties that are mandatory under the uniform 
8act.  The visitor must report on the respondent's medical conditions, cognitive 
9functioning, everyday functioning, preferences and values, risks and levels of supervision 
10needed and any means to enhance the respondent's capacity.  The report must also include 
11a statement as to whether the respondent wishes to attend a hearing.
1241.  It provides that if the respondent exercises the right to decline to participate in a 
13professional evaluation or refuses to provide medical reports, the court may enter an order 
14for a protective arrangement if the court otherwise finds that there is a basis for the order.

16recommendations on the following matters related to the Maine Uniform Probate Code:  
17petitions for termination of parental rights in the context of adoption; competing adoption 
18petitions; and rights of contact between a minor and the former guardian when the 
19guardianship is terminated.  The Family Law Advisory Commission is required to submit 
20a report, including specific recommendations for amendments to the Maine Uniform 
21Probate Code and other family law statutes, to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
22by December 1, 2019.
2343.  It enacts as new Article 10 the Maine Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to 
24Digital Assets Act, originally enacted by Public Law 2017, chapter 359, which was 
25enacted as Article 10 of former Title 18-A.
