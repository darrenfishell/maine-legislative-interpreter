15coliform, E. coli, Enterococcus, conductivity, color, temperature and dissolved oxygen 
16without being certified under this section.  The exception provided under this paragraph 
17applies to a laboratory testing its own samples for pollutants listed in its permit or license;

40findings of fact and vote on a decision that continues, revokes or modifies the order.  That 
41decision must be in writing and signed by the board chair using any means for signature 
Page 4 - 129LR2389(01)-11authorized in the department's rules and published within 2 14 working days after the

7decision of the board may be appealed to the Superior Court in accordance with Title 5, 
8chapter 375, subchapter 7.
9SUMMARY
10This bill makes minor adjustments to laws administered by or that affect the 
11Department of Environmental Protection.  The bill authorizes laboratories operated by a 
12waste discharge facility to analyze waste discharges for Enterococcus without being 
13certified under a state laboratory certification or accreditation program.  It changes the 
14timelines regarding appeals under the laws governing uncontrolled hazardous substance 
15sites.  It changes the rule-making authority from the Board of Environmental Protection 
16to the Commissioner of Environmental Protection for certain rules regarding waste 
17management.
