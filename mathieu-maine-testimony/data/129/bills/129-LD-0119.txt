3further amended to read:

7commercial motor vehicle or bus under Title 36, section 1482, subsection 1, 
8paragraph C, subparagraph (3) or (4) using the manufacturer's suggested retail price 
9from the amount of that excise tax actually collected by that municipality in the prior 
10fiscal year based on the actual purchase price.  The Secretary of State shall provide 
11supporting documentation to a municipality regarding the disbursement that 
12municipality receives under this section.
13Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1482, sub-§1, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §1, is 
14further amended to read:
15C.  For the privilege of operating a motor vehicle, including a commercial motor 
16vehicle as defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 17, paragraphs A and B and 
17special mobile equipment as defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 70, or 
18camper trailer on the public ways, each motor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or 
19each camper trailer to be so operated is subject to excise tax as follows, except as 
20specified in subparagraph (3), (4) or (5):  a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the 
21maker's list purchase price for the first or current year of model, 17 1/2 mills for the 
222nd year, 13 1/2 mills for the 3rd year, 10 mills for the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 
235th year and 4 mills for the 6th and succeeding years.  The minimum tax is $5 for a 
24motor vehicle other than a bicycle with motor attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with 
25motor attached, $15 for a camper trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent 
26trailer.  The excise tax on a stock race car is $5.
27(1)  On new registrations of automobiles, trucks and truck tractors, the excise tax 
28payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one-year period from the 
29date of registration.
30(2)  Vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan are subject to an 
31excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if their registration period is 
32less than 12 months.
33(3)  For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the 
34amount of excise tax due for trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 
3526,000 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title 
3629-A, section 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original 
37year of title rather than on the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the 
38application of excise tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales 
39tax document provided at point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued 
40by the dealer to the initial purchaser of a new vehicle.
41(4)  For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise 
42tax due is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on 
Page 2 - 129LR0181(01)-11the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is 
2determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided at 
3point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
4purchaser of a new vehicle.
5(5)  For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have 
6been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle 
7or body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new 
8certificate of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based 
9on the maker's list price of the prepackaged kit.
10For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29-A, section 405, subsection 1, 
11paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 
12registration.
13Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §1482, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §2, is further 
14amended to read:
154.  Maker's list price.  The maker's list price of a vehicle to be used must be obtained 
16from sources approved by the State Tax Assessor, except for a truck or truck tractor 
17described under subsection 1, paragraph C, subparagraph (5).  When the maker's list price 
18of a vehicle is not readily obtainable the State Tax Assessor shall prescribe the maker's 
19list price to be used or the manner in which the maker's list price is determined. 
20A.  At the time of payment of the excise tax prior to a new registration for a new 
21passenger vehicle purchased from a motor vehicle dealer licensed in any state for the 
22sale of new passenger vehicles, the owner shall submit the manufacturer's suggested 
23retail price sticker, or a copy of the sticker, to the excise tax collector.  In the case of 
24rental and fleet vehicles, other documentation may be provided at the discretion of 
25the municipal excise tax collector.
26This paragraph applies only to those vehicles for which a manufacturer's suggested 
27retail price sticker is required by the Federal Government.
28SUMMARY
29This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 
30vehicles and camper trailers registered in the State.
31With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles and buses and special 
32mobile equipment, current law requires that the excise tax be based upon the maker's list 
33price for the motor vehicle; the excise tax on certain commercial motor vehicles and 
34buses and special mobile equipment is based on the purchase price.
35This bill requires that the excise tax for all motor vehicles and camper trailers be 
36based upon the purchase price of the vehicle.  Either the original bill of sale or the state 
37sales tax document may be used to verify the purchase price.
38Current law requires the State to reimburse a municipality for the difference in the 
39amount of excise tax that would have been collected by the municipality on each 
Page 3 - 129LR0181(01)-11commercial motor vehicle or bus using the manufacturer's suggested retail price instead 
2of the actual purchase price.
3This bill applies that requirement to all vehicles registered and taxed by the 
4municipality using the actual purchase price.
