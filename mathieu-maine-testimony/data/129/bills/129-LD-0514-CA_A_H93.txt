SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill, which requires election clerks in a municipality to be selected so that 33% of 
clerks are from one major party, 33% are from another major party and 34% are selected 
without regard to party enrollment. This amendment amends the process for selection of 
election clerks and clarifies other provisions regarding election clerks. 
Specifically, the amendment retains' the provision in current law allowing parties to 
nominate election clerks but also allows the municipal clerk or any registered voter to 
make nominations. Like current law, the amendment directs timely consideration of 
nominations but does not require municipal officers to appoint the election clet1cs from 
among nominees and instead allows them to appoint any qualified voter. Under the 
amendment, the minimum requirement is 2 election clerks at each voting place, one each 
from the 2 major parties. The amendment requires that at least 1/2 of the election clerks 
working at any election are affiliated with the major patties, and the rest of the election 
clerks may be affiliated with a minor party or be unenrolled. 
The amendment also provides that if the municipal officers do not appoint a sufficient 
number of election clerks representing· the major parties or an insufficient number of 
appointees are available to serve from the list provided by municipal officers, the 
municipal clerk may appoint additional election clerks without regard to party enrollment 
status.
