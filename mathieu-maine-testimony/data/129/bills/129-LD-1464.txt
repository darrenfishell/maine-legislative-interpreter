Page 1 - 129LR1860(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §10102, sub-§3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Beneficial electrification.  "Beneficial electrification" means electrification of 
4a technology that would otherwise require energy from a fossil fuel that provides a 
5benefit to a utility, a ratepayer or the environment by improving the efficiency of the 
6electricity grid or reducing consumer costs or emissions, including carbon emissions.
7Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, 
8§3, is amended to read:
9C.  "Conservation programs" means programs developed by the trust pursuant to this 
10section designed to reduce inefficient electricity use or to increase the efficiency with 
11which electricity is used.
12Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§2, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, 
13§3, is amended to read:
14A.  The trust shall consider, without limitation, conservation programs that:
15(1)  Increase consumer awareness of cost-effective options for conserving energy;
16(2)  Create more favorable market conditions for the increased use of energy-
17efficient products and services;
18(3)  Promote sustainable economic development and reduce environmental 
19damage; 
20(4)  Reduce the price of electricity over time for all consumers by achieving 
21reductions in demand for electricity during peak use periods, including by the 
22implementation of beneficial electrification; and
23(5)  Reduce total energy costs for electricity consumers in the State by increasing 
24the efficiency with which electricity is consumed.
25Sec. 4.  Efficiency Maine Trust to study barriers to beneficial 
26electrification.  The Efficiency Maine Trust established in the Maine Revised Statutes, 
27Title 35-A, section 10103, in coordination with the Public Utilities Commission, shall 
28study barriers to beneficial electrification in the transportation and heating sectors in the 
29State.  The study must identify social, technological, legal, regulatory and economic 
30barriers to beneficial electrification for the transportation and heating sectors in the State.  
31The study must include information, which the trust may request the commission to 
32compile, on potential roles for electric utilities, natural gas utilities and competitive 
33markets in supporting beneficial electrification, including benefits and drawbacks of these 
34potential roles and examples of specific activities that may be conducted and specific 
35needs that may be best served by the electric utilities, natural gas utilities or competitive 
36markets.  The Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority shall 
37provide information to the trust on potential barriers to beneficial electrification and 
38solutions to overcome those barriers in areas under their jurisdiction.  The trust may seek 
39information regarding the study from other agencies or from private persons, 
Page 2 - 129LR1860(01)-11organizations or interest groups.  The trust shall provide public notice of the opportunity 
2for the public to submit written information or comments to the trust before and after a 
3draft of the study is completed.  The trust shall develop a report based on the study.  The 
4report must:
51.  Identify barriers to beneficial electrification in the transportation and heating 
6sectors of the State;
72.  Identify additional information that the trust may require to make additional 
8recommendations or analyses;
93.  Consider potential roles of utilities in supporting beneficial electrification;
104.  Identify areas or populations in the State less likely to benefit directly from 
11beneficial electrification without additional policy development or utility intervention; 
12and
135.  Recommend opportunities for beneficial electrification.
14By February 1, 2020, the trust shall submit its report and any recommended 
15legislation to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology.  The 
16committee may report out legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 129th 
17Legislature related to the report.
18For purposes of this section, "beneficial electrification" means electrification of a 
19technology that would otherwise require energy from a fossil fuel that provides a benefit 
20to a utility, a ratepayer or the environment by improving the efficiency of the electricity 
21grid or reducing consumer costs or emissions, including carbon emissions.
22Sec. 5.  Public Utilities Commission to request proposals for pilot 
23program to implement beneficial electrification in the transportation sector.  
24The Public Utilities Commission, referred to in this section as "the commission," shall 
25request proposals from utilities and from entities that are not utilities, including the 
26Efficiency Maine Trust established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 
2710103 for pilot programs that are limited in duration and scope to support beneficial 
28electrification of the transportation sector of the State.
291.  Proposals under this section must be submitted to the commission no later than 
30February 1, 2020 and must consider and implement the analysis and recommendations of 
31the study conducted under section 4.  A proposal under this section may address:
32A.  Electric vehicle chargers that make use of load management.  For purposes of this 
33paragraph, "load management" means the process of balancing the supply of 
34electricity on a network with the electrical load by adjusting the load rather than the 
35power station output;
36B.  Utility investment in electricity delivery infrastructure for direct current electric 
37vehicle fast-charging technology, including polyphase electric service;
Page 3 - 129LR1860(01)-11C.  Fees for the delivery of electricity for direct current electric vehicle fast-charging 
2technology, including the use of financial incentives or short-term waivers of the 
3fees; and
4D.  Customer engagement and awareness programs.  An applicant shall include the 
5participation of the Efficiency Maine Trust as a neutral 3rd party to provide input into 
6the development and content of information submitted under this paragraph.
7The commission shall allow public comment on a proposal submitted under this section.  
8On or before October 1, 2020, the commission may select one or more proposals 
9submitted under this section that further the efforts regarding beneficial electrification.
102.  Subsequent to the selection of proposals under subsection 1, the commission may 
11request additional proposals under this section that include criteria under subsection 1 and 
12other criteria the commission determines necessary to be submitted no earlier than 
13December 1, 2020.  A proposal submitted under this subsection must be reviewed 
14pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 4.  The 
15commission shall allow public comment on a proposal submitted under this subsection.  
16On or before August 1, 2021, the commission may select one or more proposals 
17submitted under this subsection that are reasonably likely to result in beneficial 
18electrification.
193.  The commission shall determine a schedule to implement a proposal selected 
20under subsection 1 or 2.  By December 1, 2022, the commission shall complete a review 
21of the implemented pilot program that assesses the effectiveness of each of the program's 
22elements in supporting beneficial electrification of the transportation sector of the State.
234.  For purposes of this section, "beneficial electrification" means electrification of a 
24technology that would otherwise require energy from a fossil fuel that provides a benefit 
25to a utility, a ratepayer or the environment by improving the efficiency of the electricity 
26grid or reducing consumer costs or emissions, including carbon emissions.
27SUMMARY
28This bill:
291.  Amends provisions in the law regarding the conservation programs of the 
30Efficiency Maine Trust by clarifying that conservation programs seek to increase the 
31efficiency with which electricity is used and defining "beneficial electrification" as the 
32electrification of a technology that would otherwise require energy from a fossil fuel that 
33provides a benefit to a utility, a ratepayer or the environment by improving the efficiency 
34of the electricity grid or reducing consumer costs or emissions, including carbon 
35emissions;
362.  Requires the Efficiency Maine Trust to conduct a study regarding the barriers to 
37beneficial electrification of the transportation and heating sectors in the State; and
383.  Requires the Public Utilities Commission to issue a request for proposals from 
39utilities and entities that are not utilities to conduct a pilot program to support beneficial 
40electrification of the transportation sector of the State.
