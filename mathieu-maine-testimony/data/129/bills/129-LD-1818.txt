29SUMMARY
30This bill amends the definition of "antlerless moose" to exclude moose with very 
31small antlers.
32Current law allows the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to prohibit the 
33feeding of deer, bear, moose and wild turkey if there is documented evidence of chronic 
34wasting disease in the State.  This bill allows the commissioner to also limit the feeding.  
35It also allows the commissioner to prohibit or limit the feeding if there is documented 
36evidence of chronic wasting disease in a jurisdiction contiguous to the State or a reason to 
37believe that the type or location of feed may create a public safety hazard or may have a 
38detrimental effect on the wildlife.
Page 3 - 129LR2357(01)-11The bill also provides consistency in the laws regulating the hunting or trapping of 
2wild birds.
3The bill changes the expiration date for a wildlife rehabilitation permit to December 
431st of the 2nd complete year after the date of issuance.
5The bill updates the description of the boundary of the Beauchamp Sanctuary.
6The bill clarifies that hunting is prohibited in the Megunticook Lake and Vicinity 
7Sanctuary from April 1st to September 30th of each year.
