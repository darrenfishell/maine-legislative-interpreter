SECOND REGULAR SESSION

'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the September 16, 2019 explosion in Farmington demonstrates the tragic 
consequences that can result from unmarked underground liquefied propane gas pipes; 
and 
Whereas, the exemption of certain underground liquefied propane gas facilities 
from the so-called dig safe law poses a clear danger to excavators and the public; and 
Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period 
to address, as soon as possible, this significant safety risk by making liquefied propane 
gas distribution systems that have underground pipes subject to the so-called dig safe law; 
and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislatme, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by adding before the summa1y the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'

Fiscal Note 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This bill makes liquefied propane gas distribution systems with underground facilities subject to the so-called dig safe 
law. It also increases administrative penalties for violations of the dig safe law from $500 to $1000 for an initial 
violation and from $5,000 to $10,000 for subsequent violations occurring within 12 months of an earlier violation. 
The increased penalties will increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue for the Public Utilities Commission 
(PUC), The additional revenue is not anticipated to be significant. Any additional costs to the PUC as a result of 
including liquefied propane gas distribution systems in the dig safe law are anticipated to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
