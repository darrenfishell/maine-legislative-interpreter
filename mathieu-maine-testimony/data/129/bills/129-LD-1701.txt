15subchapter that an alleged application of qualification standards, tests or selection criteria

19reasonable accommodation, as required by this subchapter.
20Sec. 4.  5 MRSA §4573-A, sub-§1-B, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 511, §1 and

32a service animal at the public accommodation unless it is shown by defense that the 
33service animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others or the use of the 
34service animal would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others or 
35would substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the public accommodation

37security deposit, although the individual with a physical or mental disability is liable for 
38any damage done to the premises or facilities by such a service animal.  This subsection 
Page 10 - 129LR2281(01)-11does not apply to an assistance animal as defined in section 4553, subsection 1-H unless 
2the assistance animal also qualifies as a service animal.; and
3Sec. 7.  5 MRSA §4592, sub-§9 is enacted to read:

15such person would otherwise be a covered employer, housing provider, public 
16accommodation, educational institution or other covered entity under this Act, when the 
17individual engages in individual and independent unlawful conduct outside the scope of 
18the individual's actions on behalf of a covered entity.
19SUMMARY
20This bill makes changes to the Maine Human Rights Act in order to clarify its proper 
21application and interpretation.  In particular, the bill describes the behaviors that may 
22constitute harassment in reference to unlawful discrimination; clarifies the Act's coverage 
23of claims based on association and based on the perception that an individual belongs to a 
24protected class; and provides a definition of "gender identity."  The bill provides needed 
25clarification related to several Maine Human Rights Act provisions highlighted by recent 
26court decisions, including confirming that a leave of absence can be a reasonable 
27accommodation for a disability in employment, and that individual employees may be 
28liable for their discriminatory behavior in certain circumstances.  The bill also makes 
29grammatical changes and corrects cross-references.
