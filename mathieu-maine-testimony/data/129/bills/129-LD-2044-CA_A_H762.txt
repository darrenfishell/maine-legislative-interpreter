Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Expanding the list of those eligible for the death benefit, increasing the death benefit amount from $50,000 to 
$100,0000 and indexing the benefit amount to the Consumer Price Index will reduce the balance in the Maine Budget 
Stabilization Fund. The exact amount by fiscal year cannot be determined at this time and will depend on the number 
of eligible individuals who die in the line of duty. Any additional costs to the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services to adopt rules to annually calculate an increase in the death benefit based on the previous year's 
increase in the Consumer Price Index are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
