43§2, is further amended to read:
Page 3 - 129LR2478(01)-11A.  Wind energy is an economically feasible, large-scale energy resource that does 
2not rely on fossil fuel combustion or nuclear fission, thereby displacing electrical 
3energy provided by these other sources and avoiding air pollution, waste disposal 
4problems and hazards to human health from emissions, waste and by-products; 
5consequently, wind energy development may address energy needs while making a 
6significant contribution to achievement of the State's renewable energy and 
7greenhouse gas reduction objectives, including those in Title 38, section 576 576-A; 
8Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§4, ¶F, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, 
9c. 369, Pt. A, §13, is amended to read:
10F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 
11energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 
12consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 
13and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 
14funding necessary to meet those goals:
15(1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;
16(2) Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 
17to participate in and share the costs of cost-effective home weatherization to a 
18minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;
19(3) Reducing peak-load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 
20megawatts by 2020;
21(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 
2220% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 
23pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 
24section 10120;
25(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 
26efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and
27(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 
28in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals established in Title 38, 
29section 576 576-A.
30The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 
31emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 
32program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 
33may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 
34generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.
35Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 
36trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 
37as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 
38low-income weatherization programs.
39As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 
40#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 
41processes.

21-A.  Climate action plan.  "Climate action plan" means the state plan adopted under 
3this chapter.
41-B.  Gross annual greenhouse gas emissions.  "Gross annual greenhouse gas 
5emissions" means the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted by all sources within the 
6State each year.
71-C.  Net annual greenhouse gas emissions.  "Net annual greenhouse gas 
8emissions" means gross annual greenhouse gas emissions less the total amount of 
9greenhouse gases absorbed each year by plants and natural ecosystems, including, but not 
10limited to, trees, crops, soil and wetlands within the State.
11Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §576, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 237, §1, is repealed.
