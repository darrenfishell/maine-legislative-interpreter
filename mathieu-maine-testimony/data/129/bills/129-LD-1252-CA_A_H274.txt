This bill requires an additional annual snowmobile registration fee of $30 if the registrant cannot show proof of 
membership in a snowmobile club in the state. For a resident family residing in the same household in the state, the 
$30 additional registration fee is for up to 4 snowmobile registrations unless each family member can show proof of 
membership in a snowmobile club in the state. The bill directs that $20 of each additional fee collected be deposited 
into the Snowmobile Trail Fund (STF) within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF), and 
$10 be deposited into the Snowmobile Enforcement Fund (SEF) within the Depatiment of Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife (IFW). 
The IFW has indicated that it lacks a universal method of determining snowmobile club membership for snowmobile 
registrations and can only estimate the number of registrants that would choose to pay the additional registration fee 
instead of joining a snowmobile club. Using an average of 80,000 registrations per fiscal year and the assumption 
that 1/3 of those registrants would choose to pay the additional fee rather than join a snowmobile club, the fee would 
generate an estimated $792,000 annually staiiing in fiscal year 2019-20. Of this revenue, $528,000 would accrue to 
the STF within the ACF and $264,000 would accrue to the SEF within the IFW. The bill includes additional 
allocations of $528,000 to the ACF starting in fiscal year 2019-20 and $264,000 to the IFW staiiing in fiscal year 
2019-20 to allow for the expenditure of the additional revenue collected.
