SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill and adds a mandate preamble. The amendment requires that a voter provide proof 
of identity with photographic identification for the purpose of voting. The amendment 
specifies the types of photographic identification that may be used to verify the identity of 
a voter. It provides that a person who does not present photographic identification may 
cast a provisional ballot and establishes the process for provisional voting. Under this 
process, if the person can verify the person's identity to the municipal clerk, deputy clerk 
or warden or an election clerk within 3 business days of the election by presenting 
acceptable photographic identification, the ballot will be cast as a regular ballot. Through 
the general election of 2020, a person who does not present acceptable photographic 
identification but is known to a municipal clerk, registrar or election official at the voting 
place may cast a regular ballot upon submission of an affidavit by the municipal clerk, 
registrar or election official attesting to the person's identity. Finally, the amendment 
requires the Secretary of State to provide, at no fee, nondriver identification cards to
