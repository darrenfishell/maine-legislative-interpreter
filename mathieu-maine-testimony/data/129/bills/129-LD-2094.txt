3to read:
4§6201.  Short title

8to read:
9§6202.  Legislative findings and declaration of policy
10The Legislature finds and declares the following.
11The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
12Indians are asserting asserted claims for possession of large areas of land in the State and 
13for damages alleging that the lands in question originally were transferred by treaty in 
14violation of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, 1 Stat. 137, or subsequent 
15reenactments or versions thereof.
16Substantial At the time, the prospect that these claims would not be promptly 
17resolved threatened to create substantial economic and social hardship could be created 
18for large numbers of landowners, citizens and communities in the State, and therefore to 
19the State as a whole, if these claims are not resolved promptly.
20The claims also have produced disagreement between the Indian claimants and the 
21State over the extent of the state's State's jurisdiction in the claimed areas. This 
22disagreement has resulted in litigation and, if the claims are had not been resolved, further 
23litigation on jurisdictional issues would be have been likely.
24The In the late 1970s, the Indian claimants and the State, acting through the Attorney 
25General, have reached certain agreements which represent that represented a good faith 
26effort on the part of all parties to achieve a fair and just resolution of those claims which 
27that, in the absence of agreement, would be have been pursued through the courts for 
28many years to the ultimate detriment of the State and all its citizens, including the 
29Indians.  The resolution reached among the Indian claimants and the State affirmed the 
30land transfers and the reservations of rights embodied within the specific treaties that 
31gave rise to the claims at issue, and sought to definitively eliminate any prospect that the 
32claims brought by the Indian claimants would cloud private title to land in the State.
33The foregoing agreement between the Indian claimants and the State also represents a 
34good faith effort by the Indian claimants and the State to achieve a just and fair resolution 
35of their disagreement over jurisdiction on the present Passamaquoddy and Penobscot 
36Indian reservations and in the claimed areas. To that end, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and 
37the Penobscot Nation have agreed to adopt the laws of the State as their own to the extent 
Page 2 - 129LR3168(01)-11provided in this Act. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be wholly 
2subject to the laws of the State.

7powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other federally recognized Indian tribes 
8within the United States.
92.  Federal Indian law applies.  Except as otherwise specified in this chapter, federal

44purposes of this section are governed by federal statute, including, without limitation, the

13State.
144.  Double jeopardy; collateral estoppel.  A prosecution for a criminal offense or 
15juvenile crime over which the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has exclusive or

17or juvenile crime arising out of the same conduct over which the State has exclusive or

22determination of an issue of fact in a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted in a tribal 
23forum does not constitute collateral estoppel in a criminal or juvenile proceeding

27SUMMARY
28This bill implements the consensus recommendations of the Task Force on Changes 
29to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act, referred to in this summary as 
30"the task force."  The report was released on January 14, 2020 and is available online at 
31http://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf.
32This bill does not address the relationship between the State and the Aroostook Band 
33of Micmacs because that issue was specifically set aside by the task force.
34In this summary, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30, chapter 601, which is titled An 
35Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, enacted by Public Law 1979, 
36chapter 732, is referred to as the "Maine Implementing Act "and the federal Maine Indian 
37Claims Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, formerly codified at 25 United States 
38Code, Sections 1721 to 1735, is referred to as "the Settlement Act."  The federal 
39Settlement Act ratified the Maine Implementing Act, and both have an effective date of 
40October 10, 1980.
Page 34 - 129LR3168(01)-11The task force voted, in Consensus Recommendation #1, to establish an enhanced 
2process for tribal-state collaboration and consultation as well as a process for alternative 
3dispute resolution, but left the contours of those processes to be developed by 
4stakeholders.  The bill therefore does not contain language implementing this 
5recommendation, but the task force anticipated that language putting the recommendation 
6into effect would be developed during the legislative process and would be added by 
7amendment or in additional legislation.
8The Settlement Act, in Section 6(e)(1), provides federal consent for the State and the 
9Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation to agree to amend the Maine 
10Implementing Act with respect to the enforcement or application of civil, criminal or 
11regulatory laws of the tribes and the State within their respective jurisdictions, the 
12allocation or determination of governmental responsibility of the State and the tribe or 
13nation over specified subject matters or specified geographical areas, or both, including 
14provisions for concurrent jurisdiction between the State and the tribe or nation, and the 
15allocation of jurisdiction between tribal courts and state courts.  The federal law also 
16provides, in Section 6(e)(2), federal consent for the State and the Houlton Band of 
17Maliseet Indians to execute agreements regarding the jurisdiction of the State over lands 
18owned by or held in trust for the benefit of the band or its members.  The task force, 
19whose members represented the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the 
20Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs and the State, 
21exercised the opportunity offered in the Settlement Act to reconsider the relationship 
22between the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
23Indians and the State.  The statutory changes contained in this bill are the result of a 
24collaborative effort to determine how best to focus efforts to develop mutually beneficial 
25solutions that allow all of the State's citizenry, including its tribal citizenry, to prosper and 
26progress.
27The purpose of the reconsideration and rewriting of the Maine Implementing Act is to 
28establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of 
29Maliseet Indians enjoy the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities similar to 
30those of other federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States.  This is a 
31significant change from the current law, which provides the State with significant 
32authority over Indian affairs.  To carry out this significant change, many provisions of 
33chapter 601 are repealed or amended to recognize that federal Indian law governs the 
34rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of the tribe, nation and band.
35Under the bill, except as otherwise specified in the Maine Implementing Act, federal 
36Indian law applies with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of 
37the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
38Indians.  "Federal Indian law" is the body of law that applies to almost all federally 
39recognized Indian tribes, nations, bands or other groups in the United States and describes 
40their relationship with the Federal Government and the states.  Federal Indian law is 
41defined in this bill as the United States Constitution and all federal statutes and 
42regulations and subsequent amendments thereto or judicial interpretations thereof, 
43relating to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of federally recognized 
44Indian tribes within the United States, except those federally recognized Indian tribes 
45subject to United States Public Law 83-280 or a specific treaty or settlement act.  This 
Page 35 - 129LR3168(01)-11definition explicitly recognizes that federal Indian law is not static, but evolves as federal 
2laws are passed and amended and as federal courts interpret the relevant statutes and 
3regulations and their application to federally recognized Indian tribes, nations, bands and 
4other groups.  Federal Indian law addresses myriad subjects, including criminal 
5adjudicatory and legislative jurisdiction, civil adjudicatory and legislative jurisdiction, 
6taxation, the right to sue and be sued, hunting and fishing rights, regulation of natural 
7resources and land use, gaming and many other topics.
8This bill newly defines the term "tribal lands" to describe the lands of the 
9Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
10over which the tribes may exert jurisdiction as described in Consensus Recommendation 
11#2.  Passamaquoddy Tribal Lands consist of the lands designated as Passamaquoddy 
12reservation lands as well as all lands held in trust for the Passamaquoddy Tribe by the 
13United States Secretary of the Interior.  Penobscot Tribal Lands include the Penobscot 
14reservation and all lands held in trust for the Penobscot Nation by the United States 
15Secretary of the Interior.  Houlton Band Tribal Lands include all lands held in trust by the 
16United States Secretary of the Interior for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians.  In 
17addition, for each tribe, nation and band, tribal lands include land that, after the effective 
18date of this legislation, is acquired and held in trust by the United States Secretary of the 
19Interior for the respective tribe, nation or band.
20The Maine Implementing Act currently limits the criminal jurisdiction of the 
21Passamaquoddy Tribal Court and the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court as well as the 
22potential criminal jurisdiction of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court.  
23Federal Indian law provides broader jurisdiction for tribal courts.  This bill repeals most 
24of the state limitations and recognizes and adopts most of federal Indian law, including 
25the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and other 
26federal laws addressing tribal court jurisdiction and the obligations of the tribal courts.  
27This bill amends the Maine Implementing Act to make equal the exclusive criminal 
28jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy Tribal Court and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
29Tribal Court with the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court 
30over offenses committed by Indian defendants against Indian victims or for which there is 
31no victim.  This bill further amends the Maine Implementing Act to recognize the 
32criminal jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy Tribal Court, the Penobscot Nation Tribal 
33Court and the Houlton Band Tribal Court to impose the maximum penalties other tribal 
34courts are authorized to impose under the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, as 
35long as the due process protections required by that Act are observed.  This bill does not 
36include the provisions regarding tribal court concurrent jurisdiction over criminal 
37offenses committed by non-Indian defendants against Indian victims authorized under the 
38Federal Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 because this jurisdiction 
39is addressed in the 129th Legislature's L.D. 766, An Act Regarding the Penobscot 
40Nation's and Passamaquoddy Tribe's Authority to Exercise Jurisdiction under the Federal 
41Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and the Federal Violence Against Women 
42Reauthorization Act of 2013.
43This bill amends state law to recognize tribal court jurisdiction, concurrent with the 
44state courts, over offenses committed on tribal lands by Indian defendants against non-
Page 36 - 129LR3168(01)-11Indian victims, subject to the maximum penalty provisions and due process requirements 
2of the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010.
3This bill retains current law providing that the exclusive authority of the 
4Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to 
5exercise criminal jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands remains at the discretion of the 
6tribe, nation and band.  To the extent that the tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or 
7terminates its exercise of, exclusive criminal jurisdiction, the State has exclusive 
8jurisdiction over those matters.
9Unlike current law, this bill recognizes each tribal government's authority to define 
10all crimes and juvenile offenses committed on its tribal lands over which the tribal court 
11has exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction.  This bill, however, retains the authority 
12of the State to define all crimes and juvenile offenses committed on tribal lands over 
13which state courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction.
14This bill repeals the language of the Maine Implementing Act regarding the 
15procedure for members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation living in 
16their respective Indian territory to petition for an extended reservation in relation to tribal 
17court jurisdiction.  Those provisions are no longer necessary because this bill ensures that 
18the law as amended recognizes the tribe's and nation's tribal court jurisdiction to cover the 
19entirety of their tribal lands, not just reservations.
20This bill recognizes federal Indian law regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of tribes to 
21regulate fishing and hunting by tribal citizens of all federally recognized Indian tribes on 
22tribal lands.  This bill amends the Maine Implementing Act to restore and affirm the 
23exclusive jurisdiction of tribes to regulate fishing and hunting by nontribal citizens on 
24tribal lands, but does not cede to the State any authority of the Maine Indian Tribal-State 
25Commission to regulate fishing on boundary waters under current law.
26This bill relinquishes the State's jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of fishing 
27and hunting by both tribal and nontribal citizens on tribal lands.  The State, solely for 
28conservation purposes, may regulate tribal members engaged in such activities off tribal 
29lands to the extent permitted under general principles of federal Indian law and in a 
30manner consistent with reserved tribal treaty rights.
31This bill amends state law to recognize and adopt federal Indian law providing that:  
32tribes have exclusive jurisdiction to tax tribal members and tribal entities on their 
33respective tribal lands, including entities owned by a tribe or tribal member; tribes, tribal 
34members and tribal entities are not subject to state and local sales taxation on tribal lands; 
35tribal members who live on their respective tribal lands are not subject to state income tax 
36for income earned on their respective tribal lands; tribal lands are not subject to state and 
37local real property tax; tribes have concurrent jurisdiction to tax nonmembers on tribal 
38lands; and the State and local governments have concurrent jurisdiction to tax 
39nonmembers on tribal lands.
40This bill amends state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot 
41Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians the exclusive authority to exercise civil 
42legislative jurisdiction over Indians and non-Indians on tribal lands.  To the extent that 
Page 37 - 129LR3168(01)-11the tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or terminates its exercise of, exclusive civil 
2legislative jurisdiction, the State has exclusive jurisdiction over those matters.
3This bill amends state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot 
4Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians the exclusive authority to exercise civil 
5adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indians and non-Indians on tribal lands.  To the extent that 
6the tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or terminates its exercise of, exclusive civil 
7adjudicatory jurisdiction, the State has exclusive jurisdiction over those matters.
8This bill amends state law to explicitly provide that, for the purposes of the 
9Settlement Act, Section 6(h), any law or regulation of the United States that accords a 
10special status or right to, or relates to a special status or right of, any Indian, Indian 
11nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian 
12territory or land held in trust for Indians applies to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
13Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and their members and is 
14deemed not to affect or preempt the civil, criminal or regulatory jurisdiction of this State, 
15including, without limitation, laws of this State relating to land use or environmental 
16matters.  This bill amends state law to explicitly provide that for the purposes of the 
17Settlement Act, Section 16(b), the provisions of any federal law enacted after October 10, 
181980, for the benefit of Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians, apply to the 
19Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
20and their members and is deemed not to affect or preempt the application of the laws of 
21this State, including application of the laws of this State to lands owned by or held in trust 
22for Indians or Indian nations, tribes or bands of Indians, regardless of whether such 
23federal law is specifically made applicable within this State.  Although not separately 
24mentioned in the bill, the task force specifically recognized and recommended that the 
25federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Public Law 100-497, 102 Stat. 2467 (October 17, 
261990), should apply in Maine.  The portion of the bill addressing the Settlement Act, 
27Section 16(b), accomplishes this goal.  For a list of other federal statutes enacted after 
28October 10, 1980 that may be implicated by this portion of the bill, see the Report on 
29Federal Laws Enacted After October 10, 1980 for the Benefit of Indians or Indian 
30Nations, prepared by the Human Rights and Indigenous Peoples Clinic, Suffolk 
31University Law School, which is reproduced in Appendix N of the Task Force Report.
32This bill amends the Maine Implementing Act to recognize the ability of all Maine 
33tribes to acquire trust land in accordance with their settlement acts and federal laws, such 
34as the Indian Reorganization Act and its implementing regulations.  This bill amends state 
35law so that, consistent with federal Indian law, state and local governments do not have 
36veto power over trust acquisitions.  Finally, although the bill specifically preserves the 
37portions of the Maine Implementing Act relating to the resolution of the land claims that 
38led to the original enactment of the Maine Implementing Act, as the task force 
39recommends, the bill eliminates the time constraints on trust land acquisitions that are 
40included in the Maine Implementing Act.
