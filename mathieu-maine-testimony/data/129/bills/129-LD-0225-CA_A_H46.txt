Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation establishes in statute the criteria for the replacement of conventional and transit-type school buses 
through the School Bus Purchase Program within the Department of Education. Assuming that the $5,000,000 
funding level established in Title 20-A, section 5401, sub-section 15, paragraph A for the program, with certain 
exceptions, does not change, this bill is not expected to have a fiscal impact to the Department of Education or the 
program as a whole. 
Currently, the criteria for the replacement of conventional and transit-type school buses through the School Bus 
Purchase Program is established in Chapter 85: School Bus Purchase Program. This bill increases the mileage 
criteria for the purchase of conventional buses from 125,000 miles to 150,000 miles and decreases the mileage and 
age criteria for the purchase of transit-type buses from 14 years and 245,000 miles to 10 years and 150,000 miles. 
Whether the changes in this bill will impact the purchasing decisions made by local school administrative units 
(SAU's) for school buses can not be determined and will depend on each individual SAU's mix of school buses.
