10corridor identified in the petition.  The council shall review and make recommendations 
11on the likelihood, benefits and costs of potential uses of the rail corridor, including, but

12a regional transportation advisory committee established in accordance with rules adopted 
13under section 73, subsection 4, determines that removal of a specific length of rail owned 
14by the State will not have a negative impact on a region or on future economic 
15opportunities for that region, If the Commissioner of Transportation receives a report 
16from a rail corridor use advisory council established under section 75 that includes a 
17recommendation of track removal or another change to a nonrail use and the 
18commissioner concurs with that recommendation, the commissioner shall seek review by 
19legislative approval of the recommendation by submitting legislation to the joint standing 
20committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters prior to 
21removal or the other change to a nonrail use.  Legislation submitted under this section 
22must include language stating that any track removal or other nonrail use is considered 
23interim in nature and that the rail corridor will be preserved for future rail use as provided 
24under this chapter.
25SUMMARY

27use advisory council to advise and make recommendations each time one or more 
28governmental entities that represent communities along a state-owned rail corridor 
29request the Department of Transportation to review a nonrail use of that rail corridor, as 
30long as any nonrail use is considered to be interim in nature and that all such rail 
31corridors are preserved for future rail use.  Upon receiving a report from a rail corridor 
32use advisory council that recommends track removal or another change to nonrail use of 
33the rail corridor, the commissioner is required, if the commissioner concurs with the 
34recommendation, to seek legislative approval of the recommendation by submitting
