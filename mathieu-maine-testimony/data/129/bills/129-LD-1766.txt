3further amended to read:
41.  Residential construction, remodeling and renovation.  Except as provided in 
5this section, during the construction, remodeling or renovation of a multifamily 
6residential structure, a person may not install electric resistance space heating equipment 
7as the primary heating system if that construction, remodeling or renovation is funded in 
8whole or in part by public funds, guarantees or bond proceeds and the structure's 
9calculated heating load exceeds 1.3 watts per square foot per year as determined by the 
10commission by rule.  For purposes of this section, "multifamily residential structure" 
11means a residential structure with more than one dwelling unit and "electric resistance 
12space heating equipment" does not include electric thermal storage space heating 
13equipment, a high-performance air source heat pump meeting the performance standards

20program funds the proceeds of any bonds issued for the purposes of programs 
21administered by the trust.  The board may receive and shall deposit in appropriate 
22program funds revenue resulting from any forward capacity market or other capacity 
23payments from the regional transmission organization that may be attributable to those 
24projects funded by those funds, except that, from fiscal year 2019-20 to fiscal year 2024-
2525, such payments must be used to promote high-performance air source heat pump 
26technology and deposited in the Heating Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund

3promoting that goal and an estimate of the number of units that will be installed. The 
4plans must provide for coordination by the Maine State Housing Authority in its use of 
5such funds with the programs administered by the trust under this chapter.  The Maine 
6State Housing Authority shall include consider in its plans any recommendations of the 
7board to the extent the recommendations are consistent with the applicable federal 
8guidelines governing the use of the funds.

14and nonresidential spaces. "High-performance air source heat pump" means an 
15air source heat pump that satisfies minimum heating performance standards as 
16determined by the trust.
17B.  Funds from the fund may be used only for programs that provide cost-effective 
18energy efficiency and heating or weatherization measures for the benefit of heating 
19fuel customers or to efficiency service providers serving those customers and in 
20accordance with the following this paragraph.
21(1) Program categories must may include low-income, single-family and 2-family

24(2) Within program categories, the trust may differentiate between programs for 
25new construction and existing buildings; and.
26(3) Cost-effective energy efficiency measures must include measures that 
27improve the energy efficiency of energy-using systems, such as heating and 
28cooling systems, through system upgrades or conversions, including conversions 
29to energy-efficient systems that rely on renewable energy sources or systems that 
30rely on effective energy efficiency technologies.
31(4)  Eligible program measures may include, but are not limited to, training or

37except in the case of programs to deliver education, training or certifications;
38(2) A schedule of customer copayments and loan Loan options for prescribed 
39products and services. Programs, including specially designed loans for low-
40income and moderate-income consumers may provide exemptions from the 
41copayment and schedule for the purchase and installation of a high-performance 
42air source heat pump;
Page 4 - 129LR2492(01)-11(3) A plan for integrating delivery of heating fuel efficiency and weatherization 
2measures with electric efficiency measures; and
3(4) A system for the equitable allocation of costs among the contributing funds or 
4subaccounts administered by the trust when more than one efficiency opportunity 
5is identified, except that for purposes of advancing the goal of paragraph A,

17SUMMARY
18This bill establishes a goal to install 100,000 new high-performance air source heat 
19pumps in the State to provide heating in residential and nonresidential spaces.  It defines 
20"high-performance air source heat pump" as an air source heat pump that satisfies 
21minimum heating performance standards as determined by the Efficiency Maine Trust.
22The bill directs forward capacity market payments received by the Efficiency Maine 
23Trust to the Heating Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund to promote high-
24performance air source heat pumps.  It directs the Maine State Housing Authority to share 
25information with the Efficiency Maine Trust Board about the extent to which federally 
26funded weatherization programming is available to meet the heat pump goal.  It clarifies 
27that in the construction, remodeling or renovation of a multifamily residential structure 
28funded in whole or in part by public funds, guarantees or bond proceeds, high-
29performance air source heat pumps may be used as the primary heating system without 
30requiring a waiver from the Public Utilities Commission.
