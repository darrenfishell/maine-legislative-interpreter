21SUMMARY
22Current law provides that federal laws adopted after October 10, 1980 for the benefit 
23of Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians that would affect or preempt the 
24application of the laws of this State, including application of the laws of the State to lands 
25owned by or held in trust for Indians or Indian nations, tribes or bands of Indians do not 
26apply within this State unless the subsequently enacted federal law is specifically made 
27applicable within this State.
28This bill directs the Governor or the Governor's designee to maintain active 
29communications with all the members of the Maine congressional delegation about the 
30introduction of any such legislation in the United States Senate or the United States 
31House of Representatives.  The Governor or the Governor's designee is required to submit 
32a report within 10 days of the introduction of such legislation to the President of the 
33Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Attorney General and the Chair 
34of the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission.  In addition, the Governor or the 
35Governor's designee is required to submit an annual report about such legislation, 
36including its status and disposition.  The information in the reports will assist the 
37President of the Senate, Speaker of the House, Attorney General and Maine Indian 
38Tribal-State Commission in deciding how to work with the Maine congressional 
39delegation to ensure the tribes in Maine are included in federal legislation when 
40appropriate.
41This bill amends the Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement to 
42specifically state that the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation have the same 
Page 3 - 129LR1941(01)-11rights, privileges, powers and immunities as a sovereign and repeals the requirement that 
2all Indians, Indian nations and tribes and bands of Indians and any lands or other 
3resources owned or held for them are subject to the laws of Maine and to the jurisdiction 
4of Maine courts.  The bill provides the same level of immunity to the Passamaquoddy 
5Tribe and the Penobscot Tribe and their officers and employees as is enjoyed by officers 
6and employees of the State.  Finally, the bill repeals the provision of the implementing 
7Act that subjects all Indians and Indian nations or tribe or band of Indians to taxes and 
8fees.
9The changes to the implementing Act do not take effect unless approved by the 
10Governor and Council of the Penobscot Nation and the Joint Tribal Council of the 
11Passamaquoddy Tribe within 90 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of 
12the 129th Legislature.
