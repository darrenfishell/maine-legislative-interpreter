Page 1 - 129LR0266(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, many of Maine's communities are struggling to maintain or improve, or in 
4some cases are eliminating, recycling programs, and the State has not yet achieved the 
550% state recycling goal established in state law in 1989; and
6Whereas, packaging, which includes plastic, steel, aluminum, glass and cardboard, 
7constitutes approximately 30 to 40% of the materials managed by weight in waste 
8management programs in the State; and
9Whereas, Maine taxpayers currently bear 100% of the responsibility and pay an 
10estimated $16 million to $17 million each year to finance the management of packaging 
11through fragmented and increasingly expensive municipal disposal or recycling options; 
12and
13Whereas, producers of packaging have little incentive to design packaging to 
14minimize waste, reduce toxicity or maximize recyclability, and there is no organized 
15coordination between the producers of packaging and municipalities that are responsible 
16for disposing of or recycling the packaging; and
17Whereas, producers of packaging have taken some or all responsibility for the 
18management of post-consumer packaging in other parts of the world, including in all 
19European Union member states and 5 provinces in Canada, with some programs dating 
20back 30 years, and as a result have greatly increased recycling rates and infrastructure 
21investment, created jobs and reduced taxpayer costs; and
22Whereas, development of a stewardship program for packaging must be initiated 
23before the 90-day period expires in order for an extended producer responsibility law for 
24packaging to be developed and submitted in time to be considered in the next legislative 
25session; and
26Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
27the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
28immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
29therefore, be it
30Sec. 1.  Development of product stewardship law for packaging. Resolved:  
31That the Department of Environmental Protection shall develop legislation establishing 
32an extended producer responsibility law for packaging in the State. The proposed 
33legislation must, to the greatest extent practicable, adhere to the product stewardship 
34framework law established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, chapter 18 and must:
351.  Include a definition of "packaging" that covers, at a minimum, materials used to 
36wrap or protect consumer goods, including food and personal care products, and 
37containers and packaging used in the shipping, storage, protection and marketing of 
38consumer products;
Page 2 - 129LR0266(01)-112.  Include a definition of "producer" that clearly identifies the person ultimately 
2financially responsible;
33.  Include exemptions for small producers and for product packaging that is already 
4covered under Maine's beverage container redemption law;
54.  Allow producers to voluntarily participate in the program if not required by the 
6law;
75.  Provide for the establishment of a nonprofit stewardship organization of producers 
8of packaging to support the State's municipal solid waste management programs.  The 
9agreement establishing the stewardship organization must require producers to:
10A.  Cover at least 80% of the cost of recycling packaging material sold in the State 
11that is required to be recycled;
12B.  Provide per capita reimbursement payments to municipalities for nonrecyclable 
13packaging to help municipalities cover the cost of packaging needing disposal; and 
14C.  Invest in waste reduction and recycling education and infrastructure;
156.  Require that the stewardship organization establish an equitable funding scheme 
16among covered producers that encourages better packaging design in which:
17A.  Producers pay higher fees for packaging materials sold into the market that are 
18not readily recyclable, are made of multiple materials or are toxic, in order to 
19discourage the creation of materials needing disposal; and
20B.  Producers pay lower fees for packaging materials sold into the market that are of 
21higher value reusable components and that contain higher percentages of recycled 
22content to ensure that the stewardship program supports a strong recycling economy;
237.  Describe the preferred methods to be used for regular data collection and reporting 
24and recycling rate and contamination calculations in order that:
25A.  There is transparency and accountability in assessing the success of the program;
26B.  The costs of collecting and reporting data are paid for by the stewardship 
27organization; and
28C.  There is consistency with internationally accepted standards and there is sufficient 
29information to evaluate the effectiveness of the program;
308.  Create incentives for municipalities and producers to reach predetermined 
31performance goals based on reporting and data collection as described in subsection 7; 
32and
339.  Establish a method by which producers can protect themselves against producers 
34that fail to register with a program. These methods may include private right of action, 
35requirements that online retailers of packaging be responsible for paying into a fund in 
36support of the program if the products they sell are from producers who are not part of the 
37stewardship program or other strategies that ensure fairness and full compliance.
Page 3 - 129LR0266(01)-11Sec. 2.  Proposed legislation. Resolved:  That the Department of Environmental 
2Protection shall submit proposed legislation pursuant to section 1 to the Joint Standing 
3Committee on Environment and Natural Resources no later than December 16, 2019. The 
4joint standing committee is authorized to report out a bill relating to the proposal to the 
5Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.
6Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
7legislation takes effect when approved.
8SUMMARY
9This resolve requires the Department of Environmental Protection to develop 
10proposed legislation to establish a new product stewardship program requiring producers 
11of packaging to assist Maine municipalities in managing and financing packaging waste 
12disposal and recycling programs in the State. The proposed legislation is required also to 
13incentivize producers of packaging to design packaging to be recycled or made of 
14recycled content to strengthen the recycling markets. The resolve requires the department 
15to submit the proposed legislation to the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and 
16Natural Resources no later than December 16, 2019.
