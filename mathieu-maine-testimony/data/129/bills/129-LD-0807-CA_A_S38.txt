This bill removes language that prohibits the Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) from intervening in any 
proceedings in which the Public Utilities Commission is representing a position substantially similar to that of the 
Public Advocate. This removal allows the OPA to participate in additional proceedings. The bill includes annual 
allocations for the Public Advocate Regulatory Fund of $75,624 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to fund additional 
staff activities related to the proceedings. 
Because the OPA is funded by an assessment set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the 
Legislature for operating the OPA, any increased allocations require a conesponding increase in revenue to the 
Public Advocate Regulatory Fund from the assessment on the intrastate gross operating revenues of utility and 
qualified telecommunications providers.
