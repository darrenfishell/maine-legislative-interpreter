21 Governor's appointments to the Maine Charter School Commission are subject to review 
22 by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over education 
23 matters and to confirmation by the Senate. This amendment also removes the provision 
24 of the bill that ends the terms on the effective date of this legislation of members of the
