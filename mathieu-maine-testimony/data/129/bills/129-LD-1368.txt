2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5This bill proposes to require postsecondary institutions to meet the expected family 
6contribution without additional loan burdens on students.  The expected family 
7contribution is an index number that postsecondary institutions use to determine how 
8much financial aid a student would receive annually if the student were to attend that 
9postsecondary institution.  Included in financial aid packages are federal Stafford loans, 
10which are fixed-rate student loans originated by the Federal Government.  This bill is 
11designed to limit exposure of a student's loan burden to federal Stafford loans only.
