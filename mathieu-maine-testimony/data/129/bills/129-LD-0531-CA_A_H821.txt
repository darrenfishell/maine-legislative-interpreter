15SUMMARY
16 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.
17 This amendment replaces the bill.  The bill requires a probate court to appoint an 
18 attorney in all adult guardianship, conservatorship and other protective proceedings if the 
19 adult is not already represented by an attorney.
20 This amendment establishes a presumption that every adult in a guardianship, 
21 conservatorship or other protective proceeding is entitled to legal representation when not 
22 already represented and requires the court to appoint an attorney, except that the 
23 presumption may be rebutted if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 
24 adult knowingly and voluntarily refuses such representation and does not wish to contest 
25 any aspect of the proceeding or powers of the guardian or conservator or limitation to the 
26 protective arrangement.1
