($500) 
The removal of the requirement that a veterans organization register for a commercial beano hall permit to lease its 
facility to another organization registered to operate beano or bingo games will reduce revenue to the Gambling 
Control Unit within the Depaiiment of Public Safety by $500 annually beginning in fiscal year 2019-2020. Any 
additional costs to the Gambling Control Unit as a result of clarifications to the rules regarding the licensing of 
commercial beano games are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
