This bHl requires the State to pay its share of individual premiums for the state employee health insurance plan for a 
seasonal or session-only employee regardless of whether the employee is in active work status. According to the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services (OAFS), there are 351 seasonal executive branch employees, 
representing 9,105 additional weeks that state departments and agencies would need to pay health insurance 
premiums. Assuming an average cost of $270 per employee per week, executive branch departments and agencies 
would pay an additional $2,458,350 in health premiums. The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $1, 113 ,612 
in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,484,815 in fiscal year 2020-2021 and Highway Fund allocations of $215,368 in fiscal 
year 2019-20 and $287, 158 in fiscal year 2020-21 for these costs. The remaining costs will be absorbed by multiple 
funds across state government. 
The bill also includes a General Fund appropriation to the Legislature of$64,960 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $32,122 
in fiscal year 2020-21 for additional costs of providing health insurance coverage for session-only employees. Costs to 
the Legislature are slightly lower than to executive branch departments and agencies because the Legislature currently 
pays a share of health premiums for session only employees who are not in active work status. 
OAFS has indicated that it will require $54,249 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $75,531 in fiscal year 2020-21 for an 
Office Associate II position to suppoti the provisions of this bill.
