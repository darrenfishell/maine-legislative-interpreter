21 subparagraph are confidential. The Attorney General may seek an order from 
22 Superior Court compelling compliance with a summons issued under this 
23 subparagraph; and

25 when the Attorney General has reason to believe that a requirement of this section

27 authority, the actions or inactions of the agency are not supported by the record 
28 required by this section or the privatization of agency services is not in the public 
29 interest.
30 B.  After the filing of a court action under this subsection, further action by an agency 
31 under this section must be stayed unless the court orders otherwise.  During the period 
32 of the stay, any time period specified for agency action under this chapter or chapter 
33 156 is tolled until the court action is dismissed by the Attorney General or the Superior 
34 Court orders an agency to take further action.  Relief from the stay may be granted only 
35 upon a showing of compelling justification.

37 commencement of an action under this subsection, the Attorney General shall notify 
38 the agency and the commissioner of the proposed action and shall provide the 
39 commissioner and the agency an opportunity to confer with the Attorney General in

20 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section

22SUMMARY
23 This amendment replaces the bill.  The amendment sets out requirements for certain 
24 state agencies seeking to enter into a contract to privatize state services. Prior to issuing a 
25 request for proposals, an agency must determine the minimum wage rate it pays the 
26 employees providing the services, the percentage of health insurance plan coverage 
27 provided by the State for those employees and their dependents and the cost to the agency 
28 to provide the services.  All bids and subsequent privatization contracts must pay the 
29 established minimum wage rate, provide comparable health insurance coverage and pay at 
30 least the same percentage for health insurance plan coverage as paid by the agency to 
31 employees providing the services and their dependents prior to the privatization.  The bid 
32 and successful contractor must offer employment to any agency employee displaced or 
33 terminated because of the privatization of state services who meets the contractor's 
34 nondiscriminatory hiring criteria.  The amendment allows agency employees, through an 
35 employee organization, to submit a bid to provide the services.  The amendment allows an 
36 employee organization representing employees who will be displaced or terminated if the 
37 agency services are privatized to offer an amendment to the collective bargaining 
38 agreement that will lower the agency's cost to provide the services.  A privatization contract 
39 may not be executed if the total cost of the contract, including transition costs to move 
40 services from the agency to the contractor, is more than the agency's estimation of its cost 
41 to provide the services.  The amendment requires all calculations, documents and other 
42 relevant materials to be submitted to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General may 
43 choose to review the materials and may request additional information during the review. 1

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT44 The amendment grants authority to the Attorney General to intervene at any stage of the 
45 privatization process.  The amendment also gives an employee organization the authority 
46 to request a review of the written statement prepared by the agency seeking to privatize 
47 services.  The Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services is required to 
48 provide a response to such a request within 15 business days, and the decision is considered 
49 final agency action for purposes of judicial review. The amendment retains the Attorney 
50 General's authority to bring an action to prevent or enjoin privatization in appropriate cases.
8 The amendment also establishes the State Procurement Review Committee to oversee 
9 contracts, grants, amendments, renewals and requests for proposals valued over 
10 $1,000,000.  The Office of the Attorney General must be consulted when the value equals 
11 or exceeds $3,000,000.
