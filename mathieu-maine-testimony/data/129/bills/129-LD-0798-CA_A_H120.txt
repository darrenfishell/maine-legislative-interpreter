28 SUMMARY 
29 Current law allows exemptions from immunization requirements based on religious 
30 or philosophical beliefs for students in elementary and secondary schools and 
31 postsecondary schools and employees of nursery schools and health care facilities. This 
32 amendment, which is the majority report, removes those exemptions effective September 
33 1, 2021. 
34 Current law relating to emollment in any public or private elementary or secondary 
35 school provides that the superintendent may not permit any child to be emolled in or to 
36 attend school without a certificate of immunization for each disease or other acceptable 
37 evidence of required immunization or immunity against the disease except when the 
38 parent or child provides a physician's written statement that immunization against one or 
39 more of the diseases may be medically inadvisable. Instead, the amendment requires the 
40 parent or child to provide a written statement from a licensed physician, nurse practitioner 
41 or physician assistant that, in that physician's, nurse practitioner's or physician assistant's

7 disease except when the parent or the student provides a physician's written statement or a

22 practitioner or physician assistant has provided information on the risks and benefits
