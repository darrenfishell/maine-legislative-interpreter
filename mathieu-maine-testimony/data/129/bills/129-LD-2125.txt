28SUMMARY
29The purpose of this bill is to align the marijuana possession and transfer limitations 
30between the laws governing adult use marijuana and the laws governing marijuana for 
31medical use.  This bill removes language in the adult use marijuana laws that authorizes 
32the use, possession, transport, transfer, furnishing or purchase of 2 1/2 ounces of a 
33combination of marijuana and marijuana concentrate that includes no more than 5 grams 
34of marijuana concentrate and instead limits the permissible amount to 2 1/2 ounces of 
35marijuana.
