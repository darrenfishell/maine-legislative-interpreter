13set in paragraph A to the extent necessary to provide coverage to as many 
14children as possible within the fiscal constraints of the program budget.  If Cub 
15Care program expenditures are reasonably anticipated to exceed the program 
16budget after raising the maximum eligibility level pursuant to this subparagraph, 
17the commissioner may lower the maximum eligibility level to the level 
18established in paragraph A.
19(4)  The commissioner shall give at least 30 days' notice of the proposed change
