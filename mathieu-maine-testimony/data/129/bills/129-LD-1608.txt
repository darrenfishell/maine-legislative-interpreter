Page 1 - 129LR2243(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, currently, trailers that are manufactured and purchased in Maine and 
4transported out of the State are subject to the sales and use tax; and
5Whereas, this places manufacturers of trailers at a disadvantage with manufacturers 
6of trailers in other states that do not impose a sales tax on trailers; and
7Whereas, in order to avoid continuing this inequity any longer, it is important that 
8this legislation take effect as soon as possible; and 
9Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
11immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
12therefore,
13Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
14Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §1760, sub-§23-C, ¶C, as amended by PL 2011, c. 380, Pt. 
15GGGG, §1, is further amended to read:
16C.  Aircraft, if the property is an aircraft not exempted under subsection 88-A; and
17Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1760, sub-§23-C, ¶E, as amended by PL 2015, c. 300, Pt. A, 
18§17, is further amended to read:
19E.  Camper trailers, including truck campers, other than those that are being leased 
20for a period of less than one year.; and
21Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §1760, sub-§23-C, ¶F is enacted to read:
22F.  Trailers.  For purposes of this paragraph, "trailer" does not include a camper 
23trailer.
24Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
25legislation takes effect when approved.
26SUMMARY
27This bill provides an exemption from the sales and use tax for trailers that are 
28purchased in the State but then driven or transported outside the State immediately upon 
29delivery.  The exemption excludes camper trailers, which are included in the definition of 
30"trailer," since a similar exemption already exists for camper trailers, other than those that 
31are being leased for a period of less than one year.
