24SUMMARY
25The purpose of this bill is to enhance access to public records without imposing 
26undue burdens on the efficient and effective functioning of government.  This bill makes 
27the following changes to the Freedom of Access Act.
281.  Current law defines public records that are subject to the Freedom of Access Act 
29as matter in the possession or custody of an agency or public official that has been 
30received or prepared for use in connection with, or that contains information relating to, 
31the transaction of public or governmental business. This bill defines "public or 
32governmental business" as the administration of public policy and the exercise of 
33governmental power through laws, rules, ordinances, regulations and the equivalent.
342.  The bill requires that, when requesting to inspect or to receive a copy of a public 
35record, a person must provide to the agency or official with custody of the record 
36sufficient information to identify the record sought.  Under the bill, a request for a public 
37record must include, at a minimum, the specific subject matter contained in the record 
38and the date or dates upon which the record was created or a range of dates within which 
39the record may have been created.
Page 3 - 129LR0125(01)-113.  Current law requires that, within "a reasonable time" of receiving a request for 
2information, the agency or official must provide a good faith, nonbinding estimate of the 
3time within which the agency or official will comply.  This bill instead requires that the 
4agency or official, within 30 days of receiving the request, provide to the requester an 
5update on progress on the request and, within 30 days of providing the update, fulfill the 
6request.  If the agency or official is unable to fulfill the entirety of the request within the 
7specified time period, the agency or official must provide to the requester an explanation 
8of the reason or reasons it was unable to comply, fulfill those portions of the request that 
9it can fulfill and provide a written estimate of the expected date of compliance with the 
10remainder of the request.
114.  The bill directs the Right To Know Advisory Committee to examine the specific 
12challenges of ensuring public access to public records in the face of new and emerging 
13technologies and to develop recommendations that are designed to preserve 
14communications that can be accessed by the public.  The Right To Know Advisory 
15Committee is directed to report its findings and recommendations to the Joint Standing 
16Committee on Judiciary, which is authorized to report out a bill to the Second Regular 
17Session of the 129th Legislature.
