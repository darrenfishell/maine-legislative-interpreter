Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $1,000 in fiscal year 2019-20. An estimated $6,190 is 
available in each of fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 in the Legislature's proposed budget for legislative studies as 
well as any balances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will 
depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the Department of Corrections to be a member of the Working Group on Mental Health and to 
the Department of Health and Human Services to be a member of and staff the Working Group are expected to be 
minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
