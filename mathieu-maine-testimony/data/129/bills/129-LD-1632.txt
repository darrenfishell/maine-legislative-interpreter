Page 1 - 129LR2136(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §38, as enacted by PL 1981, c. 324, §14, is amended by 
3adding at the end a new paragraph to read:
4An actor does not suffer from an abnormal condition of the mind based solely on the 
5discovery of, knowledge about or potential disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived 
6gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation, including under 
7circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual 
8advance toward the actor or in which the actor and victim dated or had a romantic or 
9sexual relationship.
10Sec. 2.  17-A MRSA §108, sub-§3 is enacted to read:
113.  A person is not justified in using force against another based solely on the 
12discovery of, knowledge about or potential disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived 
13gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation, including under 
14circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual 
15advance toward the person or in which the person and victim dated or had a romantic or 
16sexual relationship.
17Sec. 3.  17-A MRSA §201, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2001, c. 383, §8 and 
18affected by §156, is further amended to read:
194.    For purposes of subsection 3, provocation is adequate if: 
20A.  It is not induced by the person; and
21B.  It is reasonable for the person to react to the provocation with extreme anger or 
22extreme fear, provided that evidence demonstrating only that the person has a 
23tendency towards extreme anger or extreme fear is not sufficient, in and of itself, to 
24establish the reasonableness of the person's reaction.
25For purposes of determining whether extreme anger or extreme fear was brought about by 
26adequate provocation, the provocation was not adequate if it resulted solely from the 
27discovery of, knowledge about or potential disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived 
28gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation, including under 
29circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual 
30advance toward the person or in which the person and victim dated or had a romantic or 
31sexual relationship.
32SUMMARY
33This bill prohibits the use of what is referred to as the "gay and trans panic defense."
34The bill provides that when considering whether a defendant has an abnormal 
35condition of the mind in determining whether a requisite culpable mental state exists in 
36the defendant, a determination of abnormal condition of the mind may not be based on 
37the defendant's discovery of, knowledge about or potential disclosure of the victim's 
38actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation, 
Page 2 - 129LR2136(01)-11including under circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible 
2romantic or sexual advance toward the defendant or under circumstances in which the 
3defendant and victim dated or had a romantic or sexual relationship.
4The bill excludes from the affirmative defense for murder that the defendant acted on 
5the basis of extreme anger or extreme fear based on provocation by prohibiting the 
6alleged cause of provocation from being solely from the discovery of, knowledge about 
7or potential disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender 
8expression or sexual orientation, including under circumstances in which the victim made 
9an unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual advance toward the defendant or under 
10circumstances in which the defendant and victim dated or had a romantic or sexual 
11relationship.
12The bill provides that a person's discovery of, knowledge about or potential 
13disclosure of the victim's actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression 
14or sexual orientation, including under circumstances in which the victim made an 
15unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual advance toward the defendant or under 
16circumstances in which the defendant and victim dated or had a romantic or sexual 
17relationship, may not be used as the sole justification for the use of force against the 
18victim.
