4 food package in lieu of identified alternatives. If an assessment acceptable to the 
5 department is not timely submitted. the department may assess a fee on the 
6 manufacturer or distributor to cover the costs to prepare an independent report on the 
7 availability of safer alternatives by a contractor of the department's choice.

18 SUMMARY 
19 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the bill as 
20 follows. 
21 1. It clarifies that the sales prohibitions on food packaging containing intentionally 
22 introduced perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PF AS, and phthalates in any 
23 amount greater than an incidental presence applies only to sales occurring in the State and 
24 clarifies the scope of the exemption to those prohibitions for certain manufacturers of 
25 food or beverage products. 
26 2. It provides that any rulemaking by the Department of Environmental Protection to 
27 prohibit the sale of food packaging containing intentionally introduced PF AS is major 
28 substantive rulemaking and requires the department to adopt by rule such a prohibition 
29 upon a determination that a safer alternative to the use of PF AS in a specific application 
30 of PF AS to a food package is available. 
31 3. It removes from the bill the provisions authorizing the department to designate by 
32 rule additional chemicals of concern in food packaging and instead enacts a new chapter 
33 to regulate the use of additional toxic chemicals in food packaging. That new chapter is 
34 modeled after the toxic chemicals in children's products law in the Maine Revised 
35 Statutes, Title 38, chapter 16-D and incorporates the definitions and criteria from that law 
36 into the new chapter, as adapted for application to food packaging. 
37 4. It includes a number of technical changes to the bill as necessary to incorporate 
38 the other amendments to the bill described in this summary.
