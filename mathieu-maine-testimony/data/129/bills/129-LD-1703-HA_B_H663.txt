Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
This bill may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional filing fees may increase General Fund and other dedicated revenue by minor amounts_. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment replaces the bill and various amendments but incorporates the substance of them except for striking a 
provision that makes it unlawful public accommodations discrimination under the Maine Human Rights Act for any 
public entity to discriminate on the basis of a protected class. Removing that provision does not significantly change 
the fiscal impact described above. Any additional costs to the Maine Human Rights Commission due to an increase in 
complaints filed are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
