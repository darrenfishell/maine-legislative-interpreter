Fiscal Note 
Cmrent biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill establishes a wholesale importation program for prescription drugs from Canada by or on behalf of the State 
in order to provide cost savings to consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would require 
significant funds to hire new staff to administer the program, contract with a third party wholesaler, find suitable 
premises, either leased or state-owned, to store prescription drugs and other costs unknown at this time. It is expected 
that there will be some savings on prescription drugs in the MaineCare program, which will be offset slightly by a 
reduction in the rebates received for prescription drugs. As the program design is left to the DHHS's rulemaking 
process and the request for federal certification, no estimate of the cost of the program is made at this time.
