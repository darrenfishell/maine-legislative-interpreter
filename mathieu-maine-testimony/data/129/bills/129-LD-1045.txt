3SUMMARY
4Current law prohibits a person from making a bad faith assertion of patent 
5infringement against another person.  A person who does make a bad faith assertion may 
6have to pay remedies awarded by the court, including equitable relief, damages, costs and 
7fees and punitive damages; however, the law exempts persons seeking relief pursuant to 
835 United States Code, Section 271(e)(2) or 42 United States Code, Section 262 from the 
9law prohibiting bad faith assertions of patent infringement, which may include businesses 
10such as pharmaceutical companies.  This bill removes the exemption.
