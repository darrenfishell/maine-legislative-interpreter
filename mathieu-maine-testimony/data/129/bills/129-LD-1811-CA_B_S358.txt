(5) A court shall electronically update or transmit to the Department of Public 
Safety, Bureau of State Police an abstract of the order issued by the court 
pursuant to this section that includes a prohibition on the possession of a 
dangerous weapon. The abstract must include the name, date of birth and gender 
of the person who is the subject of the order: the court's order and the expiration 
date of that order: and a notation that the person has been notified by the court. 
The abstract required by this subparagraph is confidential and is not a public 
record as defined in Title 1, chapter 13: however, the information contained in 
the abstract or a copy of the abstract may be provided by the Department of 
Public Safety to a criminal justice agency for law enforcement purposes, to the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Instant Criminal Background Check 
System or to an issuing authority for the purpose of processing concealed firearm 
permit applications. The Department of Public Safety shall, when the pertinent 
database is developed, request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ensure 
that, immediately after the order expires, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System no longer reflects that expired order as a ground for 
prohibiting the subject of the order from possessing or acquiring a firearm. For 
the purposes of this subsection, "criminal justice agency" means a federal, state, 
tribal, district, county or local government agency or any subunit of those entities 
that performs the administration of criminal justice under a statute or executive 
order and that allocates a substantial part of its annual budget to the

General are considered criminal justice agencies, as is any equivalent agency at 
any level of Canadian government.

arrangements with another law enforcement agency or federally licensed firearms dealer 
to store, any weapon surrendered to or seized by law enforcement under this section for 
as long as the threat-based restrictions are in effect. The duties and liability of a law 
enforcement agency with respect to handling and storage of a weapon surrendered or 
seized are governed by Title 25, section 2804-C, subsection 2-C. A weapon surrendered 
to or seized by a law enforcement agency must be returned to the restricted person when 
the threat-based restrictions expire. If a seized or surrendered weapon remains unclaimed 
for 6 months after the expiration or dissolution of threat-based restrictions, the law 
enforcement agency may dispose of the weapon consistent with Title 25, section 3503-A. 
8. Offense. Possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person is a Class D 
crime.

6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment is the minority report. 
8 This amendment replaces the bill but retains the pwpose of providing an alternative 
9 to law enforcement to take into protective custody and have assessed a person who 
10 presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm to the person or to others. 
11 First, it authorizes a law enforcement officer to take a person into protective custody 
12 on probable cause to believe that the person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm. 
13 Second, it provides that the assessments qualify for the same payment of private or 
14 public insurance applicable to assessments under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, 
15 section 3863. 
16 "Likelihood of foreseeable harm" is defined as a substantial risk in the foreseeable 
17 future of serious physical harm to the person as manifested by recent behaviors or threats 
18 of, or attempts at, suicide or serious self-inflicted harm; or a substantial risk in the 
19 foreseeable future of serious physical harm to other persons as manifested by recent 
20 homicidal or violent behavior or by recent conduct or statements placing others in 
21 reasonable fear of serious physical harm. 
22 The law enforcement officer is directed to have the person in protective custody 
23 assessed by a medical practitioner. If the assessment finds that the person presents a 
24 likelihood of foreseeable harm, the law enforcement officer must seek an endorsement 
25 from a judicial officer that the person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm, which 
26 authorizes law enforcement to notify the person that the person is a restricted person and 
27 is prohibited from possessing, controlling, acquiring or attempting to possess, control or 
28 acquire a dangerous weapon pending the outcome of a judicial hearing. The restricted 
29 person must immediately and temporarily surrender any weapon possessed, controlled or 
30 acquired by the restricted person to a law enforcement officer. 
31 A restricted person who makes all practical and immediate efforts to comply with a 
32 surrender notice is not subject to arrest or prosecution as a prohibited person under the 
33 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraph E-1 or E-2. If a 
34 law enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the restricted person possesses or 
35 controls but has not surrendered a weapon, law enforcement may, prior to or as part of a 
36 judicial hearing, search for and seize such a weapon when authorized by a judicially 
37 issued warrant or other circumstances approved by law. 
38 The district attorney is required to file a petition for judicial review of the initial 
39 restrictions by the District Court. Within 14 days of the notice of restricted status given 
40 to the restricted person, the court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether to 
41 dissolve or extend the initial restrictions. The restricted person has the right to be 
42 represented by counsel. The district attorney has the burden of proving by clear and

convincing evidence that the restricted person presents a likelihood of foreseeable harm. 
The court may dissolve the initial restrictions or extend them for up to one year. 
This amendment directs the executive branch to work with medical practitioners and 
law enforcement to develop and release, by January 1, 2020, a request for proposals for 
the development and acquisition of the technology necessary to enable assessments under 
Title 34-B, section 3862-A at locations other than health care facilities. 
By February 1, 2020, the Department of Public Safety must develop a plan, including 
any cost estimates, to implement a database system to support this legislation. 
The provisions for assessments for likelihood of foreseeable harm and restricted 
person status take effect July 1, 2020.

Current biennium cost increase -Highway Fund 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
This bill may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional filing fees may increase General Fund and other dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The Department of Public Safety will require a General Fund appropriation and a Highway Fund allocation in fiscal 
year 2020-21 for programming changes and annual maintenance to create a database to record information related to 
persons in protective custody who are restricted from access to dangerous weapons. The department will need to work 
with the vendor to develop and implement the new system. The costs are unknown at this time and no estimate is 
made.
