Page 1 - 129LR1006(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §1055, sub-§10, as amended by PL 2011, c. 635, Pt. A, §1, 
3is further amended to read:
410.  Supervise school employees.  The superintendent is responsible for 
5implementing a performance evaluation and professional growth system for all teachers 
6and principals pursuant to chapter 508 and an evaluation system for all other employees 
7of the school administrative unit.  The superintendent shall evaluate probationary teachers 
8during, but not limited to, their 2nd year of employment, except that the superintendent 
9shall evaluate teachers who completed 3 years of a probationary period in another school 
10administrative unit during their first year of employment.  The method of evaluation must 
11be determined by the school board, be in compliance with the requirements of chapter 
12508 and be implemented by the superintendent.
13Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §13201, as amended by PL 2017, c. 235, §36 and affected by 
14§41, is further amended to read:
15§13201.  Nomination and election of teachers; teacher contracts
16The superintendent shall nominate all teachers, subject to such regulations governing 
17salaries and the qualifications of teachers as the school board makes.  Upon the approval 
18of nominations by the school board, the superintendent may employ teachers so 
19nominated and approved for such terms as the superintendent determines proper, subject 
20to the approval of the school board.  Prior to May 15th before the expiration of a first, 2nd 
21or 3rd year probationary teacher's contract, the superintendent shall notify the teacher in 
22writing of the superintendent's decision to nominate or not nominate that teacher for 
23another teaching contract.  For a teacher who completed 3 years of a probationary period 
24in a school administrative unit and is later employed by another school administrative 
25unit, the superintendent shall notify the teacher in writing of the superintendent's decision 
26to nominate or not nominate that teacher for another teaching contract prior to May 15th 
27before the expiration of the first year of that teacher's contract.  If, after receiving a 
28complaint from a teacher, the commissioner finds that the superintendent has failed to 
29notify a teacher of a decision not to nominate that teacher, the school administrative unit 
30shall pay a forfeiture to the teacher.  The amount of that forfeiture must be equal to the 
31teacher's per diem salary rate times the number of days between the notification deadline 
32and the date on which notification is made or on which the complaint is filed, whichever 
33occurs first.  In case the superintendent of schools and the school board fail to legally 
34elect a teacher, the commissioner has the authority to appoint a substitute teacher who 
35serves until such election is made.
36After a probationary period of 3 years or one year for teachers who completed 3 years 
37of a probationary period in a school administrative unit and are later employed by another 
38school administrative unit, subsequent contracts of duly certified teachers must be for not 
39less than 2 years.  Unless a duly certified teacher receives written notice to the contrary at 
40least 6 months before the terminal date of the contract, the contract must be extended 
41automatically for one year and similarly in subsequent years, except for duly certified 
42teachers who received a summative effectiveness rating indicating ineffectiveness 
Page 2 - 129LR1006(01)-11pursuant to chapter 508 for the preceding school year.  The right to an extension for a 
2longer period of time through a new contract is specifically reserved to the contracting 
3parties.  Unless a duly certified teacher who received a summative effectiveness rating 
4indicating ineffectiveness pursuant to chapter 508 for the preceding school year receives 
5written notice to the contrary from the superintendent not later than May 15th, the 
6contract must be extended automatically for one year.
7Just cause for dismissal or nonrenewal is a negotiable item in accordance with the 
8procedure set forth in Title 26, chapter 9-A for teachers who have served beyond the 
9probationary period.
10After a the probationary period of 3 years, any teacher who receives notice in 
11accordance with this section that the teacher's contract is not going to be renewed may 
12during the 15 days following such notification request a hearing with the school board.  
13The teacher may request reasons.  The hearing must be private except by mutual consent 
14and except that either or both parties may be represented by counsel.  That hearing must 
15be granted within 30 days of the receipt of the teacher's request.
16The right to terminate a contract, after due notice of 90 days, is reserved to the school 
17board when changes in local conditions warrant the elimination of the teaching position 
18for which the contract was made. The order of layoff and recall is a negotiable item in 
19accordance with the procedures set forth in Title 26, chapter 9-A.  In any negotiated 
20agreement, the criteria negotiated by the school board and the bargaining agent to 
21establish the order of layoff and recall must include the teacher's effectiveness rating 
22pursuant to chapter 508 as a factor and may also include, but may not be limited to, 
23seniority.
24SUMMARY
25This bill provides that if a teacher completed a 3-year probationary period in a school 
26administrative unit and later teaches in another school administrative unit, that teacher 
27will only have a one-year probationary period in the new school administrative unit.
