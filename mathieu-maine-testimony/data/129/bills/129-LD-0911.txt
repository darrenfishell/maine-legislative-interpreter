Page 1 - 129LR0916(01)-11Preamble.  Two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature deeming it necessary in 
2accordance with the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 14 to authorize the 
3issuance of bonds on behalf of the State of Maine to provide funds as described in this 
4Act,
5Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
6Sec. 1.  Authorization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized, under the 
7direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
8amount not exceeding $95,000,000 for the purposes described in section 6 of this Act.  
9The bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for 
10a period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
11Sec. 2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State 
12shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the 
13name of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of 
14sale and the date when payable.
15Sec. 3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of State 
16may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be 
17loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
18bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
19upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
20forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
21in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
22general obligation bonds.
23Sec. 4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay interest 
24due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Act and all sums coming due for payment 
25of bonds at maturity.
26Sec. 5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds.    The proceeds of the bonds must be 
27expended as set out in this Act under the direction and supervision of the Department of 
28Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
291. The proceeds of the bonds for the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
30section 6 must be expended by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
31for acquisition of land and interest in land for conservation, water access, outdoor 
32recreation, wildlife or fish habitat, farmland preservation in accordance with the 
33provisions for such acquisitions under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 
34and working waterfront preservation in accordance with the terms of Public Law 2005, 
35chapter 462, Part B, section 6, including all costs associated with such acquisitions, 
36except that use of the proceeds of these bonds is subject to the following conditions and 
37requirements.
38A. Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on land 
39acquired with bond proceeds, except to the extent of applicable state, local or federal 
Page 2 - 129LR0916(01)-11laws, rules and regulations and except for working waterfront projects and farmland 
2protection projects.
3B. Payment from bond proceeds for acquisitions of local or regional significance, as 
4determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board, may be made directly to 
5cooperating entities as defined in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2 for acquisition of 
6land and interest in land by cooperating entities, subject to terms and conditions 
7enforceable by the State to ensure its use for the purposes of this Act. In addition to 
8the considerations required under Title 5, chapter 353, the board shall give a 
9preference to acquisitions under this paragraph that achieve benefits for multiple 
10towns and that address regional conservation needs including public recreational 
11access, wildlife, open space and farmland.
12C. The bond funds expended for conservation, recreation, working waterfronts, 
13farmland and water access must be matched with at least $75,000,000 in public and 
14private contributions. Seventy percent of that amount must be in the form of cash or 
15other tangible assets, including the value of land and real property interest acquired 
16by or contributed to cooperating entities, as defined in Title 5, section 6201, 
17subsection 2, when property interests have a direct relationship to the property 
18proposed for protection, as determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board. The 
19remaining 30% may be matching contributions and may include the value of project-
20related, in-kind contributions of goods and services to and by cooperating entities.
21D. Because portions of the State have deer populations that are struggling and deer 
22wintering habitat protection is vital to the survival and enhancement of these 
23populations, projects that conserve and protect deer wintering areas are considered to 
24have special value and must receive preferential consideration during scoring of new 
25applications for support under Title 5, chapter 353.
26E. To the extent the purposes are consistent with the disbursement provisions in this 
27Act, 100% of the bond proceeds may be considered as state match for any federal 
28funding to be made available to the State.
292. The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of 
30Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall take a proactive approach to pursuing land 
31conservation projects that include conservation of priority deer wintering areas. Priority 
32deer wintering areas are of at least 500 acres or contiguous with existing conservation 
33land so that the combined acreage constitutes at least 500 acres, have been historically 
34used by deer at some point since 1950 and are capable of providing shelter for deer on the 
35effective date of this Act or within 20 years. The Department of Inland Fisheries and 
36Wildlife shall include in conservation negotiations under this section provisions for the 
37appropriate management of priority deer wintering areas. Land and interest in land 
38purchased by the State that contains priority deer wintering areas must be managed using 
39protocol provided by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
403. Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board, at least 5% 
41must be made available to acquire public access to water in accordance with Title 5, 
42section 6203-A.
Page 3 - 129LR0916(01)-114. Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board, at least 10% 
2must be made available to protect farmland in accordance with Title 5, section 6207.
35. Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine's Future Board, at least 10% 
4must be made available to protect working waterfront properties in accordance with 
5Public Law 2005, chapter 462, Part B, section 6.
6Sec. 6.  Disbursement of bond proceeds from General Fund bond issue.  
7The proceeds of the sale of the bonds authorized under this Act must be expended as
