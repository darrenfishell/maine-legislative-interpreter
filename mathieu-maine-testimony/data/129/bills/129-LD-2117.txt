29SUMMARY
30This bill amends the provisions of law governing the Controlled Substances 
31Prescription Monitoring Program to require dispensers to report all prescription drugs 
32dispensed intended for human consumption rather than controlled substances only, 
33allowing the program database to be used for medication reconciliation and other patient 
34safety activities.  The enhanced program allows pharmacists and all prescribers to obtain 
35a complete record of all medication prescribed to a patient, identifying the prescriber for 
36each drug and listing the dates on which each prescription was filled.  This information 
37gives health care providers additional means to ensure that patients do not have adverse 
Page 5 - 129LR3170(01)-11reactions due to incompatible drug interactions or overprescribing of medications from 
2multiple prescribers.  The program name is changed to the Prescription Monitoring 
3Program to reflect its wider scope.  The bill also directs the Department of Health and 
4Human Services to apply for federal funds and seek other funding sources to develop the 
5improvements to the program.
