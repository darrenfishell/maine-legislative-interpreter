Allowing civilian employees employed in the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory or computer crimes unit within 
the Department of Public Safety on or after July 1, 2020 to patticipate in the 1998 Special Plan of the Maine Public 
Employees Retirement System will increase both the nonnal cost and unfunded actuarial liability components of the 
employer retirement rate, resulting in increased employer contributions to the Maine Public Employees Retirement 
System (MainePERS) on behalf of civilian employees beginning in fiscal year 2020-21. 
This legislation includes a transition provision for those eligible civilian employees hired by the Depaitment of Public 
Safety prior to July 1, 2020 which allows them to elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan by September 30, 2020. 
An analysis provided by MainePERS identified 17 eligible civilian employees that may elect to participate in the 1998 
Special Plan as soon as the option becomes available. Given this analysis, this bill includes a General Fund 
appropriation of $28,883, a Highway Fund allocation of $5,097 and a Federal Expenditures Fund allocation of $5,306 
in fiscal year 2020-21 to the State Police program for the cost associated with moving the positions to the 1998 
Special Plan. Additionally, this bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $8,596 in fiscal year 2020-21 to the 
Computer Crimes program. 
If any of the eligible civilian employees hired by the Department of Public Safety prior to July 1, 2020 who choose to 
remain in the State Regular Plan eventually retire or otherwise vacate their positions, any newly hired employees will 
be placed in the 1998 Special Plan. The additional cost to the department to fill these positions at the higher employer 
contribution rate is estimated to be between $2,000 and $3,000 per position annually. When this additional cost will 
be incun-ed and which fund will be impacted cannot be detennined at this time.
