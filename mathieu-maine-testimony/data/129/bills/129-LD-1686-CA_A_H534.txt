Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law prevents a certified Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) candidate from using MCEA funding to pay any 
expenditures for a recount. This bill allows such a candidate to use previously distributed MCEA funds for the cost of 
eligible recount expenditures if a recount is requested by the candidate's opponent. To the extent that any MCEA 
funding is used for recount expenditures going forward, the amount of unused MCEA funding returned by candidates 
after an election is completed will be less than what would have been returned without this legislation. No estimate is 
made of the amount ofMCEA funding that will be used for recount expenditures.
