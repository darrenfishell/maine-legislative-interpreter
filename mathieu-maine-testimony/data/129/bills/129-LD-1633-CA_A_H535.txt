This bill authorizes historical instant racing and keno and directs that 10% of the net income from historical instant 
racing and keno be deposited into the General Fund and that 1 % be retained by the Gambling Control Board for 
administrative expenses. Applicants for a historical instant racing and keno license are required to pay a one-time 
application fee of $5,000 and an annual renewal fee of $5,000. License fees are estimated to generate $35,000 in 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue annually. 
The bill includes appropriations of $1,302,064 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,810,303 in fiscal year 2020-21 for 14 
Public Safety Inspector I positions, 7 Public Safety Inspector III positions and one Public Safety Manager II position 
and associated All Other costs. General Fund revenue of $2,107,875 is estimated to be generated annually from 
instant historical racing. This assumes that 7 locations will operate 100 instant racing machines with a win average 
of $75 per day. While the bill also authorizes keno, the bill does not specify the number of games per time frame, 
wager limits or location criteria to operate keno games. This fiscal note includes an estimate of $200,000 in annual 
General Fund revenue from keno starting in fiscal year 2019-20, with the assumption that future revenue estimates 
will be adjusted once the regulatory structure of keno has been decided through rulemaldng.
