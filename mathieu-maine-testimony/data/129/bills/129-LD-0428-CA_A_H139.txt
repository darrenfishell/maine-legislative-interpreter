The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of$1,238,310 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,201,845 in fiscal year 2020-21 to provide at least one week of training to new employees 
engaged in adult protective services (APS), to ensure that the ratio of supervisory positions to caseworker positions in 
APS and child protective services (CPS) is identical and to provide funding for the recruitment and retention of 
certain employees in APS positions with a $5 per wage-hour stipend payment and a $1 per wage-hour stipend 
payment for employees holding or obtaining a relevant master's degree. 
The bill as originally drafted included 2 additional supervisor positions in APS to achieve the same ratio as CPS. 
However, the current ratio of supervisors to caseworkers in CPS is 4 to 1 and the current ratio for APS is 6 to 1. This 
requires an additional 4 supervisors in APS to reach the 4 to 1 ratio.
