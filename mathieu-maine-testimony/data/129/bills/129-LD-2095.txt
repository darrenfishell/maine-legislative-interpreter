13on a formulary, the carrier offering that health plan, subject to the limitations set forth in 
14subsection 4:
15A.  Shall include on the formulary at least one generic drug or biosimilar that has a

18generic drug or biosimilar is a specialty pharmaceutical;
19B.  Shall include on the formulary each generic drug or biosimilar that is a specialty 
20pharmaceutical if the formulary includes the branded pharmaceutical reference 
21product for the generic drug or biosimilar and the generic drug or biosimilar has a 
22lower wholesale acquisition cost than its branded pharmaceutical reference product;
23C.  May not impose any limitation on coverage of or enrollee access to a generic drug 
24or biosimilar for which formulary placement is required under paragraph A or B that:
25(1) Is more restrictive than any limitation applicable to the branded 
26pharmaceutical reference product for that generic drug or biosimilar if that 
27branded pharmaceutical reference product is included on the formulary;
28(2)  Has the effect of favoring the branded pharmaceutical product; or
29(3)  Restricts the pharmacies through which enrollees may obtain the generic 
30drug or biosimilar that is not also applicable to the branded pharmaceutical 
31reference product; and
32D.  With respect to any generic drug or biosimilar that is a specialty pharmaceutical 
33and has a lower wholesale acquisition cost than the wholesale acquisition cost of its 
34branded pharmaceutical reference product, if neither the generic drug or biosimilar 
35nor its branded pharmaceutical reference product is included on the health plan's 
36formulary, may not impose any requirement for coverage of that generic drug or 
37biosimilar as an exception to the formulary that is more restrictive than the 
38requirements for coverage of the branded pharmaceutical reference product as an 
39exception to the formulary.
403.  Cost-sharing requirements.  Except as provided in subsection 4, if a health plan 
41offered by a carrier in this State provides coverage for prescription drugs using a tiered 
42formulary cost-sharing arrangement:
Page 3 - 129LR2892(01)-11A.  For each generic drug and biosimilar for which coverage is required under 
2subsection 2, paragraph A, the carrier offering the health plan shall provide coverage 
3on a generic cost-sharing tier; and
4B.  For each generic drug and biosimilar that is a specialty pharmaceutical and for 
5which coverage is required under subsection 2, paragraph B, the carrier offering the 
6health plan shall provide coverage at a meaningfully lower cost-sharing amount than 
7the cost-sharing amount provided for the branded pharmaceutical reference product 
8for that generic drug or biosimilar.
94.  Application; limitations.  The requirements set forth in subsections 2 and 3:
10A.  Apply only with respect to coverage of and cost-sharing for generic drugs, 
11biosimilars and branded pharmaceuticals when dispensed by pharmacies as outpatient 
12prescription drugs and do not apply to generic drugs, biosimilars or branded 
13pharmaceuticals when provided by a hospital, physician or other provider of health 
14care or palliative services, other than a pharmacy, incident to the services of that 
15provider and paid for by or on behalf of the relevant health plan as part of the 
16payment for such services under the medical benefit of the health plan;
17B.  Do not apply to the extent that they would require coverage of or enrollee cost-
18sharing for a generic drug or biosimilar under a health plan that is not permitted under 
19any applicable federal law or any law of this State; and
20C.  Do not require that a health plan include on its formulary a generic drug or 
21biosimilar if the carrier has not included the branded pharmaceutical for that generic 
22drug or biosimilar on its formulary due to a determination by the pharmacy and 
23therapeutics committee for that health plan that the branded pharmaceutical should 
24not be covered due to clinical concerns about the safety or efficacy of the branded 
25pharmaceutical based on the strength of scientific evidence.
265.  No cost-sharing or single copayment amount not precluded.  Nothing in this 
27section precludes a carrier from offering a health plan providing coverage of those 
28generic drugs and biosimilars for which coverage is required under subsection 2, 
29paragraph A or B and all branded pharmaceuticals on the formulary of the given health 
30plan without any enrollee cost-sharing or for a single copayment amount applicable to all 
31covered pharmaceuticals.
32SUMMARY
33This bill establishes requirements for the coverage of and cost-sharing for generic 
34drugs, biosimilars and branded pharmaceuticals when dispensed by pharmacies as 
35outpatient prescription drugs under health plans offered by carriers that provide coverage 
36for prescription drugs.
