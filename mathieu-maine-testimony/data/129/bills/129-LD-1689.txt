10SUMMARY
11This bill expands the scope and capabilities of hypodermic apparatus exchange 
12programs certified by the Department of Health and Human Services, Maine Center for 
13Disease Control and Prevention.  This bill requires the center to adopt rules that:
141. Allow the programs to distribute naloxone hydrochloride and other safer drug use 
15supplies; and
162.  Expand the criteria a program must meet in order to be awarded funds, including 
17distributing naloxone hydrochloride and other safer drug use supplies; providing HIV, 
18AIDS and hepatitis C testing; and maintaining referral agreements or having the capacity 
19to provide counseling services, medication-assisted treatment services and infectious 
20disease care.
21The center is also required to consider geographic distribution of services provided 
22by a program when allocating funding.
23This bill also amends the Maine Criminal Code to remove the crimes of furnishing 
24hypodermic apparatuses and illegal possession of hypodermic apparatuses and makes 
25changes to other statutes to reflect that decriminalization.
