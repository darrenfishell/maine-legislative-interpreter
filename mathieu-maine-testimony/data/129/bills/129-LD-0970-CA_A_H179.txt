20 municipalities are encouraged to develop policies in the comprehensive planning process 
21 that provide for accessory dwelling units, but it does not require municipalities to permit 
22 accessory dwelling units. It reorganizes the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 
23 4236, subsection 3-A, paragraph G for ease of understanding.
