business. This designation must be made in writing and signed by both the employee and 
employer.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment restores the ability of an employer to designate an employee as 
essential, as removed by the bill, but requires the disruption to the business by the 
employee's absence to be significant and requires the designation to be in writing and 
signed by both the employee and employer.
