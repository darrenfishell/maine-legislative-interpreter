33 This amendment replaces the bill. It amends the laws governing municipal zoning 
34 ordinance exemptions and the right of eminent domain in relation to use of land for a 
35 high-impact electric transmission line, which is redefined as a line greater than 50 miles 
36 in length and capable of operating at 200 kilovolts or more that is not a generator 
37 interconnection facility and is not constructed primarily for electric reliability within the

39 zoning ordinance when the Public Utilities Commission has determined it is reasonably 
40 necessary for public convenience and necessity for real estate to be used for a high-
41 impact electric transmission line is authorized only if the municipal officers by 
42 affirmative vote approve the commission's exemption. The amendment also requires a
