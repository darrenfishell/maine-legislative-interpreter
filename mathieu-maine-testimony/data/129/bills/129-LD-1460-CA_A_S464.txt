Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill establishes a drug take-back stewardship prog ram requirement for household pharmaceutical waste overseen 
by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  Manufacturers of household pharmaceuticals may choose to 
create individual programs, coordinate with other manuf acturers or utilize a third-party administrator when 
developing drug take-back programs to meet the stewar dship requirements. Costs related to the drug take-back 
stewardship programs must be paid by participating manufact urers. The bill authorizes the DEP to establish fees, paid 
by participants in the programs, to offset department co sts related to overseeing the program requirements. DEP has 
indicated that additional staffing woul d be required and the bill includes allo cations of $41,607 in fiscal year 2020-21 
to DEP for one Environmental Specialist III pos ition and associated costs. It is antic ipated that the DEP will be able to 
fund the increased allocation with the new fees.This bill may increase the number of civil suits filed in the court system. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time.  The collection of additional filing fees may increase Ge neral Fund and other dedicated revenue by minor amounts.Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
