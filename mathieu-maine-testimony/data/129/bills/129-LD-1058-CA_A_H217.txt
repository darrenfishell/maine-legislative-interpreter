Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Providing that a governmental entity that elects to make payments in lieu of contributions into the Unemployment 
Compensation Trust Fund is not liable to make payments for an individual who voluntarily separates from 
employment would create a conformity issue with the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). Being ruled out of 
conformity would jeopardize Maine employers' FUTA tax credits, increasing employer federal unemployment taxes 
by approximately $210 million annually, as well as $19 million in federal funds that Maine currently receives to 
administer the state's Employment Security laws.
