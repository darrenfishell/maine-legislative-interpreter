14 SUMMARY 
15 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. It removes the authority in 
16 current law for one winner-take-all-hand to be conducted during a game of chance 
17 tournament game and instead authorizes licensees to conduct one high-hand competition 
18 per tournament game. Under the amendment, a "high-hand competition" is defmed as an 
19 optional game of chance conducted during a tournament game in which the winner is the 
20 person who plays the highest hand of cards, according to the rules of the tournament, 
21 during the tournament game. Participation in the high-hand competition must be 
22 determined prior to the start of the tournament and the total number of bets received in a 
23 high-hand competition must be awarded to the winner or, in the case of multiple winners, 
24 divided among them as evenly as possible. 
25 The amendment also authorizes the payment of tournament game prizes and high-
26 hand competition prizes either in cash or by check.
