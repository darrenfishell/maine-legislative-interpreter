This amendment amends the committee amendment. This amendment retains the 
emergency preamble and emergency clause and, as in the committee amendment and the 
bill, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a reimbursement 
rate for a coordinated specialty care model to treat individuals showing early signs of 
psychotic disorder. Services must be evidence-based and treat both the individual and the 
family. Under this amendment, the Department of Health and Human Services is 
directed, in cooperation with the Department of Education and the Department of Labor, 
to establish a bundled rate to reimburse for services provided under the coordinated 
specialty care model that are not otherwise covered under the MaineCare program. This 
amendment moves the statutory requirements for the reimbursement to the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 22. This amendment retains the requirement that the Department 
of Health and Human Services apply to the United States Department of Health and 
Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for any necessary waivers 
and state plan amendments and to seek federal funding under the community mental 
health services block grant but changes cross-references. 
The amendment also changes the appropriations and allocations section.
