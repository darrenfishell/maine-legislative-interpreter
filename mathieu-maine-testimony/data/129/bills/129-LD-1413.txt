Page 1 - 129LR1695(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA ยง401, sub-ยง4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 643, ยง12 and 
3affected by ยง14, is further amended to read:
44.  Liability of landowner.  A landowner subject to this Act who contracts to have 
5wood harvested from the landowner's property by a contractor who, as an employer, is 
6subject to this Act and who has not complied with the provisions of this section and who 
7does not comply with the provisions of this section prior to the date of an injury or death 
8for which a claim is made is liable to pay to any person employed by the contractor in the 
9execution of the work any compensation under this Act that the landowner would have 
10been liable to pay if that person had been immediately employed by the landowner.
11If a landowner applies for and receives a predetermination under section 105 of the 
12independent status of a contractor that harvests forest products and requests and receives 
13a certificate of independent status certifying that the contractor harvests in a manner that 
14would not make the contractor an employee of the landowner, that certificate of 
15independent status remains valid unless the manner in which the contractor harvests 
16changes.  A landowner is not liable for compensation if at the time the landowner enters 
17into the contract with the contractor, the landowner applies for and receives a 
18predetermination of the independent status of the contractor as set forth in section 105, 
19the landowner requests and receives a certificate of independent status, issued by the 
20board on an annual basis to a contractor, certifying that the contractor harvests forest 
21products in a manner that would not make the contractor an employee of the landowner 
22or the landowner requests and receives a certificate of insurance, issued by the 
23contractor's insurance carrier, certifying that the contractor has obtained the required 
24coverage and indicating the effective dates of the policy, and if the landowner requests 
25and receives at least annually similar certificates indicating continuing coverage during 
26the performance of the work.  A landowner who receives a predetermination of the 
27contractor's status as independent contractor or a certificate of independent status is only 
28relieved of liability under this paragraph only if the contract for wood harvesting 
29expressly states that the independent contractor will not hire any employees to assist in 
30the wood harvesting without first providing the required certificate of insurance to the 
31landowner.
32Notwithstanding section 105, subsection 1, paragraph A, a predetermination under 
33section 105 related only to a person engaged in harvesting forest products is a conclusive 
34presumption that the determination is correct and section 105, subsection 2 does not apply 
35to that determination.  Each party involved in or affected by the predetermination must be 
36provided information on the workers' compensation laws and the effect of independent 
37contractor status in relation to those laws.  A predetermination under section 105 related 
38to a person engaged in harvesting forest products is effective for one calendar year or the 
39duration of the contract, whichever is shorter.
40A landowner required to pay compensation under this section is entitled to be 
41indemnified by the contractor and may recover the amount paid in an action against that 
42contractor.  A landowner may demand that the contractor enter into a written agreement 
43to reimburse the landowner for any loss incurred under this section due to a claim filed 
44for compensation and other benefits.  The employee is not entitled to recover at common 
Page 2 - 129LR1695(01)-11law against the landowner for any damages arising from such injury if the employee takes 
2compensation from that landowner.
3Landowners willfully acting to circumvent the provisions of this section by using 
4coercion, intimidation, deceit or other means to encourage persons who would otherwise 
5be considered employees within the meaning of this Act to pose as contractors for the 
6purpose of evading this section are liable subject to the provisions of section 324, 
7subsection 3.  Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit an employee from 
8becoming a contractor subject to the provisions of section 102, subsection 13-A.
9SUMMARY
10This bill provides that, when the Workers' Compensation Board issues a certificate of 
11independent status certifying that a contractor that harvests forest products does so in a 
12manner that would not make the contractor an employee of a landowner, that certificate 
13of independent status remains valid unless the manner in which the contractor harvests 
14changes.
