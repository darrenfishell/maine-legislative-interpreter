3CHAPTER 316-C
4VICTIMS' PROPERTY COMPENSATION FUND
5ยง3360-S.  Victims' Property Compensation Fund
61.  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
7following terms have the following meanings.
8A.  "Board" means the Victims' Compensation Board established in section 12004-J, 
9subsection 11.
10B.  "Crime" means a criminal offense committed under the laws of the State that 
11resulted in verifiable property loss of a person other than a person who committed the 
12crime.
13C.  "Fund" means the Victims' Property Compensation Fund established in subsection 
142.
15D.  "Property loss" means the value of property taken from a victim or of property 
16destroyed or otherwise broken or harmed as a direct result of a crime.  "Property loss" 
17includes a deductible paid by the victim pursuant to an insurance claim related to the 
18property loss.
192.  Victims' Property Compensation Fund established.  The Victims' Property 
20Compensation Fund is established to provide for the payment of claims arising under this 
21chapter and for the payment of all necessary and proper expenses incurred by the board in 
22carrying out this chapter.  The Attorney General shall administer the fund, which must be 
23held separate and apart from all other money, funds and accounts.  The fund receives 
24proceeds from money collected pursuant to subsection 3 and may receive private 
25donations, federal funds and state funds designated by law that may be used for the 
26payment of claims and for reasonable administrative costs.  Eligible investment earnings 
27credited to the assets of the fund become part of the assets of the fund.  Any unexpended 
28balances remaining in the fund at the end of any fiscal year do not lapse and must be 
29carried forward to the next fiscal year.
303.  Funding source.  In addition to an assessment under section 3360-I, the court 
31shall impose an assessment of $10 on any person convicted of murder or a Class A crime, 
32Class B crime or Class C crime and $5 on any person convicted of a Class D crime or 
33Class E crime.  Notwithstanding any other law, the court may not waive the imposition of 
34the assessment required by this subsection.  For purposes of collection and collection 
35procedures, this assessment is considered part of the fine.  At the time of commitment, the 
36court shall inform the Department of Corrections or the county sheriff of any unpaid 
37balances on assessments owed by the offender to the fund.  All funds collected as a result 
38of these assessments accrue to the fund.  When compensation is awarded from the fund, 
39the amount of any restitution ordered and paid as part of a sentence imposed that, when 
40added to the award from the fund, exceeds the victim's actual property loss must be paid 
Page 2 - 129LR1986(01)-11to the fund, in an amount not to exceed the amount of the award.  Similarly, the amount 
2of any insurance, 3rd-party payment or recovery in a successful civil action against a 
3person responsible for the property loss that, when added to the award from the fund, 
4exceeds the victim's actual property loss must be paid to the fund, in an amount not to 
5exceed the amount of the award.
64.  Eligibility.  The board may award compensation under this chapter to an 
7individual who:
8A.  Suffers a property loss as a result of a crime;
9B.  Would otherwise be eligible for compensation, even though:
10(1)  The criminal conduct occurred in this State but within the exclusive 
11jurisdiction of the United States;
12(2)  The property loss resulted from conduct that violates a criminal law of the 
13United States; or
14(3) The crime occurred in another state, but only if the person is a resident of this 
15State and the other state does not have a victims' property compensation program 
16for which residents of this State are eligible and the person would have been 
17eligible under this chapter if the conduct had occurred in this State; or
18C.  Is a resident of this State and suffers property loss as a direct result of a crime 
19specified in section 3360, subsection 3, paragraph F committed outside of the United 
20States.
215.  Claim requirements.  The board shall consider a claim under this chapter if:
22A.  The underlying crime was reported to a law enforcement officer within 5 days of 
23the occurrence or discovery of the crime or of the resultant property loss; and
24B.  The claim is filed with the board within 3 years of the occurrence of the property 
25loss or within 60 days of the discovery of the property loss, whichever is later.
26The board may waive the time requirements of this subsection for good cause shown.
276.  Cooperation.  Compensation under this chapter may not be paid:
28A.  To any claimant who does not fully cooperate with the board or with the 
29reasonable requests of law enforcement officers or prosecution authorities; or
30B.  To or on behalf of any person who violated a criminal law that caused or 
31contributed to the property loss for which compensation is sought.
327.  Submission of claims.  The board may provide forms for the submission of 
33claims and claims information under this chapter.  A claim must be submitted to the 
34board and must:
35A.  Be in writing;

37enforcement agency to which the crime was reported; and
Page 3 - 129LR1986(01)-11C.  Include documentation of an eligible property loss for which the claimant seeks 
2compensation, including the payment of any deductible paid by the victim pursuant to 
3an insurance claim related to the property loss.
48.  Compensation.  The board may award compensation under this chapter to a 
5claimant of up to $5,000 for actual and unreimbursed property losses or in whole or in 
6part for an insurance deductible paid by the victim pursuant to an insurance claim related 
7to the property loss.  The board, in its sole discretion, may disburse funds awarded 
8directly to the claimant or to the individuals or entities who provided the services to 
9restore, repair or replace property for which compensation was awarded.  In the case of 
10joint claimants, the board may apportion the total compensation as the board determines.
119.  Hearing; determination of compensation.  The board may hold a hearing on any 
12claim under this chapter, and the board shall hold a hearing if requested by the claimant.  
13The claimant may address the board at a hearing on the claim, and the board may take 
14testimony under oath.  A determination under this subsection must be conducted as 
15follows.
16A.  In addition to the material and information required by law and by the board, the 
17claimant may provide the board with any other information pertinent to the nature or 
18the amount of the claim.  The board shall receive and consider information provided 
19by law enforcement agencies and prosecution authorities and, at its sole discretion, 
20may receive and consider relevant information from any other source.
21B.  The board shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether a specified 
22crime occurred, whether the property loss was the result of that criminal conduct, the 
23amount of property loss suffered by the claimant, whether to award compensation and 
24the amount of the compensation, if awarded.  In determining the amount of 
25compensation to be paid, the board shall consider the amount available to pay 
26victims' property compensation claims, the history of claims paid by the board, the 
27number and amount of currently pending claims and the nature and cost of expenses 
28submitted by the claimant.
29C.  The board shall determine action on a claim with a quorum participating on that 
30claim, but any award of compensation requires the unanimous concurrence of all 
31members present.
32D.  The board's final decision must contain reasons for the determination.
3310.  Appeal.  Only a claimant under this chapter may appeal a decision of the board.  
34An appeal of the board's final decisions must be to the Superior Court as provided for 
35other administrative actions under chapter 375, subchapter 7.  Board decisions and the 
36amount of awards must be upheld unless the court finds no rational basis for the decision 
37or that the board abused its discretion.

25crimes in which the victims suffered property losses, patterned after the existing Victims' 
26Compensation Fund, which compensates victims of crimes for damages resulting from 
27personal injuries resulting from those crimes.  The Victims' Property Compensation Fund 
28is funded by an assessment of $10 on any person convicted of murder or a Class A crime, 
29Class B crime or Class C crime and $5 on any person convicted of a Class D crime or 
30Class E crime and may compensate a victim of a property crime up to $5,000 for property 
31losses or insurance deductibles paid pursuant to an insurance claim as a result of the 
32property loss.  The bill provides that the existing Victims' Compensation Board hears 
33claims made upon the Victims' Property Compensation Fund.
