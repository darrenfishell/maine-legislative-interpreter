3. Waiver. The commission, by rule or order, may waive the requirements of this 
section for an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility for the portion of the 
service territory of that utility that is located in an area of this State in which the retail 
market is administered by the independent system administrator for northern Maine if the

SUMMARY 
This amendment limits the applicability of the requirements of the bill to investor­
owned transmission and distribution utilities, rather than all transmission and distribution 
utilities, and to customer bills for residential, small commercial and medium commercial 
customers, rather than all customers. The amendment also allows the Public Utilities 
Commission to waive the requirements if it finds these requirements to be unduly 
burdensome or cost-prohibitive for an investor-owned transmission and distribution 
utility for the portion of the utility's service territory located in an area of this State in 
which the retail market is administered by the independent system administrator for 
northern Maine.
