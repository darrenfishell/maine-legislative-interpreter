recognition pursuant to subsection 1 is not granted by the public employer, the executive 
director of the board or a designee shall examine the demonstration of support. If the 
executive director of the board or a designee finds that a majority of the employees in a 
unit appropriate for bargaining have signed valid authorizations designating the 
employees' organization specified in the petition as their bargaining representative and 
that no other individual or labor organization is currently certified or recognized as the 
exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit, the board may not direct an 
election but shall certify the employees' organization as the representative. However, if 
the majority status of the employees in the appropriate unit is in question, the executive 
director of the board or a designee shall call an election to determine whether the 
organization represents a majority of the members in the bargaining unit.

2. Elections. The executive director of the board, or a designee, upon signed request

bargaining unit of publio employees pursuant to subsection 1-A, or upon signed petition 
of at least 30% of a bargaining unit of public employees that they desire to be represented

information that would identify a voter. · 
The ballot shall must contain the name of such organization and that of any other

employees within the unit, together with a choice for any public employee to designate 
that oo the public employee does not desire to be represented by any bargaining agent.

choices receives a majority vote of the public employees voting, a run-off election shall 
must be held. The l'U11-off ballot shall must contain the 2 choices whieh that received the 
largest and seoond largest 2nd-largest number of votes. When an organization receives 
the majority of votes of those voting, the executive director of the board shall certify it as 
the bargaining agent. The bargaining agent certified as representing a bargaining unit 
shall must be recognized by the public employer as the sole and exclusive bargaining 
agent for all of the employees in the bargaining unit unless and until a decertification 
election by secret ballot shall be !§ held and the bargaining agent declared by the 
executive director of the board as not representing a majority of the unit. 
Whenever 30% of the employees in a c:ertified bargaining unit petition for a bargaining 
agent to be dece1tified, the procedures for conducting an election on the question shall be 
are the same as for representation as bargaining agent hereinbefore set forth as 
established in this section.

certification or attempted certification.· Where there is a valid collective bargaining 
agreement in effect, ne .!! question concerning unit or representation may not be raised 
except during the period not more than• 90 nor less than 60 days prior to the expiration 
date of the agreement. The not more than 90-day nor less than 60-day period prior to the 
expiration date of an agreement regarding unit determination and representation shall 
does not apply to matters of unit clarification. 
The bargaining agent certified by the executive director of the board as the exclusive 
bargaining agent shall be required to represent all the public employees within the unit 
without regard to membership in the organization ce1tified as bargaining agent, prnvided 
except that any public employee at any time may present his that public employee's 
grievance to the public employer and have such grievance adjusted without the 
intervention of the bargaining agent, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms 
of a collective bargaining agreement . then in effect and if the bargaining agent's

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·'4< to H.P. 562, L.D. 757 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment strikes the bill, which is a concept draft, and replaces it with an 
3 amendment to the labor relations laws : governing municipal public employees. When 
4 employees in a collective bargaining unit file a request with their public employer to be 
5 represented by a certain organization as their collective bargaining agent, current law 
6 allows the public employer to request an election from the Maine Labor Relations Board 
7 in order to determine whether the organization indeed represents a majority of the 
8 members in the collective bargaining unit. Instead, this amendment would require an 
9 election only in such cases if, after examining the demonstration of majority support, the 
10 Maine Labor Relations Board fmds majority support for the organization to be in 
11 question.
