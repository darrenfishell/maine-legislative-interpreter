54.  Geologist.  "Geologist" means a person engaged in the practice of geology.
65.  Geology.  "Geology" means that the science which that treats of the earth as a

16biochemically weathered part of the earth's crust, the collection of natural bodies on the 
17earth's surface, supporting plants, with a lower limit at the deeper of either the 
18unconsolidated mineral or organic material lying within the zone of rooting of the native 
19perennial plants; or where horizons impervious to roots have developed the upper few

31Soil Survey, consultation or evaluation.
329.  Qualified soil scientist.  "Qualified soil scientist" shall mean means a person who, 
33by reason of his knowledge of pedology, the biological and physical sciences, acquired 
34by professional education and practical experience, is qualified to engage in the practice 
35of soil science as defined possesses the qualifications required for licensure as described

19enforcement officer, a state-licensed professional engineer or a state-certified state-
20licensed geologist determines that the integrity of a seawall, bulkhead, retaining wall or 
21similar structure in a coastal sand dune system is destroyed or threatened, the owner of 
22property protected by the seawall, bulkhead, retaining wall or similar structure may 
23perform or cause to be performed the following activities without obtaining a permit 
24under this article:
25A.  Place riprap, sandbags or other heavy nonhazardous material to shore up the 
26threatened structure and leave the material in place until a project designed to repair 
27or replace the structure is permitted by the department.  After such emergency action 
28is taken and within 5 working days after the imminent threat, the property owner 
29must provide written notice to the department of the date the emergency action was 
30taken and a description of the emergency action taken.  Within 6 months following 
31placement of any material pursuant to this paragraph, the property owner must submit 
32to the department an application to repair or replace the structure.  The material 
33placed pursuant to this paragraph must be removed within 18 months from the date a 
34permit is issued by the department; or
35B.  Make permanent repairs, to the extent necessary to alleviate the threat, to 
36strengthen the seawall, bulkhead, retaining wall or other structure, to widen the 
37footings or to secure the structure to the sand with tie-back anchors.  A state-certified 
38state-licensed geologist, state-licensed professional engineer or other qualified 
39professional must make the determination that the actions taken by the property 
40owner in accordance with this section are only those actions necessary to alleviate the 
41imminent threat and do not include increasing the height or length of the structure.
42If a local code enforcement officer, state-licensed professional engineer or state-certified 
43state-licensed geologist fails to determine within 6 hours of initial contact by the property 
44owner whether the integrity of a structure is destroyed or threatened, the property owner 
Page 10 - 129LR2362(01)-11may proceed as if the local code enforcement officer, state-licensed professional engineer 
2or state-certified state-licensed geologist had determined that the integrity of the structure

10SUMMARY
11This bill establishes a new pathway to licensure for persons who seek to become 
12licensed soil scientists.  The new pathway allows individuals with an associate degree in 
13soil science or another natural resources field to qualify with specific documented work
