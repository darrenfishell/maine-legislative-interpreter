42-A.  Tip pooling.  This section may not be construed to prohibit an employer from 
5establishing a valid tip pooling arrangement only among service employees that is 
6consistent with does not violate the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations 
7made pursuant to that Act.
8SUMMARY
9This bill clarifies that an employer may take an employee's tips as part of a valid tip 
10pooling arrangement if the arrangement is only among service employees.  It specifies 
11that such a tip pooling arrangement may not violate federal law rather than requiring that 
12it be consistent with federal law.  The intent of this bill is to clarify the distinction 
13between Maine law and any change to, or judicial interpretation of, the federal Fair Labor 
14Standards Act and associated regulations that would allow an employer to take a service 
15employee's tips for any reason other than for a valid tip pooling arrangement that is only 
16among service employees.
