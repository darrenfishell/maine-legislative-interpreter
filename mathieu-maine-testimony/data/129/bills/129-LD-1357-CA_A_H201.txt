10 Regarding State Licensure for the Sale ~f Spirits for Off-premises Consumption" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after section 3 the following: 
12 'Sec. 4. 28-A MRSA ยง453-A, sub-ยง5, as amended by PL 2005, c. 596, ยง1, is 
13 further amended to read: 
14 5. Licensing decisions. The bureau shall conduct an investigation to determine the 
15 feasibility of the location and type of facility for the agency liquor store and shall may 
16 issue the license to one or more of the applicants, taking into consideration the absence of 
17 an existing agency liquor store with less than 3,000 square feet of retail space in a 
18 downtown location and any other factors the bureau considers appropriate. The bureau is 
19 not required to consider the availability of parking spaces for motor vehicles for the 
20 issuance of an agency liquor store license to a store with less than 3,000 square feet of 
21 retail space in a downtown location. When considering the issuance of a license, the 
22 bureau shall consider the proximity of the proposed agency store to existing agency stores 
23 and the potential impact the location of the proposed agency store may have on an 
24 existing agency store. The bureau may deny a license if the bureau dete1mines the 
25 proposed agency store location is in too close proximity to an existing agency store. For 
26 purposes of this subsection, "downtown" has the same meaning as in Title 30-A, section 
27 4301, subsection 5-A.'

Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill changes the methodology for determining the number of agency liquor stores in a municipality from being 
determined by population to being determined by the municipality, places ownership limits on applications for 
agency liquor stores and allows the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) the option of 
not issuing a license if certain criteria are not met. The removal of a population-based limit on agency liquor stores 
in a municipality may generate additional General Fund revenue. However, because the number of new licenses 
issued is dependent upon the number of agency liquor stores authorized by a municipality, no estimate of additional 
revenue is made at this time.
