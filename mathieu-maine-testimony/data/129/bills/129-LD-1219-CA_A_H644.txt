Review Panel Not Authorized 
SUMMARY 5 MRSA §200-K 
This amendment replaces the bill and revises the title to reflect that the panel will 
review use of deadly force by law enforcement officers, not just officer-related deaths. 
The amendment establishes a panel of 15 members. The following are ex officio 
members, although each may appoint a designee to attend meetings and participate as a 
panel member: the Commissioner of Public Safety; the Director of Investigations for the 
Office of the Attorney General; the Director of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy; and 
the Chief Medical Examiner. The remaining members are appointed by the Attorney 
General: an attorney who represents plaintiffs in actions under 42 United States Code, 
Section 1983; a municipal police chief; a county sheriff; a mental health professional; a 
representative of a statewide collective bargaining law enforcement organization; a 
representative of a statewide civil rights organization; an attorney who represents 
defendants in actions under 42 United States Code, Section 1983; a criminal prosecutor; 
and 3 citizens, each of whom is not and has never been a sworn law enforcement officer. 
The panel is directed to select a chair and a vice-chair and must meet at least 
quarterly. The Attorney General must call the first meeting before January 1, 2020. 
The panel examines deaths and serious injuries that result from a law enforcement 
officer's use of deadly force. The panel will wait to conduct its examination until the 
Attorney General conducts the investigation of the use of deadly force by a law 
enforcement officer as required in current law. The purpose of the examinations is to 
identify whether there was compliance with accepted and best practices under the 
particular circumstances and whether the practices were sufficient for the particular 
circumstances or whether the practices require adjustment or improvement. The panel 
must recommend methods of improving standards, including changes to statutes, rules, 
training, policies and procedures designed to ensure incorporation of best practices that 
demonstrate increased public safety or officer safety.
