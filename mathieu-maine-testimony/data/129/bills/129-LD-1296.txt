33SUMMARY
34This bill does the following.
Page 7 - 129LR0926(01)-111. It defines "conversion therapy" as any aversive practice or treatment that seeks to 
2change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity except for talk therapy; 
3counseling or treatment intended to assist an individual undergoing a gender transition; 
4counseling intended to provide acceptance, support and understanding to the individual; 
5and counseling intended to facilitate the individual's coping, social support or identity 
6exploration and development, including any therapeutic intervention that is neutral with 
7regard to sexual orientation and that seeks to prevent or address unlawful conduct or 
8unsafe sexual practices, as long as the counseling does not seek to change the individual's 
9sexual orientation or gender identity.
102.  It defines "aversive practice or treatment" as any practice or treatment that is 
11intended to induce changes in behavior through unpleasant stimuli or punishment and 
12provides examples of aversive practices or treatments.
133.  It provides that advertising, offering or administering conversion therapy to 
14individuals under 18 years of age in the State is an unfair trade practice.  Court actions 
15involving conversion therapy brought against health care providers under the Maine 
16Unfair Trade Practices Act are not governed by the specialized procedures set forth in the 
17Maine Health Security Act for actions involving professional negligence.
184.  It prohibits school psychologists and guidance counselors, nurses, doctors, 
19physician assistants, psychologists, psychological examiners, alcohol and drug counselors 
20and aides, social workers, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, professional 
21counselors, marriage and family therapists, pastoral counselors, speech-language 
22pathologists and assistants and audiologists from administering conversion therapy to 
23individuals under 18 years of age.  Administration of conversion therapy to an individual 
24under 18 years of age in violation of this prohibition is grounds for discipline of the 
25professional by the department or board that issued the professional's license, certification 
26or registration, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of the license, 
27certification or registration.
285.  It prohibits MaineCare reimbursement for conversion therapy administered to an 
29individual who is under 18 years of age.
