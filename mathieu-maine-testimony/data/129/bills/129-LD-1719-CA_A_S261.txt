The bill moves the Maine Library 
of Geographic Infonnation (the Geolibrary) from the Department of Administrative 
and Financial Services (DAFS) to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF). DAFS has 
indicated it does not have any positions dedicated solely to the Geolibrary, and no positions are transferred from DAFS 
in the bill. The bill reduces funding to DAFS on an ongoing basis beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 by $200,000 for 
funding currently used on data acquisition for the Geolibrary that will no longer be needed. 
The bill establishes the Maine Library of Geographic Information Board (MLGIB) in the ACF to administer the 
Geolibrary. This bill adds a Geolibrarian and a GIS infonnation officer to staff the Maine Library of Geographic 
Information to collect, preserve and disseminate data, to manage funds and to direct the Geolibrary's activities. The bill 
includes General Fund appropriations of$177,215 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $255,647 in fiscal year 2020-?l to fund 
the new positions and associated costs. The bill also includes ongoing appropriations of $500,000 beginning in fiscal 
year 2019-20 for data acquisition and $1,500 for other expenses. The bill also establishes Other Special Revenue 
Funds and Federal Expenditures Fund base allocations of $500 to allow expenditure of any matching funding received.
