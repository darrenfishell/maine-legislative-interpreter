This amendment amends the committee amendment. This amendment retains the 
emergency preamble and emergency clause and, as in the committee amendment and the 
bill, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a reimbursement 
rate for a coordinated specialty care model to treat individuals showing early signs of 
psychotic disorder. Services must be evidence-based and treat both the individual and the 
family. Under this amendment, the Department of Health and Human Services is 
directed, in cooperation with the Department of Education and the Department of Labor 
and no later than July 1, 2020, to establish a bundled rate to reimburse for services 
provided under the coordinated specialty care model that are not otherwise covered under 
the MaineCare program. This amendment moves the statutory requirements for the 
reimbursement to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22. This amendment retains the 
requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services apply to the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services for any necessary waivers and state plan amendments and to seek federal 
funding under the community mental health services block grant but changes cross­
references and requires that necessary applications be submitted no later than 90 days 
after the effective date of this legislation. 
The amendment also changes the appropriations and allocations section.

MaineCare and changes the start date of the program to July 1, 2020 which reduces the ongoing General Fund 
appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by $1,210,798 in fiscal year 2019-20 and by
