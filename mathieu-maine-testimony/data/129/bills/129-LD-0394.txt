15SUMMARY
16The funds provided by this bond issue, in the amount of $50,000,000, will be used to 
17provide funds to the Finance Authority of Maine for zero-interest student loans and loan 
18consolidation or refinancing interest rate reductions for certain Maine residents who agree 
19to live and work in Maine for at least 5 years. The bill creates the Maine Student Loan 
20Debt Relief Program. Under the program, zero-interest loans up to $10,000 per year for a 
21maximum of 5 years are available to certain Maine residents who study at qualified in-
22state institutions of higher education and agree to live and work in Maine for at least 5 
23years following graduation. Loans bearing an annual interest rate of the prime rate of 
24interest plus 2% are available to those who do not live and work in the State upon 
25graduation.  The Finance Authority of Maine may provide interest rate reduction 
26payments to residents who use the authority's existing loan consolidation and refinancing 
27program. This option is available to individuals who studied in Maine or outside of Maine 
28and agree to live and work in Maine for at least 5 years. The bill exempts from Maine 
29income tax any benefits received under the program to the extent included in federal 
30adjusted gross income and prohibits individuals who have received benefits under the 
31program from receiving the Maine educational opportunity tax credit.
