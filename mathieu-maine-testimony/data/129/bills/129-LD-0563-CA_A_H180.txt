FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/t" to H.P. 407, L.D. 563, Bill, "An Act To Help 
Municipalities Prepare for Sea Level Rise" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 5 to 7 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 5. 30-A MRSA §4326, sub-§4-A is enacted to read: 
4-A. Addressing sea level rise. A municipality or multimunicipal region that is in 
the coastal area may include in its comprehensive plan projections regarding changes in 
sea level and potential effects of the• rise in sea level on buildings, transportation 
infrastructure, sewage treatment facilities and other relevant municipal, multimunicipal or 
privately held infrastructure or property and may develop a coordinated plan for 
addressing the effects of the rise in sea level. For the purposes of this subsection, "coastal 
area" has the same meaning as in Title 38, section 1802, subsection 1.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that a municipality or multimunicipal region that is in the 
"coastal area" as that term is defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 
1802, subsection 1 is subject to the bill. The amendment also strikes from the bill a 
requirement that state, local and certain federal agencies responsible for regulating, 
planning, developing or managing coastal resources conduct their activities affecting the 
coastal area consistent with the policy of encouraging the assessment of and planning for 
the effects of the rise in sea level.
