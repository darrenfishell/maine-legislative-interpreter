FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 746, L.D. 1004, Bill, "An Act To 
Reduce Costs and Emissions by Increasing Telecommuting at State Agencies" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Direct the Department of Administrative and Financial Services To 
Study the Costs and Benefits of Telework to the State and Its Employees' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
'Preamble. Whereas, the Legislature finds that permitting state employees to 
telework is likely to reduce carbon emissions in the State by eliminating or substantially 
reducing the physical commutes to and from state employees' usual work sites; and 
Whereas, the Legislature finds that permitting state employees to telework will have 
benefits and costs for the State and its employees; and 
Whereas, the Legislature desires more information on the costs and benefits to the 
State and its employees; now, therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Department of Administrative and Financial Services directed to 
study telework for state employees. Resolved: That the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, referred to in this resolve as "the department," 
shall study the costs and benefits of telework to the State and its employees. For 
purposes of this resolve, "telework" means a flexible work arrangement under which an 
employee performs the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position from a 
location other than an office or location provided by the employer. 
Sec. 2. Scope of study. Resolved: That the department in conducting the study 
under section 1 shall: 
1. Review all executive branch positions, by agency, and identify those positions for 
which presence in a specific location on a regular basis is not an essential component 
of the position;

4 total weekly mileage of those employees; 
5 4. Survey all employees in positions identified under subsection 1 to determine the 
6 total number of employees interested in telework and the number of those employees 
7 by position and agency; 
8 5. Evaluate the potential effects of telework on the executive branch and its 
9 employees on matters such as: 
1 o a. Employee productivity; 
11 b. Office or workspace required that is provided by the executive branch; 
12 c. Use of state fleet vehicles; 
13 d. Employee health and morale; 
14 e. Employee retention; 
15 f. Size of the applicant pool; 
16 g. Supervisory interactions and effectiveness; 
17 h. Communications among supervisory and other employees; 
18 i. Security and confidentiality concerns; 
19 j. Workers' compensation liability; and 
20 k. Access to services by the public; 
21 6. Assess lessons learned from the experience of other states or large employers with 
22 telework; 
23 7. Identify and evaluate key obstacles to the implementation of telework; 
24 8. Estimate savings achieved or costs incurred and the overall net impact of 
25 telework; and 
26 9. Evaluate the potential and develop a time line for a telework pilot program. 
27 Sec. 3. Reporting date. Resolved: That the department shall report its findings 
28 from the study under section 1, including recommendations and recommended 
29 legislation, to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
30 state and local government matters by October 1, 2020. The joint standing committee is 
31 authorized to submit a bill to the First Regular Session of the 130th Legislature related to 
32 the subject matter of the report.'
