Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill increases the sales tax rate on short-term rentals of automobiles, small trucks and vans from 10% to 12% and 
increases General Fund revenue by $890,226 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,062,594 in fiscal year 2020-21. It also 
increases Local Government Fund revenue by $44,640 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $102,780 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
The transfer of this tax from the General Fund to the Multimodal Transportation Fund does not occur until the fiscal 
year after the tax is collected. Therefore, Multimodal Transportation Fund revenues would not be increased until 
fiscal year 2020-21 in the amount of $890,226. The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation to the 
Department of Transportation of $890,226 in fiscal year 2020-21 to allow expenditure of the increased revenue.
