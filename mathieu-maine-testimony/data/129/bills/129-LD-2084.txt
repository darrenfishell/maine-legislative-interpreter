19(1)  One square foot of usable floor space per egg-laying hen in multitiered

29A.  While the egg-laying hen is the subject of medical research;
30B.  During the examination, testing, individual treatment of or operation on the egg-

39period.
Page 3 - 129LR2897(01)-114.  Defense.  In an action to enforce subsection 2, paragraph B, it is a defense that a 
2business owner or operator relied in good faith upon a written certification by the supplier 
3of shell eggs that the shell eggs at issue were not derived from any egg-laying hen who 
4was confined in violation of subsection 2, paragraph A.
55.  Violation; penalty.  Notwithstanding section 4016, violation of this section is 
6governed by this subsection.  A person who violates this section commits a civil 
7violation.  The court shall adjudge a civil fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000 
8per violation.
96.  Injunction.  In lieu of or in addition to the collection of fines under subsection 5, 
10the commissioner may bring a civil action in the Superior Court to prevent, restrain or 
11enjoin a violation of this section.  If in that action a violation or threatened violation of 
12this section is established, the court may enjoin and restrain or otherwise prohibit the 
13violation or threatened violation.
147.  Relation to other laws.  The provisions of this section are in addition to, and not 
15in lieu of, any other laws protecting animal welfare. This section may not be construed to 
16limit any state law or rules protecting the welfare of animals or to prevent a local 
17governing body from adopting and enforcing its own animal welfare ordinances and 
18regulations.
19The affirmative defense provisions in section 4016, subsection 3 do not apply to this 
20section.  It is not an affirmative defense to alleged violations of this section that the egg-
21laying hen is kept as part of an agricultural operation and in compliance with best 
22management practices for animal husbandry.
23Sec. 2.  Legislative findings.  The Legislature finds that the regulation of egg 
24production and of the sale of eggs is necessary to protect the health and welfare of 
25consumers in the State, to promote food safety, to advance animal welfare and to protect 
26the State against the negative fiscal impacts associated with the absence of effective 
27regulation of egg production and sales of eggs.
28SUMMARY
29This bill provides that, after December 31, 2024:
301.  Farm owners and operators in the State must keep their egg-laying hens in cage-
31free housing systems; and
322.  Business owners and operators may not sell in the State eggs from hens that are 
33not kept in cage-free housing systems.
34Under the bill, a person who violates these requirements commits a civil violation for 
35which a fine may be adjudged.  In addition, the bill authorizes the Commissioner of 
36Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to bring a civil action to prevent, restrain or 
37enjoin a violation of the requirements.
