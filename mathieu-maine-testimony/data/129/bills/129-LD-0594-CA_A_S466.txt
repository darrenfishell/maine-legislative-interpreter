12 B. Beginning January 1, 2023, the board shall require a covered employer with 15 to 
13 24 covered employees to offer the program to its covered employees.
14 C. Beginning June 1, 2023, the board shall require a covered employer with 5 to 14 
15 covered employees to offer the program to its covered employees.
16 Notwithstanding paragraphs A to C, a covered employer may voluntarily offer the program 
17 to its covered employees on or after March 1, 2022. A covered employer with fewer than 
18 5 employees is not required to offer the program to its covered employees but may offer 
19 the program to its employees at the option of the employer. 
204.  Penalties.  The board shall establish and enforce penalties in accordance with this 
21 subsection. 
22 A. As set forth in this paragraph, if a covered employer fails to enroll a covered 
23 employee without reasonable cause, the covered employer is subject to a penalty for 
24 each covered employee for each calendar year or portion of a calendar year during 
25 which the covered employee was not enrolled in the program or had not opted out of 
26 participation in the program and, for each calendar year beginning after the date on 
27 which a penalty has been assessed with respect to a covered employee, is subject to a 
28 penalty for any portion of that calendar year during which the covered employee 
29 continues to be unenrolled without opting out of participation in the program. The 
30 amount of any penalty imposed on a covered employer for the failure to enroll a 
31 covered employee without reasonable cause is determined as follows: 
32 (1) Prior to July 1, 2023, the maximum penalty per covered employee is $10; 
33 (2) From July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, the maximum penalty per covered 
34 employee is $20; 
35 (3) From July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2025, the maximum penalty per covered 
36 employee is $50; and 
37 (4) On or after January 1, 2026, the maximum penalty per covered employee is 
38 $100.
39 B. A penalty may not be imposed on a covered employer for any failure to enroll a 
40 covered employee for which it is established that the covered employer did not know 
41 that the failure existed and exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of 
42 this chapter.
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 181, L.D. 594
Page 11 - 129LR0153(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1 C.  A penalty may not be imposed on a covered employer for any failure to enroll a 
2 covered employee if the covered employer exercised reasonable diligence to meet the 
3 requirements of this chapter and the covered employer complies with those 
4 requirements with respect to each covered employee by the end of the 90-day period 
5 beginning on the first date the covered employer knew, or exercising reasonable 
6 diligence would have known, that the failure existed. 
7 D. In the case of a failure that is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all 
8 or part of the penalty may be waived to the extent that the payment of the penalty would 
9 be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.
10 E. If a covered employer fails to transmit a payroll deduction contribution to the 
11 program on the earliest date the amount withheld from the covered employee's 
12 compensation can reasonably be segregated from the covered employer's assets, but 
13 not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the covered 
14 employee's contribution amounts are withheld from the covered employee's paycheck, 
15 the failure to remit the contribution on a timely basis is subject to the same penalties as 
16 apply to employer misappropriation of employee wage withholdings and to the 
17 penalties specified in paragraph A.
18 F. The Attorney General shall represent the board in enforcement and collection of 
19 penalties.

21 in writing that the information may be disclosed.
222. Restriction on use of personal information. An individual or organization that has 
23 access to personal information of participants solely because of its contracts or agreements 
24 with the board to provide services or support to the program, including plan administration, 
25 may not use that information to market its products or services not associated with the 
26 program to participants unless the participant affirmatively consents to receive such 
27 information.
28§177.  Intergovernmental collaboration and cooperation
29 The board may enter into an intergovernmental agreement or memorandum of 
30 understanding with the State and any agency or instrumentality of the State to receive

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to S.P. 181, L.D. 594
Page 15 - 129LR0153(02)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT45 otherwise transferred to the enterprise fund from or deposited in the enterprise fund by the 
46 State or a unit of federal, state or local government or any other person, firm, partnership 
47 or corporation, including appropriations to the enterprise fund by the Legislature and funds 
48 from the payment of application, account, administrative or other fees and the payment of 
49 other funds due the board.  Interest or other investment earnings or returns that are 
50 attributable to funds in the enterprise fund must be deposited into or retained in the 
51 enterprise fund.  The enterprise fund may not lapse but must be carried forward to carry 
52 out the purposes of this chapter. The board shall amortize any amounts appropriated to the 
53 enterprise fund by the Legislature to ensure that those amounts are paid back to the funding 
54 sources based on an amortization schedule determined by the board, but no later than 5 
55 years after the program is fully implemented. 
122. Borrowing. To enable or facilitate the start-up and continuing operation, 
13 maintenance, administration and management of the program until the program 
14 accumulates sufficient balances and can generate sufficient funding through fees assessed 
15 on program accounts for the program to become financially self-sustaining, the board may 
16 borrow from the State, any unit of federal, state or local government or any other person, 
17 firm, partnership or corporation working capital funds and other funds as may be necessary 
18 for this purpose, as long as such funds are borrowed in the name of the program and board 
19 only and that any such borrowing is repaid solely from the revenues of the program. The 
20 board may not borrow from the retirement system for any purpose. The board may enter 
21 into long-term procurement contracts with one or more financial or service providers that 
22 provide a fee structure that would assist the program in avoiding or minimizing the need to 
23 borrow or to rely upon general assets of the State.
243. Administrative costs. Subject to appropriation by the Legislature, the State may pay 
25 administrative costs associated with the creation, maintenance, operation and management 
26 of the program and provide funding for the program until sufficient assets are available in 
27 the enterprise fund for that purpose. Thereafter, all administrative costs of the enterprise 
28 fund, including any repayment of start-up funds provided by the State, must be repaid only 
29 out of money on deposit in the enterprise fund. However, private funds or federal funding 
30 received in order to implement the program until the enterprise fund is self-sustaining may 
31 not be repaid unless those funds were offered contingent upon the promise of such 
32 repayment.
334. Use of enterprise fund. The board shall use the money in the enterprise fund solely 
34 to pay the administrative costs and expenses of the program and the administrative costs 
35 and expenses the board incurs in the performance of its duties under this chapter. 
36§179.  Accounting and annual report
371. Account; audit. The board shall cause an accurate account of all of the program's, 
38 enterprise fund's and board's activities, operations, receipts and expenditures to be 
39 maintained on a calendar year basis. A full audit of the books and accounts of the board 
40 pertaining to those activities, operations, receipts and expenditures must be conducted by 
41 a certified public accountant, including, but not limited to, direct and indirect costs 
42 attributable to the use of outside consultants, independent contractors and any other persons 
43 who are not state employees for the administration of the program.  For the purposes of the 
44 audit, the auditors must have access to the properties and records of the program and board 
45 and may prescribe methods of accounting and the rendering of periodic reports in relation 
46 to projects undertaken by the program.1

13Sec. 3.  Implementation of Maine Retirement Savings Program.  Except as 
14 provided in this section, the Maine Retirement Savings Board shall establish the Maine 
15 Retirement Savings Program as required under this Act so that individuals may begin 
16 making contributions under the program no later than July 1, 2022. The board shall phase 
17 in the program with regard to covered employers and accept contributions from covered 
18 employees employed by those covered employers as required under this Act and may in its 
19 discretion phase in the program for individuals who are not employees, such as self-
20 employed individuals or independent contractors, expect that any implementation schedule 
21 set by the board must be such that all individuals may begin making contributions under 
22 the program no later than January 1, 2024. The board may not implement the program if 
23 and to the extent that the board determines that the program is preempted by the federal 
24 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29 United States Code, 
25 Section 1001 et seq.  If and to the extent that the board determines that a portion or aspect 
26 of the program is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
27 1974, the board may not implement that portion or aspect of the program but shall proceed 
28 to implement the remainder of the program to the extent practicable. If the board determines 
29 that some but not all of the payroll deduction individual retirement account arrangements 
30 or other arrangements under the program are or would be employee benefit plans under the 
31 federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the board shall implement the 
32 program with respect to the other arrangements under the program to the extent practicable 
33 and may not implement the program with respect to plans covered by the federal Employee 
34 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or proceed to implement the program with respect 
35 to plans covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on a 
36 basis reflecting their status or possible status as such, as long as such actions do not create 
37 an undue risk of causing the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to 
38 preempt state law with respect to other portions of the program or causing other 
39 arrangements under the program to be treated as plans covered by the federal Employee 
40 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
41Sec. 4.  Staggered terms.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
42 section 172, subsection 3, with regard to the original appointments of the members of the

Fiscal Note
The bill establishes the Maine Retirement Savings Program En terprise Fund (the Fund) and transfers money held by 
the Treasurer of State on behalf of the Attorney General that was received pursuant to the court order in State of 
Maine v. Equifax, Inc., Kennebec County Superior Cour t Docket No. CV-19-152 and the Wells Fargo & Company 
multistate settlement agreement to the Fund. The bill also includes an allocation to the Fund of $1,600,000 in fiscal 
year 2020-21. This allocation is funded by the transfer descri bed above and is to be used for administrative expenses 
incurred in the performance of the retirement system’s dutie s under this chapter. Because this legislation provides 
that the Fund reimburse the Maine Public Employees Retirem ent System (MainePERS) for the full cost of any staff 
time provided to the Maine Retirement Savings Board, incl uding the time of the executive director, there is no net 
fiscal impact to MainePERS.The general operating expenses of this study are projected  to be $420 in fiscal year 2020-21, $2,560 in fiscal year 
2021-22 and $2,340 in fiscal year 2022-23. An estimated $6,190 is available in fiscal year 2020-21 in the 
Legislature's budget for legislative studies as well as ba lances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these 
amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council 
and the Legislature. The additional costs of providing st affing assistance to the study during the interim can be
