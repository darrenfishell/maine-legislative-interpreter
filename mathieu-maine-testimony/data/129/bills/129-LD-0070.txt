Page 1 - 129LR0091(01)-11 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง5219-TT is enacted to read:
3 ยง5219-TT.  Apprenticeship credit
4 1. Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the
5 following terms have the following meanings.
6 A.  "Apprenticeship program" means an apprenticeship program approved by the 
7 Department of Labor pursuant to Title 26, chapter 37.
8 B.  "Employing unit" has the same meaning as in Title 26, section 1043, subsection 
9 10.
10 C.  "Participating apprentice" means a registered apprentice, pursuant to Title 26, 
11 section 3202, participating in an apprenticeship program.
12 2. Credit allowed.  For tax years beginning in 2020 or after, a taxpayer constituting
13 an employing unit that employs a participating apprentice in the taxable year is allowed a 
14 credit against taxes imposed under this Part for each participating apprentice employed by 
15 the taxpayer during the taxable year.
16 3. Amount of credit.  For an employing unit employing a participating apprentice
17 for at least 2,000 hours during the taxable year, the credit under this section is $2,500.  
18 For an employing unit employing a participating apprentice for fewer than 2,000 hours 
19 during the taxable year, the credit is $2,500 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of 
20 which is the number of hours that the participating apprentice worked for the employing 
21 unit during the taxable year and the denominator of which is 2,000.
22 4. Participation statement and apprenticeship program certificates.  An
23 employing unit claiming a credit under this section for one or more participating 
24 apprentices shall submit with the employing unit's Maine income tax return for the 
25 taxable year a statement indicating the number of hours worked by each participating 
26 apprentice during the taxable year for which a credit is claimed under this section.  The 
27 statement must include employing unit and participating apprentice information and any 
28 other information the assessor considers necessary to determine eligibility for the credit 
29 under this section.  A pass-through entity, such as a partnership, limited liability 
30 company, S corporation or similar pass-through entity, shall submit the statement 
31 required by this subsection directly to the bureau.  The Department of Labor shall provide 
32 the bureau with copies of apprenticeship program certificates of eligibility and any 
33 pertinent information that will assist the assessor in determining eligibility for the credit 
34 under this section.
35 SUMMARY
36 This bill permits an employer who employs an apprentice participating in an 
37 approved apprenticeship program to receive a tax credit and provides for a partial credit if 
38 the employer employs a participating apprentice for fewer than 2,000 hours during a 
39 calendar year.
