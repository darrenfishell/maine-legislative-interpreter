This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $1,000,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 to a newly created 
Maine Healthcare Provider Loan Repayment (MHPLR) Program Fund within the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) 
for the repayment of student loans for certain nurse educators and to pay the costs to FAME for administering the 
fund, Additional funding will come from 25% of future proceeds that would have gone to the Maine Budget 
Stabilization Fund from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund (LORF) that will now be deposited into the loan 
repayment program. 
Current law requires that after all liquor operation revenue bonds and ancillary obligations are paid off in fiscal year 
2023-24 using the proceeds of the liquor contract, 15% of the revenue is to be divided equally between the DHHS and 
the Departm,ent of Environmental Protection (DEP) for revolving loan funds for drinking water systems and 
wastewater treatment, 35% will go to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for construction of highways and 
bridges and 50% will go to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The new distribution of the LORF revenue after fiscal year 2023-24 would be as follows: 15% will still be divided 
equally between the DHHS and the DEP, 35% will still go to the DOT, 25% will go to the MHPLR Fund to be used to 
finance the loan repayment program and 25% instead of 50% will go to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. These 
changes would all occur after June of 2024. 
Any additional costs to the State Economist and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to participate 
in the advisory committee are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
