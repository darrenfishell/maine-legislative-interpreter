7SUMMARY
8This bill amends the laws governing alcoholic beverages to change references to 
9"distilled spirits" to "spirits" and "alcoholic beverages" to "liquor" to be consistent with 
10defined terms.  The bill also changes references to "list price" to "retail price" to reflect 
11the fact that the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
12Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations is authorized to discount list prices set by 
13the State Liquor and Lottery Commission, changes references to "list price" to "wholesale 
14price" in the provisions regarding the sale price of spirits sold by a reselling agent to an 
15establishment licensed for on-premises consumption and clarifies the use of "retail price" 
16and "discount retail price."  The bill removes outdated language regarding the control of 
17the spirits business by the bureau and the sale of fortified wines, corrects a reference to 
18"agent" to read "sales representative" and corrects a reference regarding the issuance of 
19licenses to manufacturers, bottlers and rectifiers to clarify that the bureau and not the 
20commission issues those licenses.
21The bill clarifies that the bureau does not consider a violation of the laws governing 
22liquor to have occurred unless the violation has been adjudicated by the District Court 
23and requires that the bureau consider a violation of the bureau's rules as a disqualification 
24for receiving a license.
25The bill authorizes the bureau to offer instant redeemable coupons to consumers in 
26addition to suppliers and manufacturers of spirits through the bureau's publicly accessible

31retail location is an agency liquor store.

33of taxes on those samples.  It enacts new language regarding access by sales

35representative.  The product must be taken from the supplier's bailment inventory housed 
36at the warehouse managed by the State's wholesale liquor provider.  The bill also 
37authorizes spirits manufacturers and suppliers to donate spirits to on-premises events in a 
38similar manner as certificate of approval holders and wholesalers.
