11 Under current law, data that communication service providers and certain wireless 
providers are required to provide to the ConnectME Authority may be designated as 
confidential information by an order of the authority and not subject to the Freedom of 
Access Act. This amendment instead designates all data provided to the authority as 
confidential and, like the committee amendment, allows the authority to remove that 
confidential designation following a proceeding to determine whether to remove the 
confidential designation of specific information.
