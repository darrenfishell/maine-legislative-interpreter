Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Reducing the maximum amount an employer can withhold from an employee's pay in order to recover 
overcompensation, including overcompensation of paid leave, from 10% to 5% will delay the State's ability to fully 
recoup payments to an employee made in enor. Prohibiting an employer from recovering overcompensation paid to aL 
employee in enor to three years preceding the date of discove1y of the overcompensation may limit or eliminate the 
State's ability to recover the amount of the error.
