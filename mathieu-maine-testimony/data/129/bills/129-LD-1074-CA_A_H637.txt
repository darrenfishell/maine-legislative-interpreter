by the voters at a statewide election and changes dates to reflect the referendum timing.

Referendum Costs Month/Year Election Type Question Length 
Nov-19 General Referendum Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a 
second ballot, an additional appropriation of $172,000 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill creates an excise tax of 5¢ per gallon on the-extraction of groundwater or surface water for commercial 
bottling for resale for each bottled water operator that extracted more than 1.5 million gallons of groundwater or 
surface water in the previous calendar year, contingent on voter approval at a statewide election. Revenue from the 
tax will be credited to the Highway Fund. If approved by the voters, Highway Fund revenue is expected to increase 
by approximately $53 million per year. The Department of Administrative and Financial Services will need a 
General Fund appropriation of $100,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 for computer programming to create the new tax in 
the processing system.
