number of individuals engaging in training to become behavioral health professionals 
providing children's home and community-based treatment services within existing 
resources. The department may make any changes necessary, including choosing to 
charge individuals or their employers fees for training, in order to offer training within 
existing resources.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the concept draft. It changes the educational requirements 
for behavioral health professionals providing children's home and community-based 
treatment to replace the requirement for a bachelor's degree to a minimum of 60 credit 
hours in a related field, 90 credit hours in an unrelated field combined with a plan for 
supervision and training or a high school diploma or equivalent with 3 years of 
experience working in the field combined with a plan for supervision and training. The 
educational requirements do not change the required behavioral health professional 
training or the prescribed time frames for that training. It also requires the Department of 
Health and Human Services to amend or establish contracts for training behavioral health 
professionals to train any additional individuals within existing resources, and authorizes 
the department to opt to charge individuals or their employers fees for training.

Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Changing the educational requirements to qualify to be a behavioral health professional (BHP) providing children's 
home and community-based treatment will lead to an increase in the number of BHPs and an increase in the amount of 
professional training required by BHPs. Currently, the training for BHPs is provided through a 3rd-party contract 
funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This bill allows the DHHS to amend or establish 
contracts to stay within existing resources while training a greater number of individuals. The DHHS may make any 
changes necessary, including choosing to charge fees from individuals or their employers, in order to offer the training 
within existing resources. As this bill provides no new funding, the impact of these new costs on other programs in the 
DHHS cannot be determined at this time.
