28 SUMMARY 
29 This amendment changes the effective date of the Maine Uniform Probate Code, the 
30 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, enacted by Public Law 2017, chapter 402, from July 
31 1, 2019 to September 1, 2019. 
32 This amendment also clarifies an ambiguity as to the applicable effective date of the 
33 elective share provisions of Article 2, Part 2 of Title 18-C and of the exempt property and 
34 allowances provisions under Article 2, Part 4 of Title 18-C. As written, the language of 
35 the Maine Uniform Probate Code, as adopted in section 8-301, subsection 2, leaves 
36 ambiguity as to whether, after the effective date of Title 18-C, the existing Title 18-A 
37 provisions regarding elective share rights of a surviving spouse and the existing Title 
38 18-A provisions governing exempt property and allowances govern the administration of

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT'~ "to H.P. 1118, L.D. 1535 
1 an estate of a decedent who died prior to the effective date of Title 18-C. To resolve the 
2 ambiguity and provide clarity on the applicability of the new provisions of Title 18-C, the 
3 Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission recommended that a new paragraph A-1 be 
4 added to section 8-301, subsection 2. 
5 This amendment amends the adult guardianship, conservatorship and other protective 
6 arrangements provisions to clarify that the court retains its discretion when determining 
7 whether guardianship, conservatorship, protective arrangements or other less restrictive 
8 alternatives, including supported decision making, are appropriate in each case before the 
9 court. 
10 The court may consider any proposed vetting of the person or persons chosen to 
11 provide support in decision making; reports to the court by an interested party or parties 
12 regarding the effectiveness of an existing supported decision-making arrangement; or any 
13 other information the court determines necessary or appropriate to determine whether 
14 supportive services, technological assistance, supported decision making, protective 
15 arrangements or less restrictive arrangements will provide adequate protection for the 
16 respondent when a petition has been filed for guardianship, conservatorship or other 
17 protective arrangements. 
18 This amendment updates Title 18-C with amendments that were included in the 
19 Maine Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, enacted by Public Law 
20 2017, chapter 359 as amendments to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-A, in the 
21 definition of "property" to include digital assets and to authorize an agent under a power 
22 of attorney to exercise authority over the content of an electronic communication of the 
23 principal if specifically authorized to do so in a power of attorney. 
24 This amendment permits the appointment, by renunciation or nomination, of a person 
25 who does not have priority for appointment as personal representative, in an informal 
26 probate proceeding, rather than requiring a formal probate proceeding for the 
27 appointment. As written, Title 18-C, section 3-203, subsection 5 changes current Maine 
28 law by permitting the appointment of a person who does not have priority, including 
29 priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined pursuant to section 3-203, 
30 only in formal proceedings. Current Maine law permits an appointment resulting from 
31 renunciation or nomination in informal proceedings. Requiring a formal proceeding for 
32 such an appointment would be an unnecessary burden on the Probate Courts and on the 
33 parties seeking appointment of a personal representative. 
34 This amendment clarifies that a person may refuse to recognize the authority of a 
35 guardian or conservator to act on behalf of an individual subject to guardianship or 
36 conservatorship if the guardian's or conservator's proposed action would be inconsistent 
37 with not only the Maine Uniform Probate Code but any other law, rule or regulation. It 
3 8 also provides that a person who refuses to accept the authority of the guardian or 
39 conservator in any situation is required to report the refusal and the reason for the refusal 
40 to the court. This gives the court the opportunity to review the guardian or conservator 
41 and determine if removal or other action is appropriate. 
42 This amendment replaces the provisions governing the appointment of a guardian for 
43 a minor on an emergency basis and is based on recommendations from the Family Law 
44 Advisory Commission. The amendment to the Title 18-C, section 5-204 permits the 
45 appointment of a guardian for a minor on an emergency basis for up to 90 days upon

1 evidence that the appointment is needed to prevent substantial harm to the minor's 
2 physical health or safety. The new language provides guidance to the courts, attorneys 
3 and litigants by: 
4 1. Clarifying that it is the petitioner's responsibility to provide actual notice of the 
5 petition for appointment of a guardian on an emergency basis and of any appointment 
6 made on an ex parte basis to the parent, the minor and any person having custody of the 
7 minor; 
8 2. Setting forth the requirements for providing such notice and the procedure for 
9 informing the court of the notice provided; and 
10 3. Clarifying that the standards and procedures that apply to appointing a guardian on 
11 an emergency basis do not alleviate or alter the notice requirements and standards for 
12 appointing a guardian on a non-emergency basis under Title 18-C, section 5-204, 
13 subsection 2. 
14 This amendment requires that the visitor appointed by the court in an adult 
15 guardianship or conservatorship case is required to interview the petitioner and the 
16 proposed guardian or proposed conservator, as applicable. 
17 This amendment provides that a professional evaluation is not required before the 
18 appointment of an emergency guardian or emergency conservator if the court finds from 
19 affidavit or testimony that the basis for an emergency has been met and the petitioner has 
20 good cause for not submitting a professional evaluation before the emergency order. The 
21 amendment also corrects a cross-reference. 
22 This amendment provides that when the court has appointed a public guardian, no 
23 coguardian may be appointed, and no coconservator may be appointed when a public 
24 conservator has been appointed. 
25 This amendment cross-references the requirements that apply to private guardians 
26 and conservators to ensure that the same requirements apply to public guardians and 
27 conservators. 
28 This amendment resolves an inconsistency in the adoptions laws between Title 18-C, 
29 section 9-202, subsection 4, which allows a parent to have 5 days to revoke a written 
30 consent to an adoption or a surrender and release of their parental rights, and subsection 
31 6, which states that a consent or surrender and release are final and irrevocable upon 
32 execution. This inconsistency has not created a problem in practice because of how the 
33 law has been applied by courts, which is to approve consents or surrender and releases 
34 only after the completion of the revocation period under subsection 4. This amendment 
35 eliminates this inconsistency by eliminating "when duly executed" and in its place 
36 providing that a surrender and release or a consent is final and irrevocable upon the 
37 court's approval pursuant to the other requirements of that section, as set forth in 
38 subsection 2.
