11public funds appropriated, allocated or dedicated to the fund must be deposited into the 
12fund as well as income from any other source directed to the fund. All interest earned by 
13the fund becomes part of the fund.  Legislation that proposes to enact or amend a law that 
14would change the distribution of the revenue directed to the fund by this subsection or by 
15Title 36, section 5111, subsection 7 must be submitted to the Legislative Council and to 
16the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over education matters

21subsection. 
22A.  If the General Fund appropriation for the state contribution for general purpose 
23aid for local schools as finally enacted in any year is insufficient to meet the annual 
24target established by section 15752, the commissioner shall use the fund to 
25supplement the state contribution.  These supplemental funds must be used to enable 
26the State to meet the annual target established by section 15752 or to decrease the 
27amount by which state funding from all other sources falls short of the target.  The 
28commissioner shall announce the increased state contribution amounts made possible 
29by the supplemental amounts obtained from the fund within 14 days after final 
30enactment of the General Fund appropriation for general purpose aid for local 
31schools.  The commissioner shall distribute the increased state contribution amounts 
32on the basis of the essential programs and services formula set forth in this chapter.

9closer to meeting the applicable annual target specified in section 15752.  The department 
10shall post the report on its publicly accessible website.
