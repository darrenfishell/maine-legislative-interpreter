8a corrections officer must sign a written affidavit declaring, to the best of the corrections

14SUMMARY
15This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing corrections officers.
161.  It provides a supplemental benefit paid to a corrections officer who is injured by 
17the acts of a patient or prisoner of the jail, prison or state correctional facility where the 
18corrections officer works if the injury qualifies the corrections officer for workers' 
19compensation benefits.
202.  It amends the workers' compensation laws by including a rebuttable presumption 
21that a condition of impairment of health caused by an infectious disease resulting in total 
22or partial disability or death of a corrections officer is presumed to have been suffered in 
23the line of duty, unless it is shown otherwise.
243.  It amends the workers' compensation laws by including a rebuttable presumption 
25that heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer was caused in the 
26course of employment as a corrections officer, like the provisions of current law that 
27establish a rebuttable presumption that cancer contracted by a firefighter was caused by 
28exposure to carcinogens in the course of the firefighter's firefighting duties.
