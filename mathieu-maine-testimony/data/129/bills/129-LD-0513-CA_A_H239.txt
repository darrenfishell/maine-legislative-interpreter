Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Limiting the total enrollment at all authorized virtual public charter schools to 1,000 students and prohibiting the 
future expansion of grade levels served will not affect the total cost of public education from kindergarten to grade 12 
or the State's share of that cost. Additionally, this legislation will not impact the distribution of state subsidy to local 
school administrative units and public charter schools until the enrollment cap is reached and only if the student who 
would have enrolled in a virtual charter school if the cap had not been in place opts to emoll in a public high school 
instead of another charter school. Cmrently there are approximately 800 students emolled at authorized virtual public 
charter schools in the State.
