A. The victim or victims. who must be natural persons. or a dependent of a deceased 
victim. A juvenile's obligation to pay restitution is not affected by the death of the 
victim to whom the restitution is due. In the case of the death of a victim. the money 
collected as restitution must be forwarded to the estate of the victim: and 
B. Any person legally authorized to act on behalf of the victim. 
5. Burdens of proof. At a hearing on a juvenile's capacity to pay restitution, there 
exists a rebuttable presumption that a juvenile who has not attained 16 years of age lacks 
the capacity to pay restitution. The State has the burden to rebut that presumption by a 
preponderance of the evidence. At a hearing in which a juvenile who has attained 16 
years of age asserts a present or future incapacity to pay restitution. the juvenile has the 
burden of proving the incapacity to pay restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. 
On appeal of a restitution order. as part of a juvenile disposition. the juvenile has the 
burden of demonstrating that the court abused its discretion in ordering an amount of 
restitution. 
6. Modification of orders on juvenile restitution. This subsection governs the 
modification of juvenile restitution orders. 
A. A juvenile who is not able to make restitution payments in the manner ordered by 
the court shall move the court for a modification of the time or method of payment. 
If the juvenile establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile is 
unable to pay restitution in the time and manner ordered, the court may modify its 
prior order to reduce the amount of each installment or to allow additional time for 
payment. 
B. Upon motion of the juvenile. the juvenile's parent or parents or the juvenile's 
guardian. and upon notice to the State and providing an opportunity for the victim to 
comment on the motion, pursuant to Title 17-A. sections 2102. 2104 and 2105. the 
court may review the restitution order and may modify its dispositional order to 
reduce or eliminate the amount of restitution ordered when the court determines that 
the juvenile has established by a preponderance of the evidence that payment of the 
current restitution order would, based on a substantial change in the juvenile's 
circumstances, constitute an excessive financial hardship on the juvenile or the 
juvenile's dependents. Additionally. if a court determines that a juvenile's failure to 
pay restitution was not willful and was excusable, the court may order that the 
juvenile complete court-approved community service to offset the juvenile's 
restitution obligations at an hourly rate set by the court that may be no less than the 
minimum wage established in Title 26, section 664. 
7. Enforcement of an order of juvenile restitution. Notwithstanding section 3314, 
subsection 7. to enforce an order of restitution upon a finding that the juvenile has 
inexcusably failed to comply with the order. the court may not order confinement as a 
remedial or punitive contempt sanction unless the juvenile has in fact attained 16 years of 
age. Upon a motion by the State to enforce the payment of restitution. the court may 
order. in addition to other remedial or punitive contempt sanctions for an inexcusable 
failure to pay restitution. that a juvenile complete court-approved community service at 
an hourly rate set by the court that may be no less than the minimum wage established in 
Title 26, section 664.'

24 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/J" to H.P. 947, L.D. 1304 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It enacts a new section in the Maine Juvenile Code 
governing court orders of restitution and orders to modify restitution. The new section: 
1. Requires that restitution be considered by the court and, when the court does not 
order restitution, that the court state on the record or in writing the reasons for not 
imposing restitution; 
2. Establishes criteria that must be considered in determining whether restitution is 
appropriate and the amount of restitution to be paid. The amendment specifically 
prohibits an order ofrestitution in enumerated circumstances; 
3. Clarifies to whom restitution may be paid; 
4. Establishes who has the burden of proof with regard to the capacity to pay 
restitution. If the juvenile has not attained 16 years of age, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that the juvenile does not have the capacity to pay restitution; the State may 
rebut the presumption by a preponderance of evidence. If the juvenile is 16 years of age 
or older, the juvenile has the burden of proving the incapacity to pay restitution by a 
preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, the juvenile has the burden of demonstrating 
that the court abused its discretion in ordering an amount of restitution; 
5. Provides for the modification of orders of juvenile restitution; and 
6. Provides that, in enforcing an order to pay restitution, the court may not enter an 
order for confinement as a remedial or contempt sanction unless the juvenile has in fact 
attained 14 years of age. The court may also order the juvenile to complete community 
service.
