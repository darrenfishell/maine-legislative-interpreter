Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Prohibiting a person employed on a campaign by a ceitified candidate under the Maine Clean Election Act from 
being paid a salaiy and consulting fees in excess of $70,000 does not change the amount of funding a candidate will 
receive and spend for all purposes from the Maine Clean Election Fund. Any additional costs to the Commission on 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices to verify compliance with the new prohibition are antipated to be minor 
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
