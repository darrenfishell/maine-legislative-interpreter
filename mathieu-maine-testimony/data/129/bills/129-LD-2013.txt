2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3214, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 414, §1, is

42-A.  Arrearage management program.  Each investor-owned transmission and 
5distribution utility shall implement pursuant to this subsection an arrearage management 
6program to assist eligible low-income residential customers who are in arrears on their 
7electricity bills.  An arrearage management program implemented pursuant to this 
8subsection is a plan under which a transmission and distribution utility works with an 
9eligible low-income residential customer to establish an affordable payment plan and 
10provide credit to that customer toward the customer's accumulated arrears as long as that 
11customer remains in compliance with the terms of the program.  If a consumer-owned 
12transmission and distribution utility elects to implement an arrearage management 
13program, it must do so in accordance with this subsection and rules adopted pursuant to 
14this subsection.  The commission shall establish requirements relating to the arrearage 
15management programs by rule.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine 
16technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
17In adopting rules regarding arrearage management programs, the commission shall:
18A.  Consider best practices as developed and implemented in other states or regions;
19B.  Require that an arrearage management program include an electricity usage 
20assessment at no cost to the participant;
21D.  Ensure that a transmission and distribution utility develops terms and conditions 
22for its arrearage management program in a manner that is consistent with the 
23program's objectives and is in the best interests of all ratepayers; and
24E.  Ensure that a transmission and distribution utility recovers in rates all reasonable 
25costs of arrearage management programs, including:
26(1)  Incremental costs;
27(2)  Reconnection fees;
28(3)  Administrative costs;
29(4)  Marketing costs;
30(5)  Costs for any 3rd-party assistance it receives in administering its arrearage 
31management program; and
32(6)  Costs for providing financial and budgetary guidance to participants whether 
33provided directly or through a 3rd party contracted by the transmission and 
34distribution utility to provide that guidance.
35The amount of any arrearage forgiven that is treated as bad debt for purposes of cost 
36recovery by the transmission and distribution utility may not be included as a 
37reasonable cost under this paragraph.
38The Efficiency Maine Trust shall work with investor-owned transmission and distribution 
39utilities, consumer-owned transmission and distribution utilities that elect to participate in 
Page 2 - 129LR2825(01)-11an arrearage management program and other stakeholders to provide access to a 
2complementary low-income energy efficiency program for participants in arrearage 
3management programs in order to help reduce participants' energy consumption.
4No later than January 28, 2021 2022, the commission shall prepare a report assessing the 
5effectiveness of arrearage management programs, including the number of participants 
6enrolled in the programs, the number of participants completing the programs, the 
7number of participants who have failed to complete the programs, the payment patterns of 
8participating customers after completing the programs, the dollar amount of arrears 
9forgiven, a comparison of outcomes for those participating in the programs and those not 
10participating, the impact on any participating transmission and distribution utility's bad 
11debt as a result of the programs, the costs and benefits to all ratepayers associated with 
12the programs and recommendations for ways in which the programs might be improved 
13or continued for the benefit of all ratepayers.  In preparing its report, the commission 
14shall hold at least one formal stakeholder meeting involving affected parties, including 
15the Office of the Public Advocate and the participating transmission and distribution 
16utilities.  Parties must also be provided an opportunity to submit written comments to the 
17commission regarding the performance of the programs.
18The joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities matters 
19may report out a bill relating to the commission report to the First Second Regular 
20Session of the 130th Legislature.
21This subsection is repealed September 30, 2021 2022.
