SUMMARY 
The bill amends the laws concerning disclosures about residential real property when 
it is transferred to include information about chimneys and vents on the property, if they 
have not been inspected. This amendment replaces the bill to require that the residential 
real property disclosure include the date of the most recent inspection of the chimneys 
and vents for the system or source that is used to supply heat to the property. The 
amendment does not impose any inspection requirements.
