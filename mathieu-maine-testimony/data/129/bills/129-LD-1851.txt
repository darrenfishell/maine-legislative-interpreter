Page 1 - 129LR2577(01)-11Preamble.  Two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature deeming it necessary in 
2accordance with the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 14 to authorize the 
3issuance of bonds on behalf of the State of Maine to provide funds as described in this 
4Act,
5Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
6PART A
7Sec. A-1.  Authorization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized, under 
8the direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 
9amount not exceeding $20,000,000 for the purposes described in section 6 of this Part.  
10The bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for 
11a period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.
12Sec. A-2.  Records of bonds issued; Treasurer of State.  The Treasurer of 
13State shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, 
14the name of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the 
15date of sale and the date when payable.
16Sec. A-3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of 
17State may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may 
18be loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 
19bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 
20upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 
21forth in this Part.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion of the project 
22in this Part lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 
23general obligation bonds.
24Sec. A-4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay 
25interest due or accruing on any bonds issued under this Part and all sums coming due for 
26payment of bonds at maturity.
27Sec. A-5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds.  The proceeds of the bonds must be 
28expended as set out in this Part under the direction and supervision of the Department of 
29Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
301.  The proceeds of the bonds for the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 
31section 6 must be expended by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
32for acquisition of land and interest in land for conservation, water access, outdoor 
33recreation, wildlife or fish habitat, working farmland preservation in accordance with the 
34provisions for such acquisitions under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 
35and working waterfront preservation in accordance with the terms of Public Law 2005, 
36chapter 462, Part B, section 6, including all costs associated with such acquisitions, 
37except that use of the proceeds of these bonds is subject to the following conditions and 
38requirements.
39A.  Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on land 
40acquired with bond proceeds, except to the extent of applicable state, local or federal 
Page 2 - 129LR2577(01)-11laws, rules and regulations and except for working waterfront preservation projects 
2and working farmland preservation projects.
3B.  Payment from bond proceeds for acquisitions of land or interest in land for 
4community conservation projects as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
5section 6201, subsection 1-B may be made directly to cooperating entities as defined 
6in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2 for acquisition of land and interest in land by 
7cooperating entities, subject to terms and conditions enforceable by the State to 
8ensure its use for the purposes of this Part.
9C.  The bond funds expended for conservation, recreation, working waterfronts, 
10working farmland, community conservation projects and water access must be 
11matched with at least $20,000,000 in public and private contributions.  Seventy 
12percent of that amount must be in the form of cash or other tangible assets, including 
13the value of land and real property interest acquired by or contributed to cooperating 
14entities, as defined in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2, when property interests 
15have a direct relationship to the property proposed for protection, as determined by 
16the Land for Maine's Future Board.  The remaining 30% may be matching

20resiliency and mitigation strategies that benefit natural ecosystems, wildlife and 
21working waterfronts and farmland to adapt must be given special consideration by the 
22Land for Maine's Future Board.

24Part, 100% of the bond proceeds may be considered as state match for any federal 
25funding to be made available to the State.
262.  Because portions of the State have deer populations that are struggling and deer 
27wintering habitat protection is vital to the survival and enhancement of these populations, 
28projects that conserve and protect deer wintering areas are considered to have special 
29value and must receive preferential consideration during scoring of new applications for 
30support under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353.  The Department of 
31Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
32Wildlife shall take a proactive approach to pursuing land conservation projects that 
33include conservation of priority deer wintering areas, except for working waterfront 
34preservation projects and working farmland preservation projects.  Priority deer wintering 
35areas are of at least 500 acres or contiguous with existing conservation land so that the 
36combined acreage constitutes at least 500 acres, have been historically used by deer at 
37some point since 1950 and are capable of providing shelter for deer on the effective date 
38of this Part or within 20 years.  The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife shall 
39include in conservation negotiations under this section provisions for the appropriate 
40management of priority deer wintering areas.  Land and interest in land purchased by the

5section 6, at least 10% must be made available to protect farmland in accordance with the 
6Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 6207.  Funds under this subsection not spent
