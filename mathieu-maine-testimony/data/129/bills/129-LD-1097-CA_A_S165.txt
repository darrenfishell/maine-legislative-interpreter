F. Prior to being served with an eviction notice, provided the landlord or the 
landlord's agent with notice that the tenant or tenant's minor child is a victim7.;_m: 
G. Prior to being served with an eviction notice, communicated to the landlord or the 
landlord's agent about an act of sexual harassment or filed a complaint with a law 
enforcement agency, the Maine Human Rights Commission or a court of an act of 
sexual harassment by the landlord or the landlord's agent against the tenant or a 
family or household member of the tenant. 
If an action of forcible entry and detainer is brought for failure to pay rnnt or for causing 
substantial damage to the premises any reason set forth in section 6002, subsection 1 or 
for violation of a lease provision, the presumption of retaliation does not apply, unless the 
tenant has asserted a right pursuant to section 6026. 
No writ of possession may issue in the absence of rebuttal of the presumption of 
retaliation. 
Sec. 3. 14 MRSA §6001, sub-§6, ~-1 is enacted to read: 
D-1. A tenant who is the victim of sexual harassment by a landlord or the landlord's 
agent may terminate a lease as set forth in paragraph D if the tenant provides 
documentation set forth in paragraph H. 
Sec. 4. 14 MRSA §6016-A is enacted to read: 
§6016-A. Sexual harassment prohibited; Maine Human Rights Act 
A landlord or a landlord's agent may not subject a tenant to sexual harassment. 
Nothing in this subchapter limits the application of the Maine Human Rights Act.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
The bill addresses sexual harassment with regard to tenants in residential property. 
This amendment clearly states a landlord or a landlord's agent may not subject a tenant to 
sexual harassment. It retains the provision that nothing in the subchapter limits the 
application of the Maine Human Rights Act, which addresses discrimination in housing. 
The amendment revises the definition of "sexual harassment" to include retaliation 
for communicating about or filing a complaint of sexual harassment. 
The amendment replaces the rebuttable presumption that a forcible entry and detainer 
action was commenced in retaliation against a tenant with additional options for the 
tenant: the tenant raises the rebuttable presumption of retaliation by having 
communicated to the landlord or the landlord's agent about an act of sexual harassment or 
filed a complaint with a law enforcement agency, the Maine Human Rights Commission 
or a court of an act of sexual harassment by the landlord or the landlord's agent against 
the tenant or a family or household member of the tenant. The tenant must have made the 
communication, which does not have to be in writing, or complaint prior to receiving the

eviction notice. This is consistent with current law that creates a rebuttable presumption 
2 based on the tenant's filing a fair housing complaint prior to receiving an eviction notice. 
3 In addition, the amendment provides that the defense of retaliation cannot be used in 
4 an eviction if the action is brought because the tenant violated a lease provision or for any 
5 reason that is listed in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 14, section 6002, subsection 1 as 
6 grounds for an eviction with 7 days' written notice. Thus, if the landlord commences an 
7 eviction based on nonpayment of rent, for example, the fact that the tenant had 
8 communicated about sexual harassment or filed a complaint of sexual harassment does 
9 not create a presumption that the eviction is in retaliation for the assertion of that right. 
10 The amendment also provides a tenant who is the victim of sexual harassment by the 
11 landlord or the landlord's agent with the opportunity to terminate the lease early, using the 
12 same process currently in law for a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or 
13 stalking, by providing specified written documentation with appropriate notice.
