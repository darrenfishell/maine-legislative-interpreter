25the time that health care services are provided through telehealth.

Page 2 - 129LR0888(01)-11store and forward transfers and telemonitoring. "Telehealth" does not include the use 
2of audio-only telephone, facsimile machine, e-mail or texting.
3F.  "Telemonitoring," as it pertains to the delivery of health care services, means the 
4use of information technology to remotely monitor an enrollee's health status via 
5electronic means through the use of clinical data while the enrollee remains in a

9the use of telephone communication by a provider at a distance for the purpose of

112.  Parity for telehealth services.  A carrier offering a health plan in this State may 
12not deny coverage on the basis that the health care service is provided through telehealth 
13if the health care service would be covered if it was provided through in-person 
14consultation between an enrollee and a provider.  Coverage for health care services 
15provided through telehealth must be determined in a manner consistent with coverage for 
16health care services provided through in-person consultation.  If an enrollee is eligible for 
17coverage and the delivery of the health care service through telehealth is medically 
18appropriate, a carrier may not deny coverage for telehealth services. A carrier may offer a 
19health plan containing a provision for a deductible, copayment or coinsurance 
20requirement for a health care service provided through telehealth as long as the 
21deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or 
22coinsurance applicable to a comparable service provided through in-person consultation.   
23A carrier may not exclude a health care service from coverage solely because such health 
24care service is provided only through a telehealth encounter between the enrollee and the 
25provider and not through an in-person consultation between the enrollee and the provider, 
26as long as telehealth is appropriate for the provision of such health care service.
273.  Coverage for telehealth services.  Except as provided in this section, a carrier 
28shall provide coverage for any medically necessary health care service delivered through 
29telehealth as long as the following requirements are met.
30A.  The health care service is otherwise covered under an enrollee's health plan.
31B.  The health care service delivered by telehealth is of comparable quality to the 
32health care service delivered through in-person consultation.
33C.  Prior authorization is required for telehealth services only if prior authorization is 
34required for the corresponding covered health care service. An in-person consultation 
35prior to the delivery of services through telehealth is not required.
36D.  Coverage for telehealth services is not limited in any way on the basis of 
37geography, location or distance for travel.
38E.  The carrier shall require that a physical exam is conducted either in person or 
39through telehealth before a provider may write a prescription that is covered.
40F.  Coverage for a prescribed schedule I, II or III controlled substance, as defined in 
4121 United States Code, Section 812, is not permitted.
Page 3 - 129LR0888(01)-11G.  The carrier shall provide coverage for the treatment of 2 or more persons who are 
2enrolled in the carrier's health plan at the same time through telehealth, including 
3counseling for substance use disorders involving opioids.
44.  Telemonitoring requirements.  A carrier shall provide coverage for 
5telemonitoring if:
6A.  The telemonitoring is intended to collect an enrollee's health-related data, 
7including, but not limited to, pulse and blood pressure readings, that assist a provider 
8in monitoring and assessing the enrollee's medical condition;
9B.  A provider has evaluated an enrollee and determined that telemonitoring is 
10medically necessary for the enrollee;
11C.  A provider has evaluated an enrollee and determined that the enrollee is 
12cognitively and physically capable of operating the mobile health devices or 
13determined that the enrollee has a caregiver willing and able to assist with the mobile 
14health devices; and
15D.  A provider has evaluated an enrollee's residence and determined its suitability for 
16telemonitoring. If the residence appears unable to support telemonitoring, the 
17telemonitoring may not be provided unless necessary adaptations are made.
185.  Coverage for telephonic services.  A carrier shall provide coverage for 
19telephonic services when telehealth services are unavailable and the telephonic services 
20are medically appropriate for the corresponding covered health care services.
216.  Exclusions.  A carrier may exclude the following health care services from 
22coverage under a health plan in this State:
23A.  Health care services delivered via telehealth if those services are not otherwise 
24covered under a health plan;
25B.  Health care services that require direct physical contact with an enrollee by a 
26provider and that cannot be delegated to another provider at the enrollee originating 
27site; and
28C.  Any health care service that is medically inappropriate for delivery through 
29telehealth.
307.  Utilization review.  This section does not prohibit or limit a carrier from 
31conducting a utilization review for telehealth services as long as the utilization review is 
32conducted in the same manner and uses the same clinical review criteria as a utilization 
33review for an in-person consultation for the same service.
348.  Provider eligibility.  In order to be eligible for reimbursement under this section, 
35a provider providing health care services through telehealth must be acting within the 
36scope of the provider's license. A carrier may not impose additional credentialing 
37requirements or prior approval requirements for a provider as a condition of 
38reimbursement for health care services provided under this section unless those 
39credentialing requirements or prior approval requirements are the same as those imposed 
40for a provider that does not provide health care services through telehealth.
Page 4 - 129LR0888(01)-119.  Telehealth equipment.  A carrier may not require a provider to use specific 
2telecommunications technology and equipment as a condition of coverage under this 
3section as long as the provider uses telecommunications technology and equipment that 
4comply with current industry interoperability standards and that comply with standards 
5required under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 
6Public Law 104-191 and regulations promulgated under that Act.
7Sec. 3.  Application.  The requirements of this Act apply to all policies, contracts 
8and certificates executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this 
9State on or after January 1, 2020.  For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be 
10renewed no later than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
