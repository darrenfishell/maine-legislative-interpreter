10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, makes technical 
12 changes to the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Act established in the bill. The 
13 amendment clarifies that a ballot question committee that wishes to participate in the Act 
14 and that supports a direct initiative or people's veto may, in addition to collecting seed 
15 money contributions, collect a limited amount of contributions and make a limited 
16 amount of expenditures specifically for the purposes of gathering signatures on the ballot 
17 question petition. The amendment clarifies that a ballot question committee that wishes 
18 to participate in the Act may be involved in collecting signatures for only one ballot 
19 question at a time and may not expend any revenues distributed from the Maine Citizens' 
20 Initiatives Clean Election Fund on signature-gathering activities. 
21 The amendment also provides that the qualifying period, during which ballot question 
22 committees may collect qualifying contributions for certification under the Act, 
23 commences for all committees on the date that an application to initiate proceedings for a 
24 direct initiative or people's veto is filed with the Secretary of State under the Maine 
25 Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 901. 
26 The amendment adds an appropriations and allocations section.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Fund (the fund) within the Commission on 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices (CGEEP) to provide a public financing mechanism for groups that meet 
specific criteria to support or oppose a direct initiative of legislation or a people's veto or to support a competing 
measure to a direct initiative of legislation. A group must collect 2,500 qualifying contributions to receive an initial 
distribution of $600,000; for each additional 240 qualifying contributions the group will receive an additional $50,000 
up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000 per group. The fund will receive an annual transfer of $3,000,000 from the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund on or before January 1st of each year beginning January 1, 2020. Other 
funding will come from qualifying contributions raised by committees, voluntary contributions through a tax checkoff 
program, seed money contributions remaining unspent after a ballot question committee becomes a certified 
committee, fund revenues unspent after a referendum on a ballot question and certain fines collected related to the bill. 
The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $22,000 to the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services in fiscal year 2019-20 for programming costs to add two new voluntary checkoffs to the individual income tax 
return. The bill also includes allocations to the GCEEP of $750,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,500,000 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 for distribution of funds to certified committees and $23,614 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $24,270 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 for one limited-period position to process additional qualifying contributions and to assist with 
compliance monitoring. 
LR0284(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 2 
(JA-( JI-3/g) 2 of' 2-
The bill requires that the annual $3,000,000 transfers from the General Fund be offset by equivalent reductions in tax 
expenditures as defined in Title 36, section 199-A, subsection 2. As no guidance is provided in the bill on which tax 
expenditures will be eliminated nor on who will make that decision, and with no notwithstanding language to allow tax 
expenditures described in current statute to be eliminated, this fiscal note does not reflect any $3,000,000 offset to the 
~Mfe~. -
