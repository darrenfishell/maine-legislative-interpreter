Page 1 - 129LR2895(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, due to extensive waiting lists for both children's services and adult 
4services, targeted case management services are necessary to meet the essential health 
5needs of people with disabilities; and
6Whereas, for more than 250 families on the waiting list for Section 29 services, 
7targeted case management services are the only connection to essential support; and
8Whereas, the reimbursement rate for targeted case management services has not 
9been adjusted since 2009 despite rising costs of wages, health insurance, technology and 
10travel and other costs; and
11Whereas, case managers' duties and mandates have increased over the past decade 
12including required activities that are unreimbursed; and
13Whereas, the State discontinued its own case management services in 2017 and 
14increased the case load for targeted case management services delivered by community 
15providers by more than 1,200 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and
16Whereas, without an immediate increase in reimbursement to offset a decade of 
17inflation, providers will be unable to maintain the capacity needed to ensure individuals 
18with intellectual and developmental disabilities have access to targeted case management 
19services; and
20Whereas, it is therefore essential that the Department of Health and Human Services 
21amend its reimbursement rules to increase rates for targeted case management services no 
22later than April 1, 2020; and
23Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
24the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
25immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
26therefore, be it
27Sec. 1.  Department of Health and Human Services to amend rules. 
28Resolved:  That, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no later than 
29April 1, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services shall amend its rules in 
30Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 13, Targeted Case 
31Management Services to increase reimbursement rates for targeted case management 
32services by a percentage equivalent to the cumulative increase in costs measured by the 
33United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index 
34medical care services index in each year from 2010 to 2019.
35Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
36legislation takes effect when approved.

3rules governing MaineCare reimbursement for targeted case management services to
