Sec. 2. 26 MRSA §625-B, sub-§9, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 333, §2, is amended 
to read: 
9. Penalties. A person that violates subsection 2 commits a civil violation for which 
a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation may be adjudged. Each employee affected 
constitutes a separate violation. Any such fine may not be collected by the Department of

A person that violates subsection 6 or subsection 6-A commits a civil violation for which 
a fine of $500 per day may be adjudged, except that a fine may not be adjudged if the 
closing is necessitated by a physical calamity or the final order of a federal, state or local 
government agency, or if the failure to give notice is due to unforeseen circumstances. A 
fine imposed on a person that violates subsection 6-A may not be collected by the 
Department of Labor to the extent such collection prevents the violator from making all 
payments required under subsection 2.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and replaces it with changes to the law governing the 
notification requirements for an employer that proposes to close or relocate an industrial 
or commercial facility that employs 100 or more people. It changes the notification 
period from 60 days prior to the closure or relocation to 90 days prior, changes the civil 
penalty from a maximum $500 fine to a $500 per day fine and it applies this civil penalty 
to both failure to notify the Department of Labor and failure to notify the employees and 
the municipal officers of the municipality where the facility is located.
