This bill requires the Superintendent of Consumer Credit to designate a student loan ombudsman within the 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation (PFR) and establishes licensing and examination procedures for 
student loan services. PFR has indicated that the designation of a student loan ombudsman position can be fulfilled by 
an existing position and no additional personal services funds are needed for this purpose. PFR anticipates increased 
costs associated with the licensing, examination and investigation of student loan servicers. These costs include travel, 
training, supplies and general operating expenses. Accordingly, the bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocations of $9,300 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $18,600 in fiscal year 2020-21, assuming an effective date of January 
1, 2020. This increase in allocation coincides with additional revenues collected by PFR from an estimated 39 license 
applications and 5 examinations per year. 
Additional costs to the Finance Authority of Maine to assist the student loan ombudsman with complaints can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
