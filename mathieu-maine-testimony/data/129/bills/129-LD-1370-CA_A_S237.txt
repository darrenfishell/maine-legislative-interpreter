14 'Mandate preamble. This measure requires one or more local units of government

16 revenues but does not provide funding for at least 90% of those expenditures. Pursuant to 
17 the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 21, 2/3 of all of the members elected to

20 Sec.1. 20-A MRSA §6555 is enacted to read: 
21 §6555. Dangerous behavior prevention and intervention

29 harm to a student or others.

must be conducted by an administrator and an assigned public school employee. If the 
2 report of the incident of dangerous behavior is substantiated, the school administrative 
3 unit shall, in consultation with the public school employee who was subjected to the 
4 dangerous behavior, if any, develop an individualized response plan to avoid future 
5 dangerous behavior, which may include but is not limited to: 
6 A. Minimizing suspension and expulsion of the student; 
7 B. Prioritizing counseling and guidance services for the student and educators; 
8 C. Providing positive behavioral interventions and supports and supports designed to 
9 address the consequences of trauma in the individual and training for the student and 
10 educators; 
11 D. Restorative practices; 
12 E. Training for public school employees who interact with the student; and 
13 F. Provision of adequate staffing and professional development necessary to 
14 implement the plan. 
15 Nothing in this subsection may be construed as limiting any federally protected right of a 
16 student, including, but not limited to, federally protected rights of students with 
17 disabilities. 
18 Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a student 
19 eligible for services under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or 
20 protected from discrimination under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 
21 1973, any discussions or actions related to the identification, evaluation or educational 
22 placement of the student or provision of a free, appropriate public education to the 
23 student must take place through the processes established under federal law. 
24 Sec. 2. 20-A MRSA §13601, sub-§5 is enacted to read: 
25 5. Injuries caused by dangerous behavior. A school administrative unit may not 
26 count time away from work against a public school employee's accrued sick leave if the 
27 time away from work is due to an injury caused by dangerous behavior and a physician 
28 has determined that the public school employee is unable to work as a result of the injury 
29 sustained. For the purposes of this subsection, "dangerous behavior" has the same 
30 meaning as in section 6555, subsection 1, paragraph C.' 
31 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
32 section number to read consecutively.
