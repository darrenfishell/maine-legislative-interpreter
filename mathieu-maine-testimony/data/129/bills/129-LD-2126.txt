1.  Career and technical education program components.  Beginning in fiscal year 11 
2018-19, the allocation for career and technical education centers and career and 12 
technical education regions is based upon a model that recognizes program components 13 
that have been approved by the department pursuant to chapter 313 for: 14 
A.  Direct instruction.  The direct instruction component includes personnel costs for 15 
teachers, education technicians for programs and clinical supervisors for health care 16 
programs.  The allocation for direct instruction is the sum of the costs as determined 17 
based on the following components, which the commissioner shall determine 18 
annually: 19 
(1)  A teacher salary matrix.  In determining the teacher salary matrix for each 20 
program, the commissioner shall give consideration to the most recent available 21 
data regarding years of education experience and years of professional work 22 
experience relevant to instructional assignment; 23 
(2)  Student-to-teacher ratios for each program; 24 
(3)  The number of education technicians required for purposes of instructional 25 
support, based on student enrollment and program requirements.  The 26 
commissioner shall calculate the education technician allocation by multiplying 27 
the number of education technicians required by the statewide average salary for 28 
full-time education technicians, based on the most recent available salary data, 29 
but shall ensure that each career and technical education center or career and 30 
technical education region is allocated at least one full-time education technician; 31 
and 32 
(4)  The clinical supervision staffing level necessary for each program requiring 33 
such staffing, based on student enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph 34 
G; 35 
B.  Central administration.  The central administration component includes personnel 36 
costs for directors, assistant directors and clerical staff working in career and 37 
technical education centers and career and technical education regions, as well as 38 
business managers working in career and technical education regions.  The central 39 
administration allocation is the sum of: 40 
(1)  Costs for personnel for each career and technical education center and career 41 
and technical education region, as follows: 42 
 
 Page 100  - 129LR3206(01)-1 
 (a)  A director, the allocation for which must be for one full-time equivalent; 1 
(b)  An assistant director, the allocation for which must be based on student 2 
enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph G but may not exceed one 3 
full-time equivalent; 4 
(c)  Clerical staff, the allocation for which must be for at least one full-time 5 
equivalent, with additional clerical staff allocations based on student 6 
enrollment as determined pursuant to paragraph G; 7 
(d)  A career and technical education region business manager, the allocation 8 
for which must be for one full-time equivalent; and 9 
(e)  Benefit costs for employees in central administration, which must be 10 
calculated pursuant to section 15678, subsection 5, paragraph B; and 11 
(2)  Nonpersonnel costs, which the commissioner shall calculate annually based 12 
upon the relationship of the most recent available career and technical education 13 
expenditures for nonpersonnel costs to personnel costs; 14 
C.  Supplies and other expenditures such as purchased services, dues and fees for 15 
instructional programs.  The allocation for supplies and other expenditures is the sum 16 
of: 17 
(1)  A per-program allocation for supplies, as determined by the commissioner 18 
based on the most recent available career and technical education expenditures 19 
amount, adjusted to the year prior to the allocation year; and 20 
(2)  A per-pupil allocation for each student in each career and technical education 21 
center and each career and technical education region, determined by the 22 
commissioner based on: 23 
(a)  The most recent available career and technical education expenditures 24 
amount, adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year; and 25 
(b)  Student enrollment, as determined pursuant to paragraph G; 26 
D.  Plant operation and maintenance, including all costs for operating and 27 
maintaining buildings and grounds.  The commissioner shall determine the allocation 28 
for plant operation and maintenance costs for each career and technical education 29 
center and each career and technical education region by multiplying the square 30 
footage of the career and technical education center or career and technical education 31 
region building by an amount per square foot, as determined by the commissioner; 32 
E.  Other student and staff support, which includes costs for student services 33 
coordination, career preparation, instructional technology, professional development, 34 
student assessment and program safety.  The other student and staff support 35 
allocation is the sum of the costs for: 36 
(1)  A counselor, the allocation for which must be for one full-time equivalent, to 37 
collaborate with sending school guidance counselors in order to maximize 38 
student participation at the middle school and high school grade levels; 39 
(2)  Career and technical education center or career and technical education 40 
region student services coordinators, the allocation for which must be based on 41 
 
 Page 101  - 129LR3206(01)-1 
 student enrollment, as determined pursuant to paragraph G, but no less than one 1 
full-time equivalent; 2 
(3)  Benefit costs for employees under this paragraph, calculated pursuant to 3 
section 15678, subsection 5, paragraph B; and 4 
(4)  Instructional technology, staff professional development, student assessment 5 
and program safety.  The commissioner shall calculate a per-pupil allocation for 6 
this allocation based upon student enrollment, as determined pursuant to 7 
paragraph G, and the relationship of the most recent available career and 8 
technical education expenditures for these costs to total costs, adjusted to the year 9 
prior to the allocation year; 10 
F.  Equipment provided pursuant to subsection 6; and 11 
G.  Student enrollment, which is determined as follows. 12 
(1)  For each program or plan approved pursuant to chapter 313 that has 3 years 13 
of attending student counts on October 1st, student enrollment is a 3-year average 14 
of the attending student counts on October 1st for that program or plan. 15 
(2)  For each program or plan approved pursuant to chapter 313 that is not 16 
governed by subparagraph (1), including a new program or plan approved 17 
pursuant to chapter 313, student enrollment must be based on the estimated 18 
attending student count submitted in accordance with the application for the 19 
program or plan approval.  This estimated attending student count must be used 20 
until the program or plan has 3 consecutive years of actual attending student 21 
counts on October 1st. 22 
In fiscal year 2019-20, the total allocation for a career and technical education center or 23 
career and technical education region is the sum of the components in paragraphs A to E, 24 
except if the sum of the components in paragraphs A to E is less than the most recent 25 
expenditure data, as adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year, the 26 
career and technical education center or career and technical education region may not 27 
receive less than the adjusted expenditure, and if the sum of the components in 28 
paragraphs A to E is more than 5% greater than the most recent expenditure data, as 29 
adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year, then the career and technical 30 
education center or career and technical education region may not receive more than the 31 
adjusted expenditures plus 5%. 32 
In fiscal year 2020-21, fiscal year 2021-22 and fiscal year 2022-23, the total allocation for 33 
a career and technical education center or career and technical education region is the 34 
sum of the components in paragraphs A to E, except if the sum of the components in 35 
paragraphs A to E is less than the most recent expenditure data, as adjusted for inflation 36 
to the year prior to the allocation year, or more than the most recent expenditure data, as 37 
adjusted for inflation to the year prior to the allocation year, the total allocation must be 38 
determined pursuant to subsection 1-A.  If the sum of the components in paragraphs A to 39 
E is more than 15% greater than the most recent expenditure data, as adjusted for 40 
inflation to the year prior to the allocation year, the career and technical education center 41 
or career and technical education region may not receive more than the adjusted 42 
expenditures plus 15%. 43 
 
 Page 102  - 129LR3206(01)-1 
 Beginning in fiscal year 2023-24, the total allocation for a career and technical education 1 
center or career and technical education region is the sum of components in paragraphs A 2 
to E. 3 
The commissioner shall authorize monthly payment of allocations to career and technical 4 
education centers and career and technical education regions in an amount equal to 1/12 5 
of the total allocation.  Payments for satellite programs as approved pursuant to chapter 6 
313 must be made within this schedule to the responsible career and technical education 7 
center or career and technical education region; it is the responsibility of the career and 8 
technical education center or career and technical education region to provide the state 9 
support for the approved satellite program to the school administrative unit that operates 10 
the approved satellite program. 11 
If a school administrative unit operating a career and technical education center or career 12 
and technical education region has any unexpended funds at the end of the fiscal year, 13 
these funds must be carried forward for the purposes of career and technical education. 14

A, §2, is further amended to read: 24 
A.  The standard rate of contributions is 5.4%.  A contributing employer's rate may 25 
not be varied from the standard rate unless the employer's experience rating record 26 
has been chargeable with benefits throughout the period of 24 consecutive calendar 27 
months ending on the computation date applicable to such a year.  A contributing 28 
employer newly subject to this chapter shall pay contributions at a rate equal to the 29 
greater of the predetermined yield or 1.0% until the employer's experience rating 30 
record has been chargeable with benefits throughout the period of 24 consecutive 31 
calendar months ending on the computation date applicable to such a year.  For rate 32 
years thereafter, the employer's contribution rate is determined in accordance with 33 
this subsection and subsection 3. 34 
Effective January 1, 2008, the contribution rate must be reduced by the Competitive 35

Sec. EE-2.  26 MRSA §1221, sub-§4-A, ¶B, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. 3 
CCCCC, §5, is further amended to read: 4 
B.  Subject to paragraph A, an employer's contribution rate for the 12-month period 5 
commencing January 1st of each year is based upon the employer's experience rating 6 
record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.  The employer's reserve 7 
ratio is the percent obtained by dividing the amount, if any, by which the employer's 8 
contributions, credited from the time the employer first or most recently became an 9 
employer, whichever date is later, up to and including June 30th of the preceding 10 
year, including any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or 11 
before July 31st of that year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same 12 
period, by the employer's average annual payroll for the period of 36 consecutive 13 
months ending June 30th of the preceding year.  The employer's contribution rate is 14 
determined under subparagraphs (1) to (8). 15 
(1)  The commissioner shall prepare a schedule listing all employers for whom a 16 
reserve ratio has been computed pursuant to this paragraph, in the order of their 17 
reserve ratios, beginning with the highest ratio.  For each employer, the schedule 18 
must show: 19 
(a)  The amount of the employer's reserve ratio; 20 
(b)  The amount of the employer's annual taxable payroll; and 21 
(c)  A cumulative total consisting of the amount of the employer's annual 22 
taxable payroll plus the amount of the annual taxable payrolls of all other 23 
employers preceding the employer on the list. 24 
(2)  The commissioner shall segregate employers into contribution categories in 25 
accordance with the cumulative totals under subparagraph (1), division (c).  The 26 
contribution category is determined by the cumulative payroll percentage limits 27 
in column B.  Each contribution category is identified by the contribution 28 
category number in column A that is opposite the figures in column B, which 29 
represent the percentage limits of each contribution category.  If an employer's 30 
taxable payroll falls in more than one contribution category, the employer must 31 
be assigned to the lower-numbered contribution category, except that an 32 
employer may not be assigned to a higher contribution category than is assigned 33 
any other employer with the same reserve ratio. 34

(3-A)  Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner shall compute a reserve 19 
multiple to determine the schedule and planned yield in effect for a rate year. The 20 
reserve multiple is determined by dividing the fund reserve ratio by the average 21 
benefit cost rate. The determination date is October 31st of each calendar year.  22 
The schedule and planned yield that apply for the 12-month period commencing 23 
on January 1, 2008 and every January 1st thereafter are shown on the line of the 24 
following table that corresponds with the applicable reserve multiple in column 25

 must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%.  The employer's experience 1 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) that 2 
corresponds with the employer's contribution category in column A, except that 3 
the experience factors in column E must be used to determine the contribution 4 
rates for rate years 2000 and 2001 and those in column D must be used for rate 5 
years 2002 and 2003.  Beginning January 1, 2018, for rate years when schedule A 6 
is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3-A), the experience factor in 7 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of 8 
0.00 in column C. 9 
(6)  If, subsequent to the assignment of contribution rates for a rate year, the 10 
reserve ratio of an employer is recomputed and changed, the employer must be 11 
placed in the position on the schedule prepared pursuant to subparagraph (1) that 12 
the employer would have occupied had the corrected reserve ratio been shown on 13 
the schedule.  The altered position on the schedule does not affect the position of 14 
any other employer. 15 
(7)  In computing the contribution rates, only the wages reported by employers 16 
liable for payment of contributions into the fund and net benefits paid that are 17 
charged to an employer's experience rating record or to the fund are considered in 18 
the computation of the average benefit cost rate and the ratio of total wages to 19 
taxable wages. 20 
(8)  Beginning January 1, 2008, all contribution rates must be reduced by the 21 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund predetermined yield as defined in section 22 
1166, subsection 1, paragraph C, except that contribution category 20 under this 23 
paragraph may not be reduced below 5.4%. 24 
(9)  Beginning January 1, 2021, the contribution rate must also be reduced by the 25 
Unemployment Administrative Fund predetermined yield as defined in section 26 
1167, subsection 1, paragraph C, except that a contribution rate under this 27 
paragraph may not be reduced below 1%. 28

the United States Secretary of the Treasury on July 29, 2009 pursuant to Section 903(f) of 5 
the federal Social Security Act may not be requisitioned from the State's account or used 6 
except for the payment of benefits and for the payment of expenses incurred for the 7 
administration of the State's unemployment compensation law and public employment 8 
offices.  Money used for the payment of benefits is requisitioned as defined in the Maine 9 
Revised Statutes, Title 26, section 1162.  Money requisitioned and used for the payment 10 
of expenses incurred for the administration of the State's unemployment compensation 11 
law and public employment offices requires a specific appropriation by the Legislature as 12 
provided in section 2.  That use is only permissible if the expenses are incurred and the 13 
money is requisitioned after the effective date of a law making an appropriation and 14 
specifying the purposes for which the money is appropriated and the amounts 15 
appropriated for those purposes.  Any amount that may be obligated under such an 16 
appropriation is limited to an amount that does not exceed the amount by which the 17 
aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of the State of Maine pursuant to 18 
Section 903(f) of the federal Social Security Act exceeds the aggregate of the amounts 19 
used by the State pursuant to this Act and charged against the amounts transferred to the 20 
account of the State of Maine. 21 
For purposes of this section, the amounts obligated under an appropriation for 22 
administrative purposes must be charged against transferred amounts at the exact time the 23 
obligation is entered into.  The appropriation, obligation and expenditure or other 24 
disposition of money appropriated under this section must be accounted for in accordance 25 
with standards established by the United States Secretary of Labor.  Money appropriated 26 
as provided in this Act for the payment of administration must be requisitioned as needed 27 
for the payment of obligations incurred under the appropriation and, upon requisition, 28 
must be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund from which 29 
payments are made.  Money so deposited must, until expended, remain a part of the 30 
unemployment fund and, if it will not be immediately expended, must be returned 31 
promptly to the account of the State of Maine in the federal Unemployment Trust Fund. 32
