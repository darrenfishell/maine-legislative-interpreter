2Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §901, as enacted by PL 1981, c. 270, §4, is amended to read:
3§901.  Legislative findings and purpose
4The Legislature finds that alternative working hours, including part-time work, job 
5sharing and more flexible work schedules will lead to greater efficiency by state 
6employees. There are many qualified and talented Maine citizens of all ages whose 
7personal responsibilities make it difficult to work full time or during the traditional hours 
8of employment.  The Legislature also finds that telework eliminates or substantially 
9reduces the physical commute to and from an employee's usual work site.
10Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §902, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
115.  Telework.  "Telework" means a flexible work arrangement under which an 
12employee performs the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position from a 
13location other than the office or location provided by the employer.
14Sec. 3.  5 MRSA §904 is enacted to read:
15§904.  Telework
161.  Telework rate.  The Director of Human Resources shall ensure that at least 30% 
17of state employees are teleworking by January 1, 2030.
182.  Employees in collective bargaining units.  The Governor, or the Governor's 
19designee who negotiates a collective bargaining agreement, may bargain and conclude 
20agreements, pursuant to Title 26, chapter 9-B, that include provisions for telework.
213.  Employees not in collective bargaining units.  The Director of Human 
22Resources shall adopt rules to implement telework for persons who are not in collective 
23bargaining units.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as 
24defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
254.  Report.  The Department of Administrative and Financial Services shall report 
26annually to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over state 
27and local government matters the State's progress in implementing this section.  The 
28report must, at a minimum, contain a breakdown of the number of employees seeking 
29telework and the number of employees teleworking by department, the increase or 
30decrease in the number of such employees from the preceding year by department, an 
31estimate of savings achieved or costs imposed and a narrative summary of the efforts 
32taken by the State to encourage the development of telework.
33Sec. 4.  Maine Revised Statutes headnote amended; revision clause.  In the 
34Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 69, in the chapter headnote, the words 
35"alternative working hours" are amended to read "alternative working hours and 
36telework" and the Revisor of Statutes shall implement this revision when updating, 
37publishing or republishing the statutes.
