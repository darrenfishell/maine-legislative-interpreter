22 of a preapproval benefit to avoid creating an unfunded actuarial liability; specifies that 
23 independent medical examinations may take place at the health care provider's office or 
24 facility; and requires the retirement system to report to the joint standing committee of the 
25 Legislature having jurisdiction over retirement matters on the experience of the 
26 retirement system and its members under the changes. The amendment also requires 
27 formation of a stakeholder group to report to the joint standing committee of the 
28 Legislature having jurisdiction over retirement matters on implementing mandatory long-
29 term disability insurance coverage.
