Regarding the Timeliness of Payments to the State" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in § 131 by striking out all of subsection 2 (page 1, lines

'2. Certain payments not immediate. Notwithstanding subsection 1,. payments 
from a department or agency of the State made to the State Treasury through the use of 
automated procedures, electronic processes and computer-driven technology must be 
deposited in the State Treasury in accordance with the requirements established in rules 
adopted by the Treasurer of State and the State Controller. The Treasurer of State and the 
State Controller shall adopt rules to implement this subsection, including rules outlining 
procedures for the use of automated procedures, electronic processes and 
computer-driven technology for the collection of these payments pursuant to this 
subsection. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection may not waive prohibitions against 
deductions on account of salaries, fees, costs, charges, expenses, refunds, claims or 
demands of any description whatsoever. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are 
major substantive rules as defined by section 8071.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively.

This amendment clarifies that the bill applies to payments from departments and 
agencies of the State to the State Treasury. It removes the 3-day requirement for
