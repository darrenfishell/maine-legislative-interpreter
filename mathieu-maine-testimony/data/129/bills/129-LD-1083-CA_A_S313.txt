Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
The bill provides for ranked-choice voting for general elections for presidential electors if a law establishing a 
presidential primary election is enacted in Maine. Ranked-choice voting is currently in place for state primary 
elections and general elections for federal Congressional candidates. Requiring ranked-choice voting for general 
elections for presidential electors is not expected to add significant costs for this expansion.
