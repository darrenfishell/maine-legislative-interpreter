change in processing that materially increases the risk to consumers. The risk assessment

the controller's processor, including the extent to which the personal data is sensitive data 
or otherwise sensitive in nature, and the context in which the personal data is being 
processed. Risk assessments conducted under this subsection must identify and weigh

employed by the controller or the controller's processor to reduce such risks. The use of 
de.identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of

General upon request. A risk assessment conducted under this subsection is confidential 
and not a public record pursuant to Title 1, section 402, subsection 3 .. 
2. Consumer consent requirements. If the risk assessment conducted under 
subsection 1 determines that the potential risks to consumer privacy are substantial and
