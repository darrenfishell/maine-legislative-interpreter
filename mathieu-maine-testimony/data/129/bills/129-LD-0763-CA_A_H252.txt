This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$2,681,104 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to increase existing reimbursement rates in the Department of Health 
and Human Services rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 17 for community 
integration services. 
This estimate assumes all costs will be covered by General Fund appropriations because of PL 2017 c. 460, which 
increased rates for services in sections 17, 23 and 65, which are included in the Clinic Upper Payment Limit 
calculations. The impact of those increases put the department at or slightly above the amount allowed to be paid by 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result, the rate increase in this bill will be paid with state 
General Fund money only.
