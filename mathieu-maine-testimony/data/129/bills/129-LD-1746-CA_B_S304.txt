SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the language that allows an office, board or commission to 
discipline a licensee for failure to provide treatment records in a reasonable amount of 
time to instead reference the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 1711 and Title 22, 
section 1711-B. The amendment amends Title 22, section 1711 and Title 22, section 
1711-B to reference the requirements of the federal Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 regarding access to patient records.
