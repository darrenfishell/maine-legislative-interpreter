16SUMMARY
17This bill moves the Maine Library of Geographic Information, the Geolibrary, from 
18the Department of Administrative and Financial Services to the Department of 
19Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and establishes the Maine Library of Geographic 
20Information Board in the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 
21administer the Geolibrary.  This bill adds a Geolibrarian and a GIS information officer, 
22appointed by the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, to the staff of 
23the Maine Library of Geographic Information, to collect, perserve and disseminate data, 
24manage funds and direct the Geolibrary's activities.  The bill repeals language allowing 
25the administrator of the Office of Geographic Information Systems to enter into 
26agreements with other agencies and to accept funds from public and private 
27organizations, repeals language describing licensing agreement and fee requirements for 
28geographic information system data and repeals language allowing the Maine Library of 
29Geographic Information Board to hear and resolve disputes related to geographic 
30information system data.
