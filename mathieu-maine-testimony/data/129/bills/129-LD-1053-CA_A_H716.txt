SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which provides that a judgment or decree based 
upon a consumer obligation would be irrebuttably presumed to be paid and satisfied at the 
end of one year after any duty or obligation accrued by virtue of the judgment or decree 
unless within that period the judgment creditor has commenced other action as permitted 
by law for the enforcement of the judgment or decree. 
Instead, this amendment provides that an execution lien created on or after September 
1, 2020, for any underlying judgment, expires at the end of 10 years unless it is renewed 
before the expiration of the 10-year period. The renewal period is also 10 years. The lien 
can be renewed once. 
The amendment provides that the current law, which provides for a 20-year duration 
and a 20-year renewal period, applies to liens created before September 1, 2020.
