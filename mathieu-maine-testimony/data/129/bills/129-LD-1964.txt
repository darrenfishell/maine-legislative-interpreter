30§3308-C.  Confidentiality of juvenile case records
311.  Confidentiality.  Juvenile case records are confidential and may not be disclosed, 
32disseminated or inspected except as expressly authorized by this Part.
332.  Juvenile petitions open to public inspection.  Unless Juvenile Court proceedings 
34are suspended pursuant to section 3318-A, subsection 5, the following juvenile petitions 
35are open to public inspection:
36A.  Any juvenile petition alleging a violation of Title 17-A, section 201, 202 or 203 
37subsequent to the juvenile's first appearance in the Juvenile Court if the juvenile 
38involved has attained 13 years of age at the time of the alleged juvenile crime and the 
Page 5 - 129LR2605(01)-11court finds there is probable cause to believe the juvenile has committed the juvenile 
2crime alleged.  If the juvenile involved has not attained 13 years of age at the time of 
3the alleged juvenile crime, the Juvenile Court may allow public inspection of the 
4juvenile petition pursuant to paragraph B; and
5B.  Any petition alleging a juvenile crime that would constitute murder, a violation of 
6Title 17-A, section 204 or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were an 
7adult, when:
8(1)  The juvenile has had a first appearance with respect to the petition in the 
9Juvenile Court;
10(2)  The prosecuting attorney requests in writing that the juvenile petition be open 
11to public inspection;
12(3)  The Juvenile Court finds there is probable cause to believe the juvenile 
13committed a juvenile crime that would constitute murder, a violation of Title 
1417-A, section 204 or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were an 
15adult; and
16(4)  After notice to the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or parents, guardian or 
17legal custodian and a hearing in which the Juvenile Court considers the purposes 
18of this Part, the alleged victim's interest in privacy, the nature of the juvenile 
19crime alleged and the characteristics of the juvenile and public safety concerns as 
20outlined in section 3101, subsection 4, paragraph D, the court determines that the 
21general public's right to information substantially outweighs the juvenile's interest 
22in privacy.
23The names and identifying information regarding any alleged minor victims must be 
24redacted prior to allowing inspection of any juvenile petition.
25When the State files a request to allow public inspection of a petition under this 
26subsection, the Juvenile Court shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or 
27parents, guardian or legal custodian of the potential consequences of juvenile case records 
28being available to the public and the juvenile's right to be represented by counsel.
293.  Orders of adjudication open to public inspection.  Orders of adjudication for 
30any juvenile crime that would constitute murder or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile 
31involved were an adult are open to public inspection.  Orders of adjudication for all other 
32juvenile crimes are confidential and not open to public inspection.  When an order of 
33adjudication reflects adjudications for both a juvenile crime that would constitute murder 
34or a Class A, B or C crime if the juvenile involved were an adult and another juvenile 
35crime or crimes, information regarding any additional juvenile crimes must be redacted 
36before allowing public inspection of the order of adjudication.

28creating or maintaining an individualized plan for the juvenile's rehabilitation, 
29including reintegration into a school.

31disclosed or disseminated, except as otherwise provided by law.

7Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, juvenile case records

12(3)  There are no current adjudicatory proceedings pending for a juvenile or other 
13crime.
14B.  The court may grant the petition if it finds that the requirements of paragraph A 
15are satisfied, unless it finds that the general public's right to information substantially 
16outweighs the juvenile's interest in privacy.
17C.  Notwithstanding subsection 4, paragraphs E and G and subsections 5 and 6, a 
18court order sealing juvenile case records pursuant to this subsection permits only the 
19following persons to have access to the sealed records:

21(2)  The person whose juvenile case records are sealed or that person's designee.

37SUMMARY
38This bill defines "confidential juvenile history record information" and "public 
39juvenile history record information" and creates statutory authority governing the 
40dissemination of juvenile history record information by a Maine criminal justice agency 
Page 12 - 129LR2605(01)-11to create consistency between which juvenile case records may be open to public 
2inspection at the courts and information that may be shared publicly by a criminal justice 
3agency.
4It modifies the Maine Juvenile Code to limit access to juvenile case records and 
5reorganize existing provisions based on whether they allow disclosure of a juvenile's 
6identity, allow inspection of juvenile case records, allow dissemination of juvenile case 
7records or allow the general public access to Juvenile Court proceedings.  It provides that 
8a victim or an agent of the victim may inspect the juvenile petition and order of 
9adjudication regardless of whether the general public may do so.
10This bill allows automatic public inspection of juvenile petitions only if the petition 
11alleges murder, felony murder or manslaughter and the juvenile has attained 13 years of 
12age at the time of the offense.  Petitions alleging that a juvenile under 13 years of age has 
13committed murder, felony murder, manslaughter, aiding or soliciting suicide or any crime 
14that would be a Class A, B or C crime may be open to public inspection only if 
15authorized by court order.  Juvenile petitions may be open to public inspection only after 
16the juvenile's first appearance in the Juvenile Court to ensure that the Juvenile Court has 
17determined there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the crime alleged 
18and there is no assertion that the juvenile is not competent to proceed in the Juvenile 
19Court.
20It provides that only orders of adjudication for juvenile crimes that would constitute 
21murder or Class A, B or C crimes if the juvenile were an adult are open to public 
22inspection and dissemination by a court or criminal justice agency.
23It clarifies that the general public may not be excluded from any Juvenile Court 
24proceeding when a juvenile petition is open to public inspection pursuant to statute or 
25court order.  A victim or an agent of the victim may be present at all court proceedings 
26regardless of whether the proceeding is open to the general public.
27It makes all juvenile case records and all Juvenile Court proceedings confidential 
28when Juvenile Court proceedings are suspended due to an assertion by the juvenile, the 
29State or the court that the juvenile may not be competent to proceed in the Juvenile Court.  
30Juvenile case records and Juvenile Court proceedings remain confidential unless the 
31Juvenile Court proceedings resume after the juvenile is found competent.
