Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill requires school administrative units (SAU's) that have at least one public school in which at least 50% of 
students qualified for a free or reduced-price lunch during the preceding school year to participate in the federal child 
and adult care food program to serve at-risk students who attend after-school programming. The SAU may choose not 
to participate if it determines by a vote of the goveming body of the SAU that operating the program would be 
financially or logistically impracticable. 
This legislation requires the Department of Education to assist SAU's in developing a plan to patiicipate in the 
program and to obtain federal, state and private funding to pay for the program. The department indicates it has 
sufficient staff and resources within its current budget to acco1mnodate a 25% increase in the number of SAU's 
participating in the federal child and adult care food program. The department may require additional staff if the 
increase in the number of new patiicipants in the program exceeds 25%.
