4The purpose of this chapter is to reduce the toxicity of packaging and packaging 
5waste without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of post-consumer materials in 
6the production of packaging and its components.  Under this chapter, reduction of the 
7toxicity in packaging and packaging waste is accomplished by prohibiting the 
8unnecessary addition of heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent 
9chromium, and other chemicals of concern, such as PFAS and phthalates, in packaging 
10and packaging components.

33SUMMARY
34This bill amends the laws regarding the reduction of toxics in packaging to prohibit 
35the sale of food packaging to which phthalates have been intentionally introduced, 
36effective January 1, 2022.  It also authorizes the Department of Environmental Protection 
37to by rule prohibit the sale of food packaging to which perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
38substances, or PFAS, have been intentionally introduced upon a determination by the 
Page 7 - 129LR1184(01)-11department that a safer alternative to the intentionally introduced PFAS is available, 
2except that such prohibition may not take effect until January 1, 2022 or 2 years 
3following the department's determination that a safer alternative is available, whichever is 
4later.
5The bill provides an exemption from these prohibitions for a manufacturer of a food 
6or beverage product that has annual national sales of all food and beverage products 
7produced by the manufacturer of less than one billion dollars.  It also authorizes the 
8department to designate additional chemicals of concern in food packaging; to require 
9manufacturers of food packaging that use such designated chemicals to report regarding 
10its use of the chemical and the availability of safer alternatives; and to prohibit the sale of 
11food packaging to which a designated chemical of concern has been intentionally 
12introduced if safer alternatives are reasonably available, effective and affordable to the 
13consumer.
