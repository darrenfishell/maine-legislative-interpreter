Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential redistribution of state subsidy -local school administrative units 
Allowing the parent or guardian of a student to make a written request for the student to be transferred from their 
cunent school administrative unit (SAU) to another SAU for any reason other than participation in athletic programs 
may result in an increase in the number of designations that will need to be completed by the Depattment of 
Education. The cost to the department, and the ability to absorb that cost without impacting existing programs and 
services, will depend on the number of designations requested each school year. 
This legislation may also result in a redistribution of state subsidy to local SAU's with those SA U's experiencing 
higher enrollment due to this provision receiving more state subsidy and those SAU's experiencing lower enrollment 
receiving less. The impact to individual SAU's will depend on the net change in enrollment due to approved transfers.
