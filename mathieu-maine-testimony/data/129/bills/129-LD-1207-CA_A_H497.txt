Allowing detectives employed in the office of investigations within the Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau 
of Motor Vehicles, on or after July 1, 2020 to participate in the 1998 Special Plan of the Maine Public Employees 
Retirement System will increase both tlie normal cost and unfunded actuarial liability components of the employer 
retirement rate, resulting in increased employer contributions to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System for 
detectives beginning in fiscal year 2020-21. 
This legislation includes a transition provision for those detectives hired by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles prior to 
July 1, 2020 which allows these employees to elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan by September 30, 2020. 
Based on an analysis performed by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, this fiscal note assumes that 8 of 
the 13 eligible detectives (including one new detective position proposed to be added in the 2020-2011 biennial 
budget) will elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan as soon as the option becomes available and the remaining 
detectives will opt to stay in the State Regular Plan. This bill includes a Highway Fund allocation of $21,910 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles for the cost associated with moving the positions to the 1998 Special 
Plan. 
If any of the detectives hired by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles prior to July 1, 2020 who choose to remain in the State 
Regular Plan eventually retire or otherwise vacate their positions, any newly hired detectives will be placed in the 
1998 Special Plan. The additional cost to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to fill these positions at the higher employer. 
contribution rate is estimated to be between $2,000 and $3,000 per position annually. When this additional cost will 
be incurred and which fund will be impacted cannot be determined at this time.
