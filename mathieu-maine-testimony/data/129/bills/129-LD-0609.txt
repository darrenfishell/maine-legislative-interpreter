5sections 1811 and 1819 to the sale price on all sales of tangible personal property and 
6taxable services that are subject to tax under this Part. The tax when so added is a debt of 
7the purchaser to the retailer until it is paid and is recoverable at law by the retailer from 
8the purchaser in the same manner as the sale price. When the sale price involves a 
9fraction of a dollar, the tax computation must be carried to the 3rd decimal place, then 
10rounded down to the next whole cent whenever the 3rd decimal place is one, 2, 3 or 4 and 
11rounded up to the next whole cent whenever the 3rd decimal place is 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
12Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §1819 is enacted to read:

16or tourist or trailer camp that is sold at retail in this State and that is subject to tax at the 
17rate of 9% under section 1811.
182.  Distribution of revenue.  By the 20th day of each month, the assessor shall 
19identify and certify the amount of revenue attributable to each municipality and the 
20unorganized territory under this section for the previous month and subtract the costs of 
21administering this section.  The Treasurer of State shall make monthly payments to 
22municipal treasurers of the net amounts certified by the assessor under this subsection for 
23each municipality and to the Unorganized Territory Education and Services Fund for the 
24net amount attributable to the unorganized territory.
25For purposes of this subsection, "costs of administering this section" means the lesser of 
26the actual cost to the assessor of administering this section and 2% of the total revenue 
27generated under this section.
283.  Effect on revenue sharing and other state aid programs.  Revenue received by 
29the State pursuant to subsection 1 may not be considered to be receipts from the taxes 
30imposed under this Part for the purpose of transfers to the Local Government Fund under 
31Title 30-A, section 5681.  Revenue received pursuant to subsection 1 may not be used to 
32reduce or eliminate any funding otherwise due a county or municipality under any 
33provision of law providing aid to the county or municipality, including, but not limited to, 
34aid for schools, roads, public assistance or jails.

5person so storing, using or otherwise consuming is liable for the tax until the person has 
6paid the tax or has taken a receipt from the seller, as duly authorized by the assessor, 
7showing that the seller has collected the sales or use tax, in which case the seller is liable 
8for it.  Retailers registered under section 1754-B or 1756 shall collect the tax and make 
9remittance to the assessor.  The amount of the tax payable by the purchaser is that 
10provided in the case of sales taxes by section 1812.  When tangible personal property 
11purchased for resale is withdrawn from inventory by the retailer for the retailer's own use, 
12use tax liability accrues at the date of withdrawal.
