6SUMMARY
7This bill implements the recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory 
8Committee concerning public records exceptions as included in Appendix C of the 
9Fourteenth Annual Report of the Right To Know Advisory Committee.
10Part A implements statutory changes initially recommended by the Right To Know 
11Advisory Committee in 2019 pursuant to its responsibility to review existing public 
12records exceptions and included in L.D. 1511, "An Act To Implement the 
13Recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee Concerning Public 
14Records Exceptions."
15Part A eliminates specific protection under the Freedom of Access Act for social 
16security numbers in the context of constituent communications because social security 
17numbers are designated as not public records for all contexts.
18Current law provides that personally identifying information concerning minors that 
19is obtained or maintained by a municipality in providing recreational or nonmandatory 
20educational programs or services is not a public record as long as the municipality has 
21adopted an ordinance that protects the information from disclosure. Part A removes the 
22requirement that a municipality adopt such an ordinance in order to protect the 
23information concerning minors.
24Current law provides a public records exception for records or information describing 
25the architecture, design, access authentication, encryption or security of information 
26technology infrastructure, systems and software. Part A amends the provision to 
27specifically include records or information maintained to ensure government operations 
28and technology continuity and to facilitate disaster recovery.
29Part A amends the statutes governing the confidentiality of the working papers of the 
30Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability to clarify that the working 
31papers, whether in the possession of the office or an entity with which the office director 
32has contracted, remain confidential even after the report is released to the public. It 
33removes duplicative language that is already captured in the definition of working papers.
34Part A amends the Maine Human Rights Act to update and clarify the language 
35describing medical history and information about disabilities, as well as to update a 
36reference to employee health and wellness programs.
37Part B implements recommendations identified by the Right To Know Advisory 
38Committee in 2019.
Page 7 - 129LR3192(01)-11Four sections of Part B amend specific exceptions to the definition of public records 
2in the Freedom of Access Act.
31.  Part B amends the existing public records exceptions to clarify that records, 
4working papers and interoffice and intraoffice memoranda used by or prepared for faculty 
5and administrative committees of the Maine Maritime Academy, the Maine Community 
6College System and the University of Maine System are confidential when the subject 
7matter is confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure by statute, other law, legal 
8precedent or privilege recognized by the courts of this State.
92.  Part B amends the public records exceptions to clarify that working papers 
10become public records once distributed in a public meeting of an advisory organization 
11and not when distributed by an individual member of an advisory organization.
123.  Part B amends the public records exceptions to provide that personal contact 
13information concerning public employees protected as confidential includes a person’s 
14username, password and uniform resource locator for a personal social media account.
154.  Part B amends the public records exceptions to make records related to a 
16discharge of hazardous materials transported by a railroad company that poses a threat to 
17public health, safety and welfare subject to public disclosure after that discharge.
18Part B amends the public records exceptions under the laws governing the Office of 
19the State Auditor to permit the State Auditor to share confidential information related to a 
20complaint alleging fraud, waste, inefficiency or abuse with a department or agency that is 
21the subject of a complaint to ensure that the department or agency can respond 
22appropriately to the complaint. The department or agency is required to maintain the 
23confidentiality of any information related to a complaint furnished by the State Auditor.
24Part B amends the public records exceptions in the laws governing the Maine Dairy 
25Promotion Board and the Maine Dairy and Nutrition Council to remove references to a 
26particular segment or segments of the milk industry.
27Part B directs the Office of Policy and Legal Analysis, in consultation with the Office 
28of the Revisor of Statutes and the Right To Know Advisory Committee, to examine 
29inconsistencies in statutory language related to the designation of information and records 
30as confidential or not subject to public disclosure and to recommend standardized 
31language for use in drafting statutes to clearly delineate what information is confidential 
32and the circumstances under which that information may appropriately be released.  The 
33Office of Policy and Legal Analysis is required to submit a report with its 
34recommendations to the Right To Know Advisory Committee on or before September 1, 
352021.
