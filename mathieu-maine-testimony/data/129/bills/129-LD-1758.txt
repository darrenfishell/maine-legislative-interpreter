16F.  Establish a nursing facility's base year every 2 years and increase the rate of 
17reimbursement beginning July 1, 2014 and every year thereafter until June 30, 2018.  
18For the state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, the base year for each facility is its 
19fiscal year that ended in the calendar year 2016.  For state fiscal years beginning on 
20or after July 1, 2019, subsequent rebasing must be based on the most recent cost 
21report filings available as of April 30th of that respective year.  The department may 
22provide a mechanism for subsequent adjustments to base year costs to reflect any 
23material difference between as-filed cost reports used in rebasing and subsequent 
24determinations of audited, allowable costs for the same fiscal period.  The 
25department's rules must provide that, beginning in the state fiscal year beginning July 
261, 2018, the rates set for each rebasing year must include an inflation adjustment for a 
27cost-of-living percentage change in nursing facility reimbursement each year in 
28accordance with the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics 
29Consumer Price Index medical care services index. and, beginning in the state fiscal 
30year beginning July 1, 2019, the inflation adjustment must be further modified by:
31(1)  An adjustment of the projected inflation from the beginning to the end of the 
32payment year based upon the costs paid by nursing facilities for goods and 
33services required to provide patient care;
34(2)  An adjustment using the forecasted increase in the skilled nursing facility 
35market basket index for the coming federal fiscal year, as published in the 
36Federal Register, when the United States Department of Health and Human 
37Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes the Medicare 
38program's skilled nursing facility prospective payment system rates for the 
39coming federal fiscal year; and
40(3)  When carrying out cost report audits and determining final prospective 
41payment system rates pursuant to department rules regarding costs related to 
Page 2 - 129LR1523(01)-11resident care under the principles of reimbursement for nursing facilities, an 
2adjustment to reflect the actual inflation and take into account any further 
3changes to the medical care services index or market basket index projections 
4over the payment year.
5Any rebasing done pursuant to this paragraph may not result in a nursing facility 
6receiving a reimbursement rate that is lower than the rate in effect on June 30, 2018, 
7inclusive of casemix adjustment.
