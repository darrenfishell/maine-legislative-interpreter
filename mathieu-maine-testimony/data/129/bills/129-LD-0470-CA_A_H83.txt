2) One-half schools will obtain age-appropriate curriculum for 3 grade levels between grade 4 and grade 8 that meets 
the requirements of this legislation at no cost and will devote one hour acclimating themselves to the cun'iculum. The 
remaining schools will have a presenter come into the school to present the traffic and safety education program at no 
cost to the school. 
3) Traffic safety education will be taught at the same grade level each school year using the same curriculum and 
lesson plan developed in the initial year. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to coordinate the distribution of the funds received for this program 
to school administrative units can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
