Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $3,750 in fiscal year 2019-20. An estimated $6, 120 is 
available in each of fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 in the Legislature's proposed budget for legislative studies as 
well as any balances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will 
depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. The additional costs of 
providing staffing assistance to the study during the interim can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted staff 
resources. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the departments whose commissioners or their designess are required to serve on the 
Background Check Consolidation Commission are assumed to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
