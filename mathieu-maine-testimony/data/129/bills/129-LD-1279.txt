6relies on one or more of the following:
7(a)  Fuel cells;
8(b)  Tidal power;
9(c)  Solar arrays and installations;
10(d)  Geothermal installations;

27subsection 3-B.
28A.  Except as provided in paragraph B, beginning January 1, 2008, as a condition of 
29licensing pursuant to section 3203, each competitive electricity provider in this State

11(1)  If by March 31st of the years 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 the commission 
12determines that investment in new renewable capacity resources in the preceding

14meet the portfolio requirements under paragraph A and that the resulting use of 
15renewable energy credits pursuant to subsection 8 or the alternative compliance 
16payment mechanism pursuant to subsection 9, or both of these methods, has 
17burdened electricity customers in the State without providing the benefits of new 
18renewable capacity resources, the commission may suspend all or some of the 
19future scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements under paragraph A.
20(2)  If the commission finds that alternative compliance payments are made

29SUMMARY
30This bill changes the requirements for a hydroelectric generator that meets all state 
31and federal fish passage requirements to qualify as a renewable capacity resource for the 
32purpose of meeting the State's new renewable capacity resource portfolio requirements as 
33follows: it removes the 100-megawatt maximum capacity limit; it adds a 25-megawatt 
34minimum capacity requirement; and it requires the hydroelectric generator to be located 
35in the service territory of a transmission and distribution utility in this State. The bill also 
Page 4 - 129LR1470(01)-11limits competitive electricity providers in the use of output from qualifying hydroelectric 
2generators to meet the new renewable capacity resource portfolio requirements over a 15-
3year period, beginning with a limit of 25% of output from January 1, 2020 through 
4December 31, 2020 and increasing by 5% each year to reach 100% as of January 1, 2035.  
5The legislation has an effective date of January 1, 2020.
