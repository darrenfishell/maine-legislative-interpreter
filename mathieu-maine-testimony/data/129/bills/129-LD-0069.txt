5entitled to benefits for up to 8 workweeks of family medical leave per year.  The

8A.  Unless prevented by a medical emergency from giving notice, an employee shall 
9provide at least 30 days' notice to the employee's employer and a self-employed 
10person shall provide at least 30 days' notice to the bureau of the intended dates upon 
11which family medical leave will commence and terminate; and
12B.  An employee or self-employed person shall obtain certification from a physician

14requested by the employee or self-employed person, except that an employee or

16means, in accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church or religious 
17denomination, may submit certification from an accredited practitioner of those 
18healing methods.
192.  Contribution.  An employee entitled to benefits under chapter 13 shall pay a 
20contribution to the fund in an amount equal to a percentage of the employee's wages in 
21accordance with the rate of contribution determined by the bureau in subsection 3.  The 
22employer of the employee shall deduct the amount of the contribution from the 
23employee's wages.  Contributions under this subsection become due and must be paid by 
24each employer to the bureau for the fund on or before the last day of the month following 
25the close of the calendar quarter to which the contributions relate. In the calculation of 
26any contribution, a fractional part of a cent must be disregarded unless it amounts to 1/2¢ 
27or more, in which case it must be increased to one cent.  A person who is self-employed 
28may receive benefits from the fund upon application to the bureau and payment to the 
29bureau of a contribution in the amount determined by the bureau under subsection 3.
303.  Rate of contribution.  The bureau shall calculate annually the rate of contribution 
31pursuant to subsection 2 of an employee or self-employed person entitled to family 
32medical leave.  The rate of contribution may not exceed 0.5% of an employee's gross 
33wages or a self-employed person's gross earnings.  The bureau may employ a 3rd-party 
34actuary or other qualified person to determine the rate of contribution necessary to 
35properly administer the fund.
364.  Notice.  When an employee has notified an employer pursuant to subsection 1 of a 
37circumstance allowing family medical leave, the employer shall report the notice to the 
38bureau within the 7-day period immediately following the employer's receipt of the 
39notice. Certification required under subsection 1, paragraph B must accompany the 
40employer's report under this subsection or the self-employed person's notice under 
41subsection 1. An employer or self-employed person shall also report the average weekly 
42wages or earnings of the employee or self-employed person, pursuant to the calculation 
43for an injured employee under Title 39-A, section 102, subsection 4, together with any 
Page 3 - 129LR0092(01)-11other information required by the bureau. The statement must report the wages or 
2earnings of the employee or self-employed person on a weekly basis, unless the employee 
3or self-employed person is paid on other than a weekly basis, in which case the employer 
4or self-employed person may report the wages or earnings on the same basis as wages or 
5earnings are paid. A copy of the wage information must be mailed to the employee. If the 
6bureau determines that a notice does not provide a circumstance allowing family medical 
7leave under or is otherwise in violation of this subchapter, the bureau may not pay a 
8benefit under subsection 5 and shall notify the employer and employee or self-employed 
9person as soon as possible after the determination is made.
105.  Benefits.  The bureau shall pay from the fund a family medical leave benefit to an 
11employee or self-employed person who pays a contribution under subsection 2 within a 
12reasonable time after the bureau's receiving notice for that employee or from that self-
13employed person under subsection 4. A benefit under this subsection must be 66% of the 
14weekly wages or earnings of the employee or self-employed person, except that the 
15benefit may not exceed the maximum benefit allowed under chapter 13.  If an employer 
16provides a family medical leave benefit to an employee entitled to a benefit under this 
17subchapter, the employee shall receive the greater of the employer-provided benefit and 
18the benefit under this subsection.  If an employer provides a family medical leave benefit 
19to an employee entitled to a benefit under this subchapter that is greater than the benefit 
20calculated under this subsection, the bureau shall pay to the employer the benefit to which 
21the employee is entitled as calculated under this subsection.
226.  Leave taken intermittently or on reduced leave schedule.  Intermittent or 
23reduced leave schedule family medical leave may be taken subject to the following 
24limitations.
25A.   Leave for a reason described in section 843, subsection 4, paragraph B or C may 
26not be taken by an employee intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the 
27employee and the employer agree otherwise. Subject to subsection 1, paragraphs A 
28and B, leave for a reason described in section 843, subsection 4, paragraph A, D or E 
29may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically 
30necessary. The taking of leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule pursuant 
31to this paragraph may not result in a reduction in the total amount of leave to which 
32the employee is entitled under subsection 1 beyond the amount of leave actually 
33taken.
34B.  If an employee requests intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, 
35for a reason described in section 843, subsection 4, paragraph A, D or E that is 
36foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employer may require the

41position of the employee.

14SUMMARY
15This bill creates a paid family medical leave program, patterned after the unpaid 
16family medical leave program existing in current law but requiring a contribution from an 
17eligible employee, or a self-employed person on a voluntary basis, of no more than 0.5% 
18of the employee's or self-employed person's wages or earnings.  The program requires 
19employers to deduct the contributions from employee paychecks and requires the 
20employers and self-employed persons to submit contributions to the Department of 
21Labor, Bureau of Unemployment Compensation, which is charged with administering the 
22program.  The program pays benefits of up to 66% of an employee's wages or self-
23employed person's earnings, capped at the same maximum amount as unemployment 
24benefits for leave taken by the employee or self-employed person for various family-
25related medical issues.  The bill makes participation optional for employers that employ 
26fewer than 15 employees.  The bill also directs the Department of Labor to develop an 
27implementation plan dealing with staffing, technology, start-up expenses, rulemaking and 
28scheduling to begin the program on its effective date of October 1, 2020.
