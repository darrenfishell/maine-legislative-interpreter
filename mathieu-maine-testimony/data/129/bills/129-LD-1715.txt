35SUMMARY
36Beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 for early adopters and over a 5-year implementation 
37phase-in beginning in fiscal year 2020-21 for other school administrative units, this bill 
38moves responsibility for providing special education and related services for children 
39who are at least 3 years of age and under 6 years of age from the Department of 
40Education, Child Development Services System, the state intermediate educational unit, 
41to the school administrative units of residence of the children.
Page 16 - 129LR1977(01)-11This bill eliminates the Child Development Services System and moves the entire 
2responsibility for providing services to children from birth to under 3 years of age to the 
3Department of Education's office of special services. The funding plan continues the 
4present arrangement of full responsibility for costs being shared among state funds, 
5federal funds, the MaineCare program and private insurers.
6The changes provide fewer transition points, create efficiencies, eliminate duplicate 
7state functions and maximize existing services and facilities at the local level.  The State 
8continues its current practice of funding all services for preschool children with 
9disabilities that are not paid for with federal funds, MaineCare funds or private funds.
