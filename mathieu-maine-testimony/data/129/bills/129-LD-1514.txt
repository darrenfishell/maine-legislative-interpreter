14SUMMARY
15This bill clarifies the laws governing the use of the elver transaction card system and 
16the seizure of illegal elvers.  It makes it explicit that any currency used in violation of a 
17marine resources law may be taken through the libel process.  It requires license 
18revocation for an individual who sells or purchases elvers without using the transaction 
19card system.  Finally, it establishes that if the Department of Marine Resources requires 
20inspection of elver shipments prior to export, the department may charge a fee of up to 
21$500 per inspection.
