14 SUMMARY 
15 This amendment replaces the bill and does the following. 
16 In Part A, the amendment requires health insurance carriers to allow physician 
17 assistants to serve as primary care providers under managed care plans. It also specifies 
18 that carriers are required to provide coverage for services provided by physician assistants 
19 if those services are within a physician assistant's scope of practice and are covered 
20 services under a health plan and makes that provision applicable to contracts issued or 
21 renewed on or after January 1, 2021. 
22 In Part B, the amendment makes the following changes to the laws governing the 
23 licensing and scope of practice of physician assistants. 
24 1. It increases the membership of the Board of Osteopathic Licensure and the Board 
25 of Licensure in Medicine from 10 to 11 members by changing the number of members on 
26 each board who are physician assistants from one member to 2 members. 
27 2. It establishes provisions for the scope of practice of physician assistants based on 
28 practice setting. 
29 3. It removes registration and physician supervisory requirements and establishes 
30 requirements for physician assistants to have collaborative agreements and practice 
31 agreements with physicians and other health care professionals. 
32 4. It clarifies that physician assistants are legally responsible for any medical 
33 services provided in accordance with collaborative and practice agreements and 
34 authorizes the licensing boards to adopt rules related to requirements for collaborative 
35 and practice agreements.

The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services of $26,139 
in fiscal year 2019-20 for technology changes required to allow physician assistants to be reimbursed directly for 
services. A one-time Federal Expenditures Fund allocation is also included for the FMAP match. 
The impact of the change in certain application and registration fees is a net reduction in dedicated revenue of 
$35,000 annually to the Board of Licensure in Medicine and $16,000 annually to the Board of Osteopathic Li censure, 
both affiliated boards of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation.
