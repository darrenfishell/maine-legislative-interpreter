Fiscal Note 
Undetennined cmTent biennium cost increase -General Fm1d 
Changing the age at which children are required to begin attending school from 7 years of age to 6 years of age may 
result in increased costs to local school administrative m1its (SAU's) beginning in the 2019-2020 school year due to 
the potential for an increase in enrollment. The impact to individual local SAU's can not be determined and will 
depend on the number of 6 year-olds that enroll in school as a result of this legislation versus the number that would 
have enrolled absent this bill. School administrative units will begin receiving state subsidy for these students in the 
year following their enrollment in school based on the state contribution percentage for that year. If the total state 
funding is not increased to cover the additional cost, existing subsidy will be redistributed, with some SAU's receiving 
more funding than they would have received if this requirement had not been in place and some SAU's receiving less. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with the rulemaking pro9ess can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
