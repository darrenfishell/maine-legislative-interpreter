31Sec. A-6.  36 MRSA §1112, 3rd ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 618, §8, is further

36assessed upon the withdrawal of farmland or open space land from taxation under this 
37subchapter if the owner applies for the land to be classified as and the land is accepted for 
38classification as timberland under subchapter 2-A.  There also is no penalty imposed 
39when land classified as timberland is accepted for classification as open space land.  A 
40penalty may not be assessed upon withdrawal of open space land from taxation under this 
41subchapter if the owner applies for the land to be classified as and the land is accepted for 
42classification as farmland under this subchapter.  A penalty may not be assessed upon

Page 4 - 129LR2371(01)-11for the land to be classified as and the land is accepted for classification as farmland 
2under this chapter.  The recapture penalty for withdrawal from farmland classification 
3within 10 years of a transfer from either open space tax classification or timberland tax 
4classification is the same imposed on withdrawal from the prior tax classification, open 
5space or tree growth.  The recapture penalty for withdrawal from farmland classification 
6more than 10 years after such a transfer will be the regular farmland recapture penalty 
7provided for in this section.  In the event a penalty is later assessed under subchapter 2-A, 
8the period of time that the land was taxed as farmland or as open space land under this 
9subchapter must be included for purposes of establishing the amount of the penalty.  The 
10recapture penalty for withdrawal from open space classification within 10 years of a
