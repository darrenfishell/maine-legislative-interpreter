40and affected by §9, is further amended to read:
Page 3 - 129LR1671(01)-1111.  Parties to mediation.  A mediator shall include in the mediation process under 
2this section any person the mediator determines is necessary for effective mediation. 
3Mediation and appearance in person is mandatory for:
4A.  The mortgagee, who has the authority to agree to a proposed settlement, loan 
5modification or dismissal of the action, except that the mortgagee may participate by 
6telephone or electronic means as long as that mortgagee is represented with authority 
7to agree to a proposed settlement;
8B.  The defendant;
9C.  Counsel for the plaintiff; and
10D.  Counsel for the defendant, if represented.
11A mortgage servicer as defined in section 6113, subsection 1, paragraph B participating 
12in the mediation process submits to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to the power 
13of the court to sanction parties who fail to participate in the mediation process in good 
14faith as required by section 6113, subsection 2.
15Sec. 3.  14 MRSA §6321-A, sub-§12, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 402, §18, is

20the court may impose appropriate sanctions.  A mortgage servicer as defined in section 
216113, subsection 1, paragraph B participating in the mediation process shall participate in 
22good faith as required by section 6113, subsection 2.  In determining the nature and 
23extent of appropriate sanctions, the court shall consider the need for deterrence of similar 
24future conduct by the entity being sanctioned and by others and may take into account 
25prior orders imposing sanctions upon the sanctioned party, whether in the same case or in 
26other previous cases.  The imposition of any sanction does not bar any independent action 
27by a defendant to seek recovery with respect to the actions giving rise to the order of 
28sanctions.
29Sec. 4.  14 MRSA §6321-A, sub-§13, as amended by PL 2013, c. 521, Pt. F, §2, 
30is further amended to read:
3113.  Report.  A mediator must complete a report for each mediation conducted under 
32this section.  The mediator's report must indicate in a manner as determined by the court 
33that the parties completed in full the Net Present Value Worksheet in the Federal Deposit 
34Insurance Corporation Loan Modification Program Guide or other reasonable 
35determination of net present value.  If the mediation did not result in the settlement or 
36dismissal of the action, the report must include the outcomes of the Net Present Value 
37Worksheet or other determination of net present value.  As part of the report, the mediator 
38may notify the court if, in the mediator's opinion, either party failed to negotiate in good 
39faith.  The mediator's report must also include a statement of all agreements reached at 
40mediation, with sufficient specificity to put all parties on notice of their obligations under 
41agreements reached at mediation, including but not limited to a description of all 
42documents that must be completed and provided pursuant to the agreements reached at 
Page 4 - 129LR1671(01)-11mediation and the time frame during which all actions are required to be taken by the 
2parties, including decisions and determinations of eligibility for all loss mitigation 
3options.  The mediator's report must identify the name of any mortgage servicer as 
4defined in section 6113, subsection 1, paragraph B that participates in the mediation 
5process, and any order of sanctions must likewise identify the name of the mortgage 
6servicer.
7SUMMARY
8This bill requires servicers of residential mortgage loans to act in good faith when 
9dealing with homeowners who are the borrowers under those loans.  The bill changes the 
10foreclosure mediation program to allow the courts to directly sanction a mortgage 
11servicer when the servicer's conduct evidences a failure to mediate in good faith.  The bill 
12requires an order of sanctions to identify the name of the mortgage servicer so that, when 
13a servicer is found to have failed to act in good faith, the court may take into account 
14previous misconduct in fashioning a sanction sufficient to deter continuation of the 
15misconduct in the same case or in future cases.
