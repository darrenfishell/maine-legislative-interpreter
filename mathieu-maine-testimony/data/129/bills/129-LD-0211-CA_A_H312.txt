13 SUMMARY 
14 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, retains the 
15 provisions of the bill that allow an unenrolled voter to vote in a single party's primary 
16 election without having to enroll in a political party. 
17 Under current law, a voter who changes enrollment from one political party to 
18 another political party may not vote in any caucus, convention or primary election for 15 
19 days after changing enrollment, unless the voter changes the voter's voting residence at 
20 the same time that the voter changes political party enrollment. . This amendment 
21 similarly prohibits a voter who withdraws from a political party from voting in any 
22 caucus, convention or primary election for 15 days after withdrawing, unless the voter 
23 changes the voter's voting residence at the same time that the voter withdraws from a 
24 political party. 
25 This amendment also requires an election clerk to record on the incoming voting list 
26 which party's primary ballot, if any, is requested by and issued to an unenrolled voter 
27 during a primary election. After the primary election, this information must be entered in 
28 the central voter registration system. 
29 This amendment further provides that the effective date of this legislation is July 1, 
30 2021.
