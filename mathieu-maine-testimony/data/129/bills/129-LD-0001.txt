342.  Substantially similar to federal Affordable Care Act; required categories.

Page 7 - 129LR0846(01)-11for a health plan subject to the federal Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019. The 
2superintendent shall define the essential health benefits required for a health plan, except

19the categories described in subsection 2, so that benefits are not unduly weighted 
20toward any category;
21B.  Ensure that coverage decisions, determination of reimbursement rates, 
22establishment of incentive programs and designation of benefits are done in ways that 
23do not discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability or expected 
24length of life;
25C.  Take into account the health care needs of diverse segments of the population, 
26including women, children, persons with disabilities and other groups;
27D.  Ensure that health benefits established as essential are not subject to denial to 
28individuals against their wishes on the basis of the individuals' age or expected length 
29of life or of the individuals' present or predicted disability, degree of medical 
30dependency or quality of life;
31E.  Provide that a qualified health plan may not be treated as providing coverage for 
32the essential health benefits package described in subsection 1 unless the plan 
33provides that:
34(1)  Coverage for emergency department services will be provided without 
35imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or 
36any limitation on coverage where the provider of services does not have a 
37contractual relationship with the plan for the providing of services that is more 
38restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency 
Page 8 - 129LR0846(01)-11department services received from providers who do have such a contractual 
2relationship with the plan; and
3(2)  If emergency department services are provided out of network, the cost-
4sharing requirement, expressed as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate, is the 
5same requirement that would apply if such services were provided in network;
6F.  Provide that if a plan is offered through an exchange, another health plan offered 
7through that exchange may not fail to be treated as a qualified health plan solely 
8because the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered through the stand-alone 
9plan that are otherwise required under subsection 2, paragraph J;
10G.  Periodically review the essential health benefits package under subsection 1 and 
11provide a report to the Legislature and the public that contains:
12(1)  An assessment of whether enrollees are facing any difficulty accessing 
13needed services for reasons of coverage or cost; 
14(2)  An assessment of whether the essential health benefits package needs to be 
15modified or updated to account for changes in medical evidence or scientific 
16advancement;
17(3)  Information on how the essential health benefits package will be modified to 
18address any gaps in access or changes in the evidence base; and
19(4)  An assessment of the potential of additional or expanded benefits to increase 
20costs and the interactions between the addition or expansion of benefits and 
21reductions in existing benefits to meet actuarial limitations; and
22H.  Periodically update the essential health benefits package under subsection 1 to 
23address any gaps in access to coverage or changes in the evidence base the 
24superintendent identifies in the review conducted under paragraph G.
254.  Cost-sharing limitations.  The superintendent shall establish annual limitations 
26on cost sharing and deductibles that are substantially similar to the limitations for health 
27plans subject to the federal Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019. The 
28superintendent may increase the annual limitation as needed to reflect any premium 
29adjustment percentage. For purposes of this subsection, "premium adjustment percentage" 
30means the percentage, if any, by which the average per capita premium for health 
31insurance coverage in the United States for the preceding calendar year as estimated by 
32the superintendent no later than October 1st of such preceding calendar year exceeds such 
33average per capita premium for 2019.
345.  Levels of coverage.  The superintendent shall define levels of coverage that are 
35substantially similar to the levels of coverage required for health plans subject to the 
36federal Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019.
376.  Report.  Within 30 days of defining essential health benefits as required under 
38this section or within 30 days after adopting any changes to the definition of essential 
39health benefits, the superintendent shall submit a report summarizing the definition of 
40essential health benefits to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
41jurisdiction over health coverage, insurance and financial services matters.
Page 9 - 129LR0846(01)-117.  Rule of construction.  This section may not be construed to prohibit a health plan 
2from providing benefits in excess of the essential health benefits described in this section.
38.  Rules.  Rules adopted pursuant to this section are major substantive rules as 
4defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
5Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
6legislation takes effect when approved.
7SUMMARY
8The purpose of this bill is to ensure that consumer protections related to health 
9insurance coverage included in the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are 
10codified in state law. 
11In Part A, the bill does the following.
121.  It makes clear that individual and group health plans may not impose any 
13preexisting condition exclusion on an enrollee. The bill does permit a carrier to restrict 
14enrollment in individual health plans to open enrollment and special enrollment periods 
15established in rule. 
162.  It clarifies that carriers offering individual or group health plans may not establish 
17lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits. The bill specifies that the 
18provision prohibiting annual limits on the dollar value of benefits applies to the dollar 
19value of essential health benefits as determined by the Superintendent of Insurance.  
203.  It allows children, until they attain 26 years of age, to remain on their parents' 
21health insurance policy.
224.  It changes the maximum rate differential due to age that may be filed by the 
23carrier to the rate differential that is permitted under the federal Patient Protection and 
24Affordable Care Act.
25In Part B, the bill requires that, at a minimum, health plans cover essential health 
26benefits that are substantially similar to those benefits required for health plans subject to 
27the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as of January 1, 2019. The bill 
28directs the Superintendent of Insurance to define essential health benefits in rule and 
29designates those rules as major substantive and subject to legislative review and approval.
