25SUMMARY
26This bill authorizes the Department of Public Safety, Gambling Control Board to 
27accept an application for a casino operator license from a joint tribal entity authorizing 
28the joint tribal entity to operate table games and slot machines at one casino owned by the 
29joint tribal entity.  It increases by 1,500 the number of slot machines that may be 
30registered in the State.  "Joint tribal entity" is defined as a legal entity formed for the 
31purpose of operating slot machines and table games at one casino, the entire ownership of 
32which is held equally, either jointly or in common, by the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
33Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
34Indians.  
35The bill provides the following in regard to the casino.
361.  It specifies that, as a condition of a joint tribal entity's receiving a license, a casino 
37must be located:
38A.  On land that on January 1, 2019 was owned by the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
39Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs or the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
40Indians or land held in trust by the United States or by any other person or entity for 
Page 5 - 129LR2121(01)-11the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs or 
2the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians;
3B.  On land located in the unorganized territory; or 
4C.  On land in a municipality and that municipality approves of the operation of the 
5casino in that municipality, either by vote of its legislative body or in a referendum of 
6the voters of the municipality.
72.  It exempts a casino licensed to a joint tribal entity from the provision in current 
8law that prohibits a new casino or slot machine facility from being located within 100 
9miles of an existing casino or slot machine facility.  It provides that a casino licensed to a 
10joint tribal entity may not be located within 50 miles of an existing facility.
113.  It provides that a change in the composition of a joint tribal entity does not 
12invalidate a casino license issued to the entity as long as the change occurs no sooner than 
136 months after the license is issued and the entity still consists of at least 2 federally 
14recognized Indian tribes in the State who own equal shares of the entity in its entirety.
154.  It changes the provision in current law that states that distributions of net slot 
16machine revenue from the casino located in Oxford County to the Penobscot Nation and 
17the Passamaquoddy Tribe revert to the operator if one or both tribes operate or receive 
18distributions from a newly licensed casino.  It provides that the distribution of that slot 
19machine revenue would instead be deposited into the General Fund if either the 
20Penobscot Nation or the Passamaquoddy Tribe operated or received distributions from a 
21newly licensed casino.
225.  It establishes a distribution rate of 25% of net slot machine income and 16% of net 
23table game income for a casino operator that is a joint tribal entity.  The slot machine 
24income is used to fund education for kindergarten to grade 12 and the table game income 
25is deposited to the General Fund.
