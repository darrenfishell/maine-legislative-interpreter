Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Month/Year Election Type Question 
Nov-19 General Referendum Length 
Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $172,000 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill provides for ranked-choice voting for general elections for presidential electors if approved at a statewide 
referendum election. Ranked-choice voting is currently in place for state primary elections and general elections for 
federal Congressional candidates. Requiring ranked-choice voting for general elections for presidential electors is not 
expected to add significant costs for this expansion.
