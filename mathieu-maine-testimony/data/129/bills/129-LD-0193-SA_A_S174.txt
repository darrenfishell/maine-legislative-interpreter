This amendment removes the emergency preamble from the bill, but keeps the retroactive impact to January 1, 2019. 
As the effective date of the bill will now occur in fiscal year 2019-20, there will be no fiscal impact in fiscal year 2018-
19 and the General Fund revenue reduction and the Local Government Fund revenue increase caused by the bill in 
that year are reversed and moved to fiscal year 2019-20. The amounts in fiscal year 2019-20 are higher because they 
are based on updated revenue estimates from the May 2019 Revenue Forecasting Committee forecast.
