This bill will increase ATV registration fees from $33 to $45 for a resident annual registration, $53 to $75 for a 
nonresident seven-day registration and $68 to $90 for a nonresident one year registration. The bill directs $12 of each 
registration to the ATV Recreational Management Fund within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry and $10 of each nonresident registration to the newly established ATV Enforcement Fund within the 
Department ofinland Fisheries and Wildlife. 
Based on current ATV registrations, it is estimated that the registration fee increase will generate an additional 
$992,996 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue starting in fiscal year 2019-20. This bill includes Other Special 
Revenue Funds allocations of $867,936 to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and of $124,960 
to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife starting in fiscal year 2019-20 to allow for the expenditure of the 
additional revenue.
