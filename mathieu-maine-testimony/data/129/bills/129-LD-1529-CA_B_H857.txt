11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the  
12 following:
13 'Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §594-A is enacted to read:
14§594-A.  Nondisclosure agreements
151.  Employer defined.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, 
16 "employer" means a person in this State that employs individuals and includes the State

18 of an employer directly or indirectly.
192.  Certain preemployment and employment agreements prohibited.  An employer 
20 may not require an employee, intern or applicant for employment to enter into a contract 
21 or agreement that waives or limits any right to report or discuss discrimination, retaliation 
22 or harassment occurring in the workplace or at work-related events.
233.  Certain settlement, separation and severance agreements prohibited. An 
24 employer may not require an employee, intern or applicant for employment to enter into a 
25 settlement, separation or severance agreement that includes a provision that:
26 A.  Limits an individual's right to report, testify or provide evidence to a federal or state 
27 agency that enforces employment or discrimination laws;
28 B.  Prevents an individual from testifying or providing evidence in federal and state

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1 B.  The provision applies to all parties to the agreement to the extent otherwise 
2 permitted by law;
3 C.  The agreement clearly states that the individual retains the right to report, testify or 
4 provide evidence to federal and state agencies that enforce employment or 
5 discrimination laws and to testify and provide evidence in federal and state court 
6 proceedings; and
7 D.  The employer retains a copy of the agreement for 6 years following the execution

16 amount of the total assessed fines, except that for an employer's discharge of or refusal 
17 to hire an individual who declines to enter into a contract or agreement that waives or 
18 limits any right to report or discuss discrimination, retaliation or harassment occurring 
19 in the workplace or at work-related events, the individual may elect:
20 (1)  To receive liquidated damages pursuant to this paragraph; or
21 (2)  Employment or reinstatement with back wages.'
22 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
23 number to read consecutively.
24SUMMARY
25 This amendment replaces the bill. It prohibits an employer from requiring an employee, 
26 intern or applicant for employment to enter into a contract or agreement that waives or 
27 limits any right to report or discuss discrimination, retaliation or harassment occurring in 
28 the workplace or at work-related events.
29 It also prohibits an employer from requiring an employee, intern or applicant for 
30 employment to enter into a settlement, separation or severance agreement that limits an 
31 individual's right to report, testify or provide evidence to a federal or state agency that 
32 enforces employment or discrimination laws, prevents an individual from testifying or 
33 providing evidence in federal and state court proceedings in response to legal process or 
34 prohibits an individual from reporting conduct to a law enforcement agency. This 
35 amendment allows a settlement, separation or severance agreement, under certain 
36 circumstances, to include a provision that prevents the subsequent disclosure of factual 
37 information relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation or harassment.
38 It provides the Department of Labor with the duty to enforce these provisions and 
39 allows an individual to receive liquidated damages or to be employed or reinstated with 
40 back wages when an employer discharges or refuses to hire an individual who declines to 
41 enter into a contract or agreement that waives or limits any right to report or discuss 
42 discrimination, retaliation or harassment occurring in the workplace or at work-related 
43 events.
