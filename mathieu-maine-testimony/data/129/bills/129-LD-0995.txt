20of business on September 30th of the odd-numbered year following its issuance, unless 
21renewed or earlier surrendered, suspended or revoked pursuant to this Article. No later 
22than 15 days after a licensee ceases to engage in the business of student education loan 
23servicing in this State for any reason, including a business decision to terminate 
24operations in this State, license revocation, bankruptcy or voluntary dissolution, the 
25licensee shall provide written notice of surrender to the superintendent and shall surrender

27engage in such business. The written notice of surrender must identify the location where 
28the records of the licensee will be stored and the name, address and telephone number of 
29an individual authorized to provide access to the records. The surrender of a license does 
30not reduce or eliminate the licensee's civil or criminal liability arising from acts or

32actions undertaken by the superintendent to revoke or suspend a license, assess a civil 
33penalty, order restitution or exercise any other authority provided to the superintendent.

35the ensuing 24-month period upon the filing of an application containing all required 
36documents and fees as provided in this section. A renewal application must be filed on or 
37before September 1st of the year in which the license expires. A renewal application filed 
38with the superintendent after September 1st that is accompanied by a $100 late fee is 
39deemed to be timely and sufficient. If an application for a renewal license has been filed 
40with the superintendent on or before the date the license expires, the license sought to be 
41renewed continues in effect until the issuance by the superintendent of the renewal 
42license applied for or until the superintendent has notified the licensee in writing of the 
43superintendent's refusal to issue the renewal license together with the grounds upon which 
Page 6 - 129LR0137(01)-11the refusal is based. The superintendent may refuse to issue a renewal license on any 
2ground on which the superintendent might refuse to issue an initial license.
36.  Dishonored check.  If a check filed with the superintendent to pay a license, 
4investigation or renewal fee under this section is dishonored, the superintendent shall 
5automatically suspend the license or the renewal license that has been issued but is not 
6yet effective. The superintendent shall give the licensee notice of the automatic 
7suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for 
8a hearing on such actions in accordance with Article 6.
97.  Update application information.  An applicant or licensee under this Article 
10shall notify the superintendent, in writing, of any change in the information provided in 
11its initial application for a license or its most recent renewal application for a license, as 
12applicable, not later than 10 business days after the occurrence of the event that results in 
13the change.
148.  Incomplete application.  The superintendent may consider an application for a 
15license under this Article abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for 
16information required under this Article or any rules adopted pursuant to this Article, as 
17long as the superintendent notifies the applicant, in writing, that the application will be 
18considered abandoned if the applicant fails to submit the information within 60 days after 
19the date on which the request for information was made. An application filing fee paid 
20prior to the date an application is abandoned pursuant to this subsection may not be 
21refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection does not preclude 
22the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under this Article.
239.  Change of license notification.  A licensee under this Article may not act within 
24this State as a student loan servicer under any name or at any place of business other than 
25those named in the license. Any change of location of a place of business of a licensee 
26requires prior written notice to the superintendent. Not more than one place of business 
27may be maintained under the same license, but the superintendent may issue more than 
28one license to a licensee that complies with the provisions of this Article as to each 
29license. A license is not transferable or assignable.

31adequate records of each student education loan transaction for not less than 2 years 
32following the final payment on the student education loan or the assignment of the 
33student education loan, whichever occurs first, or except as otherwise required by federal 
34law, a federal student loan education agreement or a contract between the Federal 
35Government and a licensee under this Article.

37available or shall send such records to the superintendent by registered or certified mail, 
38return receipt requested, or by any express delivery carrier that provides a dated delivery 
39receipt, not later than 5 business days after requested by the superintendent to do so. The 
40superintendent may grant a licensee additional time to make such records available or to 
41send the records to the superintendent.
Page 7 - 129LR0137(01)-1111.  License suspension and revocation; refusal to renew.  The superintendent may 
2suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to this section or take any 
3other action in accordance with Article 6 if the superintendent finds one of the following:
4A.  The licensee has violated any provision of this Article or any rule or order 
5lawfully adopted or made pursuant to and within the authority of this Article; or
6B.  Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time of the original 
7application for the license, clearly would have warranted a denial of the license.

9suspended.
