Page 1 - 129LR1794(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3025, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 420, Pt. D, §2 and 
3affected by §6, is further amended to read:
41.  Circumstances of death that must be reported.  A medical examiner case may 
5exist and must be reported as provided in section 3026 when remains are found that may 
6be human and raise suspicion that death has occurred under any of the following 
7circumstances: 
8A.  Death is suspected of having been caused by any type of physical injury, 
9including poisoning, regardless of whether the suspected manner of death is 
10homicide, suicide or accident.  This circumstance must be reported irrespective of 
11whether the deceased had been attended by a physician, was a patient in a hospital, 
12survived for a considerable time following the physical injury or died from terminal 
13natural causes consequent to and following the physical injury;
14B.  Suddenly when the person is in apparent good health and has no specific natural 
15disease sufficient to explain death;
16C.  During diagnostic or therapeutic procedures under circumstances indicating gross 
17negligence or when clearly due to trauma or poisoning unrelated to the ordinary risks 
18of those procedures;
19D.  Death when the person is in custody pursuant to an arrest, confined in a state 
20correctional or detention facility, county jail, other county correctional or detention 
21facility or local lockup or is on the way to or from a courthouse or any of these places 
22while in the custody of a law enforcement officer or county or state corrections 
23official;
24E.  Death while the person is a patient or resident of a facility of the Department of 
25Health and Human Services or residential care facility maintained or licensed by the 
26Department of Health and Human Services, unless clearly certifiable by an attending 
27physician as due to specific natural causes;
28F.  Death suspected of being due to a threat to the public health when the authority of 
29the medical examiner is needed to adequately study the case for the protection of the 
30public health;
31G.  Death suspected of not having been certified, including, but not limited to, bodies 
32brought into the State and any buried remains uncovered other than by legal 
33exhumation;
34H.  Deaths suspected of being medical examiner cases which may have been 
35improperly certified or inadequately examined, including, but not limited to, bodies 
36brought into the State under those circumstances;
37I.  Sudden infant death syndrome deaths and all other deaths of children under the age 
38of 18 unless clearly certifiable by an attending physician as due to specific natural 
39causes unrelated to abuse or neglect;
40J.  Whenever human or possibly human remains are discovered not properly interred 
41or disposed of, for which the responsibility to do so cannot be readily determined; or
Page 2 - 129LR1794(01)-11K.  Any cause when there is no attending physician capable of certifying the death as 
2due to natural causes. When a person dies who is under the care of a religious 
3practitioner who uses prayer and spiritual means of healing, the fact that the deceased 
4has been under such religious care does not warrant suspicion of foul play or 
5investigation beyond that warranted by the other facts of the case.
6In the absence of any of the circumstances outlined in this subsection, the fact that a 
7patient dies within 24 hours of admission to a hospital or other health care facility need 
8not be reported to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner.
9In any case in which the necessity of a report is questionable, a report must be made.
10Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3025, sub-§1-A, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 433, §4, is 
11amended to read:
12A.  Deaths due to the consequences of long-term alcohol use, long-term exposure to 
13environmental or occupational toxins or long-term exposure to carcinogens;
14Sec. 3.  32 MRSA §1405, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. GGG, §1, is 
15further amended to read:
16The body of a deceased person may not be cremated within 48 hours after death 
17unless the person died of a contagious or infectious disease, and in no event may the body 
18of a deceased person be cremated, buried at sea, used by medical science or removed 
19from the State until the person, firm or corporation in charge of the disposition has 
20received a certificate from a duly appointed medical examiner or medicolegal death 
21investigator appointed pursuant to Title 22, section 3023-A that the medical examiner or 
22medicolegal death investigator has made personal inquiry into the cause and manner of 
23death and is satisfied that further examination or judicial inquiry concerning the cause 
24and manner of death is not necessary.  This certificate, a certified copy of the death 
25certificate and a burial transit permit when presented by the authorized person as defined 
26in Title 22, section 2846 is sufficient authority for cremation, burial at sea, use by medical 
27science or removal from the State, and the person, firm or corporation in charge of the 
28disposition may not refuse to cremate or otherwise dispose of the body solely because 
29these documents are presented by such an authorized person.  The certificate must be 
30retained by the person, firm or corporation in charge of the cremation or disposition for a 
31period of 15 years. For the certificate, the medical examiner must receive a fee of $25 
32payable by the person requesting the certificate.  This fee may be waived at the discretion 
33of the Chief Medical Examiner.
