Page 1 - 129LR1646(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, opioid use disorder has reached epidemic proportions and threatens the 
4lives and well-being of many Maine residents; and
5Whereas, existing modalities and strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder are 
6insufficient to end the epidemic of this disorder in Maine; and
7Whereas, existing services are especially inadequate to address the impact of opioid 
8use disorder on those experiencing or having experienced unstable housing, minimal or 
9no employment, unreliable transportation, lack of insurance coverage, use of multiple 
10substances, frequent hospitalization or prior overdoses; and
11Whereas, failure to provide timely treatment to those most at risk of overdose death 
12from opioid use leads to unnecessary loss of life and tragic dislocations of family life, 
13while imposing substantial additional costs on the State due to related increases in 
14incarcerations, hospital admissions and foster care for children affected by parental use of 
15opioids; and
16Whereas, a low barrier, rapid access treatment system delivered and coordinated by 
17Maine's community health centers will provide an essential component of an improved 
18array of responses to this epidemic; and
19Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
20the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
21immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
22therefore,
23Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

15§2354.  Low Barrier Opioid Treatment Response Program
161.  Program establishment.  The Low Barrier Opioid Treatment Response Program, 
17referred to in this section as "the program," is established in the department to provide 
18resources for federally qualified health centers, referred to in this section as "community 
19health centers," to develop and deploy low barrier, rapid access treatment models to treat 
20opioid use disorder.  The program must provide low barrier, rapid access to treatment for 
21those persons typically unable to obtain timely treatment and at greatest risk of opioid 
22overdose, including but not limited to persons affected by unstable housing, minimal or 
23no employment, unreliable transportation, use of multiple substances associated with 
24addiction or chronic overuse, frequent hospitalization, prior overdoses or a lack of health 
25insurance coverage for substance use treatment services.
262.  Program components.  The program must include:
27A.  Support for clinic infrastructure to reduce barriers to access to treatment, 
28including incentives for community health centers to support additional qualified 
29providers in obtaining waivers to provide medication-assisted therapy services and 
30support for each community health center to identify and compensate an individual 
31within that community health center to help implement the program;
32B.  Support for community health centers to incentivize providers to accept increased 
33call responsibilities and to see greater numbers of patients with opioid use disorders;
34C.  A statewide program of anti-stigma training that includes providers, staff and 
35community health center patient-led boards;
36D.  Support for the development and implementation of a standardized induction 
37practice across all participating community health centers;
38E.  Increasing the availability of naloxone hydrochloride to community health centers 
39and training community health center personnel on the emergency administration of 
40naloxone hydrochloride; and
Page 3 - 129LR1646(01)-11F.  Strategies to increase the number of providers willing to issue prescriptions for 
2medication-assisted therapy services in a manner that facilitates rapid access to 
3treatment.
43.  Implementation; pilot.  The department shall initially implement the program as 
5a pilot project and shall subsequently expand the program to all community health centers 
6in accordance with this subsection.
7A.  The pilot project must be operated by at least 3 community health centers selected 
8on the basis of applications demonstrating interest in implementing the program and 
9capacity to implement the program.  The department shall strive to approve 
10applications of community health centers of varying sizes and as geographically 
11diverse as practicable given the pool of applicants.  The department may phase in 
12selected elements of the program over the course of the pilot project.  Community 
13health centers participating in the pilot project shall collect information on and report 
14to the department the number of patients served in the program and, for each patient 
15served:
16(1)  Emergency department utilization and hospital admissions;
17(2)  Time elapsed between first patient encounter and delivery of services in the 
18program; and
19(3)  Any other outcome and quality indicators that the department may specify 
20after consultation with participating health centers, without duplicating other 
21existing reporting requirements.
22B.  After review of the data reported during the pilot project, the department shall 
23expand the program to include all community health centers, on a schedule and with 
24such financial support as the department determines to be appropriate and sufficient 
25to address the statewide need for the program.
264.  Reimbursement.  The department shall modify and supplement the 
27reimbursement of community health centers provided under section 3174-V to the extent 
28necessary to implement this section.
295.  Rules.  The department shall adopt routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, 
30chapter 375, subchapter 2-A to implement the provisions of this section.
31Sec. 5.  Review of barriers.  In conjunction with review of the reports provided 
32pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 2354, subsection 3, paragraph A, 
33the Department of Health and Human Services and representatives of federally qualified 
34health centers shall examine the extent to which existing structures for reimbursement 
35and delivery of services by federally qualified health centers and other providers may 
36hamper or facilitate access to opioid use disorder treatment and develop proposed 
37changes to address identified barriers, reduce unnecessary costs and enhance coordination 
38between other providers and federally qualified health centers in serving persons at risk 
39of opioid overdose.  The department, with input from providers, shall present a report 
40with the findings under this section to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
41Human Services no later than January 15, 2020.  The report must address the 
42effectiveness of the implementation of the pilot project established pursuant to Title 22, 
Page 4 - 129LR1646(01)-11section 2354, subsection 3, the schedule for full implementation and the extent of any 
2additional funding needed to accomplish full implementation.

20SUMMARY
21This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the Low 
22Barrier Opioid Treatment Response Program in Maine's federally qualified health centers

24and sustainability of acute care responses to persons in urgent need of treatment for 
25substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder.  The department is required to 
26implement the program on a pilot basis initially and expand the program statewide after 
27reviewing initial outcomes of the pilot.
28It also directs the department and representatives of federally qualified health centers 
29to examine the extent to which existing structures for reimbursement and delivery of 
30services by federally qualified health centers and other providers may hamper or facilitate 
31access to opioid use disorder treatment and develop proposed changes to address 
32identified barriers, reduce unnecessary costs and enhance coordination between federally 
33qualified health centers and other providers serving persons at risk of opioid overdose.  
34The department is required to report findings on these subjects and on initial pilot 
35implementation of the Low Barrier Opioid Treatment Response Program to the Joint
