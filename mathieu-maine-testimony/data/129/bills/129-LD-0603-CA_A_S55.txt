Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires the Department of Enviromnental Protection (DEP) to pay 75% of the costs incurred before 
December 31, 2025 of closing municipal landfills that meet certain criteria. This bill extends eligibility to municipal 
landfills with applications to the DEP that were accepted for processing on or before September 1, 1989 and that 
were approved within one year of the acceptance date. The DEP has indicated that there is one active landfill in Old 
Town that meets the new eligibility criteria and that it would cost $263,000 to reimburse Old Town for 75% of the 
closme costs. The DEP share will be paid from the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund (MSWMF) within the 
DEP, which derives its revenue from fees on the disposal of construction and demolition debris. Under existing 
statute, the fee will continue to be collected until all existing landfill closme costs subject to DEP reimbursement are 
paid. The addition of another landfill to reimburse will lower annual payments to reimbmse other municipalities for 
landfill closme costs and extend the period of time they will be reimburs~d to keep the annual aggregate distribution 
from the MSWMF unchanged. Therefore, the additional $263,000 will be paid in a future period when the existing 
payments would have ceased but will now continue. The DEP has expressed concern that municipalities may be 
affected by having their payments lowered.
