Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill creates a new can'ier license, effective January 1, 2020, which allows the possession or transport of Atlantic 
herring and Atlantic menhaden which was not caught by the holder of the license. The bill sets a fee of $98 for the 
license and directs that revenue from the license fee be deposited into the Pelagic and Anadromous Fisheries Fund. 
Due to the unique nature of the fishe1y and limited species, the Department of Marine Resources anticipates a minor 
Other Special Revenue Funds increase from the licenses.
