2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §42-B, sub-§1, ¶F, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 219, §2, is 
3amended to read:
4F.  Minimum wage and overtime provisions as described in section sections 664 and 
5664-A.
6Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 272, §1, is further 
7amended to read:
82.  Tip credit.  An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 
9employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 
10established in this section, or, if applicable, section 664-A, except that from January 1, 
112017 to December 31, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid directly to a tipped service 
12employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour.  An employer who elects to use the tip 
13credit must inform the affected employee in advance, as provided for in this subsection, 
14and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the minimum hourly wage 
15when direct wages and the tip credit are combined within the established 7-day 
16workweek.  Upon a satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's 
17representative that the actual tips received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall 
18increase the direct wages by the difference.
19The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 
20not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 
21bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 
22employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 
23employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 
24reimbursement from a credit card company.  The employer may not deduct any amount 
25from employee tips charged to a credit card, including, but not limited to, service fees 
26assessed to the employer in connection with the credit card transaction.
27An employer who elects to use the tip credit must inform the affected employee in 
28advance, either orally or in writing, of the following information:
29A.  The amount of the direct wage to be paid by the employer to the tipped employee;
30B.  The amount of tips to be credited as wages toward the minimum wage;
31C.  That the amount of tips to be credited as wages may not exceed the value of the 
32tips actually received by the employee;
33D.  That all tips received by the affected employee must be retained by the employee, 
34except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and 
35regularly receive tips in accordance with subsection 2-A;
36E.  That the tip credit may not apply to any employee who has not been informed by 
37the employer of the provisions for a tip credit; and
38F.  If the employer uses a tip pooling arrangement, any required tip pool contribution 
39amount from the employee.
