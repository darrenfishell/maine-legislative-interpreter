Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill removes the requirement that a person retreat if it is safe to do so in order to avoid violating the statutes 
related to the use of deadly force. To the extent that over time this change leads to fewer individuals being 
incarcerated, the Department of Corrections will see a reduction in costs. The number of cases affected by this change 
is not expected to be significant.
