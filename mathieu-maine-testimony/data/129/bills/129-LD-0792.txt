2Sec. 1.  2 MRSA §11 is enacted to read:
3§11.  General obligation bonds
4The Governor shall authorize the issuance of a general obligation bond that has been 
5ratified by the legal voters of the State unless:
61.  Debt service greater.  The Treasurer of State determines that the debt service on 
7the bond would be greater than the amount budgeted;
82.  Adverse impact on credit rating.  The Treasurer of State determines that the 
9issuance of the bonds will adversely affect the credit rating of the State;
103.  Advantageous interest rate.  The Treasurer of State determines that a delay in 
11the issuance of the bonds will likely result in a more financially advantageous interest 
12rate;
134.  Project not proceeding.  The Governor receives notification that a project for 
14which the bond was authorized is not going forward and the funding to be provided by 
15the bond is not required; or
165.  Alternative funding available.  The Governor receives notification that 
17alternative funding sources are available to implement, within a comparable time frame, a 
18project and the purposes for which the bond was authorized and ratified.
19Upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances set out in subsections 1 to 5, the 
20Governor shall immediately notify the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
21House of Representatives and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and the 
22House of Representatives of the specific bond delayed or otherwise not issued, the extent 
23of the delay of the issuance of the bond and the effect of the delay or nonissuance on the 
24project and purposes of the bond.
25Sec. 2.  5 MRSA §145, as amended by PL 1991, c. 780, Pt. Y, §15, is further 
26amended to read:

29pieces of not less than $1,000, and of any multiple of 1,000, in exchange for, and in place 
30of, any coupon bonds issued under the laws of this State, bearing the same rate of interest 
31and maturing at the same time as the bonds that the Treasurer of State may receive 
32therefor in exchange. The place of payment prescribed therein must be the State Treasury. 
33Said bonds must bear the facsimile of the signature of the Governor and must be signed 
34by the Treasurer of State or the Treasurer of State's deputy and attested by the 
35Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services, or such agent as the 
36commissioner may designate.
