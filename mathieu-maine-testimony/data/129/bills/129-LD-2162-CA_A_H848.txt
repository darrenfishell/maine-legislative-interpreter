25SUMMARY
26This amendment cross-references the definitions of "gender identity" and "sexual 
27orientation" in the Maine Human Rights Act. Because "sexual orientation" is defined to 
28include gender expression in that Act, the amendment also strikes unnecessary references 
29to gender expression from the bill.
30The amendment further changes, from January 15, 2021 to May 15, 2021, the date by 
31which the Director of the Maine Bureau of Veterans' Services within the Department of 
32Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management must submit a report on the potential for
