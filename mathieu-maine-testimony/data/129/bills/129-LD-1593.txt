Page 1 - 129LR2424(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง15915, sub-ยง1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 
3279, ยง1, is amended to read:
41.  Initial agreement for energy conservation improvements.  A school 
5administrative unit may enter into an agreement of up to 20 years with an energy services 
6company. For the purposes of this section, "energy services company" means a company 
7or 3rd-party financing company that provides design, installation, operation, maintenance 
8and financing of energy conservation or combined individual or combined school 
9administrative unit facility projects, including, but not limited to, energy conservation, 
10facility infrastructure improvements and related air quality improvements at existing or 
11new school administrative unit facilities.  The school administrative unit's costs to enter 
12into such an agreement are not applicable to the unit's school construction project costs, 
13the debt service on which is eligible for subsidy purposes under section 15907.  Such an 
14agreement is deemed to be a professional service, which is not subject to the competitive 
15bidding requirements of Title 5, section 1743-A, if the agreement:
16A.  Provides for operation or maintenance of the improvement for at least 5 years or 
17the entire term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years; and
18B.  Requires a guaranty by the contractor that the improvement will meet financial 
19and performance criteria set forth in the agreement for at least 5 years or for the entire 
20term of the financing agreement if longer than 5 years; and.
21C.  Has a total contract cost, excluding private or federal grant funds, interest and 
22operating and maintenance costs, of less than $2,500,000 for any school building.
23A school administrative unit may select an energy services company on the basis of a 
24request for qualifications or a request for proposals, and it is not required to use a 
25competitive method set forth in this chapter and Title 5, section 1743-A and Private and 
26Special Law 1999, chapter 79.  The selection process must include at a minimum a 
27request for qualifications or a request for proposals that is advertised in a newspaper of 
28general circulation in the school administrative unit and a newspaper of general 
29circulation in the City of Augusta.  The deadline for receipt of requests for qualifications 
30or requests for proposals may not be less than 15 days from the last day the advertisement 
31was published. The school administrative unit shall establish an interview committee, 
32which must include the superintendent of the school administrative unit and at least one 
33school board member.  The interview committee shall interview not fewer than 3 energy 
34services companies unless a smaller number of energy services companies responds to the 
35request for qualifications or request for proposals.  A request for qualifications or a 
36request for proposals may not contain terms that require an energy services company to 
37have more than 3 years of experience in the energy conservation field, a minimum 
38number of prior projects or project references or membership in or accreditation from a 
39regional, national or international association of energy services companies or to use 
40equipment that is not generally available to energy services companies or terms that are 
41otherwise included for the purpose of bias or favoritism toward a particular energy 
42services company.
Page 2 - 129LR2424(01)-11Objections to the terms of a request for qualifications or a request for proposals under this 
2subsection are deemed waived if not delivered in writing to the office of the 
3superintendent of schools in that school administrative unit within 7 days of the last 
4publication of the newspaper advertisement. If an objection is received, the school board 
5shall conduct a hearing on the objection within 14 days of its receipt.  The school board 
6shall allow interested energy services companies to speak at the hearing and shall issue a 
7decision to either validate or invalidate the request for qualifications or the request for 
8proposals within 7 days of the close of the hearing.  A decision by the school board in 
9response to an objection is a final government action subject to appeal to the Superior 
10Court.
11SUMMARY
12This bill makes changes to the laws governing energy conservation improvements at 
13school administrative unit facilities, including amending the definition of "energy 
14services company" and removing the requirement that an agreement with an energy 
15services company must have a total contract cost of less than $2,500,000 in order for the 
16agreement to be deemed a professional service and not subject to competitive bidding 
17requirements.
