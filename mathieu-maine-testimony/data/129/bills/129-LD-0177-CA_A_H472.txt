Cunent biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan and provide 16 new specialized 
bariatric care nursing facility beds by September 1, 2020. The deparhnent must issue a Request for Information (RFI) 
to detennine potential providers of the service, adopt rnles with rate changes for the service, issue a Request for 
Proposals (RFP) and award contracts based on the RFP's received. Plior to the RFI process and rate development, 
which would take into account issues such as: the individual's specific needs, the staffing required and specialized 
equipment needs, the department would not know which facilities will be available for the beds and what the final 
rates might be for the service. It is anticipated that this will create a significant fiscal impact. However, the amount of 
the that impact cannot be determined at this time.
