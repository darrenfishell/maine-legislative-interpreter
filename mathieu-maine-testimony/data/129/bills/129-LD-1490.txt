2Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §2201, as amended by PL 2009, c. 158, §§1 to 3 and c. 290, 
3§22, is further amended to read:
4§2201.  Notice to licensing boards and obligor; judicial review
51.  Notice.  The department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized 
6Indian tribe, may serve notice upon a support obligor who is not in compliance with an 
7order of support that informs the obligor of the department's intention of the department, 
8or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, to submit the obligor's 
9name to the appropriate board as a licensee who is not in compliance with an order of 
10support.  The notice must inform the obligor that:
11A.  The obligor may request an administrative hearing to contest the issue of 
12compliance;
13B.  A request for hearing must be made in writing and must be received by the 
14department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, within 
1520 days of service;
16C.  If the obligor requests a hearing within 20 days of service, the department, or the 
17child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall stay the action to 
18certify the obligor to a board for noncompliance with an order of support pending a 
19decision after hearing;
20D.  If the obligor does not request a hearing within 20 days of service and is not in 
21compliance with an order of support, the department, or the child support agency of a 
22federally recognized Indian tribe, shall certify the obligor to the appropriate board for 
23noncompliance with an order of support;
24E.  If the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
25tribe, certifies the obligor to a board for noncompliance with an order of support, the 
26board must revoke the obligor's license and refuse to issue or reissue a license until 
27the obligor provides the board with a written confirmation of compliance from the 
28department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, that 
29states the obligor is in compliance with the obligor's order of support.  A revocation 
30by an agency or a refusal by an agency to reissue, renew or otherwise extend the 
31license or certificate of authority is deemed a final determination within the meaning 
32of Title 5, section 10002; and
33G.  The obligor can comply with an order of support by:
34(1)  Paying current support;
35(2)  Paying all past-due support or, if unable to pay all past-due support and a 
36periodic payment for past-due support has not been ordered by the court, by 
37making periodic payments in accordance with a written payment agreement with 
38the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe; 
39and
40(3)  Meeting the obligor's health insurance obligation.
Page 2 - 129LR1375(01)-11The notice must include the address and telephone number of the department's support 
2enforcement office, or of the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, 
3that issues the notice and a statement of the need to obtain a written confirmation of 
4compliance from that office as provided in subsection 8.  The department, or the child 
5support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall attach a copy of the obligor's 
6order of support to the notice.  Service of the notice must be made in the manner provided 
7for service of summons by the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4.  For purposes of 
8this subsection, this must be deemed to be an action pursuant to Chapter XIII of the 
9Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.  Personal service within the State of the notice described 
10in this subsection may be made by an authorized representative of the commissioner or of 
11the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe.
121-A.  Written agreement to pay past-due support.  An obligor who is presently 
13unable to pay all past-due support may come into compliance with the support order by 
14executing a written payment agreement with the department, or the child support agency 
15of a federally recognized Indian tribe, and by complying with that agreement.  A 
16condition of a written payment agreement must be that the obligor pay the current child 
17support when due.  Before a written payment agreement is executed, the obligor shall:
18A.  Disclose fully to the department, or the child support agency of a federally 
19recognized Indian tribe, in writing on a form prescribed by the department, or the 
20child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, the obligor's financial 
21circumstances, including income from all sources, assets, liabilities and work history 
22for the past year; and
23B.  Provide documentation to the department, or the child support agency of a 
24federally recognized Indian tribe, concerning the obligor's financial circumstances, 
25including copies of the most recent state and federal income tax returns, both 
26personal and business, a copy of a recent pay stub representative of current income 
27and copies of other records that show the obligor's income and the present value of 
28assets held by the obligor.
29After full disclosure, the department, or the child support agency of a federally 
30recognized Indian tribe, shall determine the obligor's ability to pay past-due support and 
31request the obligor to execute a written payment agreement consistent with the obligor's 
32ability to pay, not to exceed the limits on income withholding in section 2356.
331-B.  Failure to comply with written agreement.  Failure to comply with a written 
34payment agreement is grounds for license revocation unless the obligor notifies the 
35department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, that the 
36obligor is unable to comply with the agreement and provides the department, or the child 
37support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, with evidence of the obligor's 
38current financial circumstances to support the claim.  The consequences of failing to 
39comply with a written payment agreement and the requirements to avoid license 
40revocation, if the obligor can not comply with the agreement, must be stated in the 
41agreement.  If the obligor claims inability to comply with a written payment agreement, 
42the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, upon 
43motion to the District Court district court with jurisdiction, may request the court to 
44determine the obligor's ability to pay past-due support.  After notice and an opportunity 
45for hearing, the court may make a finding of money due, render judgment in that amount 
Page 3 - 129LR1375(01)-11and order any relief provided under sections 2603 and 2603-A.  For purposes of this 
2subsection, the commissioner may designate employees of the department, or the child 
3support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe may designate employees of the 
4agency, who are not attorneys to represent the department or the agency in District Court

10service of the notice described in subsection 1.  The request for hearing must be made in 
11writing and must be received by the department, or the child support agency of a federally 
12recognized Indian tribe, within 20 days of service.  The department, or the child support 
13agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall conduct hearings under this 
14subsection in accordance with the requirements of Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter IV 4.  
15The issues that may be determined at hearing are limited to whether the obligor is 
16required to pay child support under an order of support and whether the obligor is in 
17compliance with an order of support.  The obligor may raise additional issues, including 
18the reasonableness of a payment agreement in light of the obligor's current circumstances, 
19to be preserved for appeal.
203.  Decision after hearing.  The department, or the child support agency of a 
21federally recognized Indian tribe, shall render a decision after hearing without undue

23decision must be based on the hearing record and rules adopted by the commissioner.  
24The decision must inform the obligor that the obligor may file a petition for judicial 
25review of the decision within 30 days of the date of the decision.  The department, or the 
26child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall send an attested copy of 
27the decision to the obligor by regular mail to the obligor's most recent address of record.
284.  Appeal to Superior Court.  If the obligor appeals the department's decision of the 
29department, or of the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, under 
30subsection 3, the Superior Court may hear and determine issues raised at the hearing, 
31including the reasonableness of a payment agreement in light of the obligor's current 
32circumstances.
335.  Stay.  If an obligor timely requests a hearing to contest the issue of compliance, 
34the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, may 
35not certify the name of the obligor to a board for noncompliance with an order of support 
36until the department or agency issues a decision after hearing that finds the obligor is not 
37in compliance with an order of support.
386.  Certification of noncompliance.  The department, or the child support agency of 
39a federally recognized Indian tribe, may certify in writing to the appropriate board that a

42under subsection 1 and is not in compliance with an order of support 21 days after 
43service of the notice;
Page 4 - 129LR1375(01)-11B.  The department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian

3an order of support and the obligor has not appealed the decision within the 30-day 
4appeal period provided in subsection 3;

13department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, with 
14evidence of the obligor's current financial circumstances.

20without undue delay, that the obligor's application for the issuance or renewal of a license

24support.
258.  Written confirmation of compliance.  When an obligor who is served notice

27§2203.  Order to seize and sell
281.  Execution of support liens.  The department, or the child support agency of a 
29federally recognized Indian tribe, may issue an order to seize and sell to execute a support 
30lien established under former Title 19, section 503 or 503-A or section 2357 or to enforce 
31and collect any money judgment assessed under chapter 51, chapter 53, chapter 55, 
32chapter 63 or this chapter.  An order to seize and sell has the same effect as a writ of 
33execution issued by the District Court or the Superior Court.
342.  Issuance of order.  An order to seize and sell is an order, under official seal of the 
35department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, directed to 
36a county sheriff or a levying officer authorized by law to enforce a District Court or 
37Superior Court judgment or a judgment of a court of a federally recognized Indian tribe.  
38The order must command the recipient of the order to seize and sell specific nonexempt 
39real and personal property of an obligor to satisfy the support lien upon which the order is 
40based.  The department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
41tribe, must know or have reason to believe the obligor has a substantial ownership interest 
Page 7 - 129LR1375(01)-11in the property identified in the order.  Before issuing the order, the department, or the 
2child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, must search the records of the 
3applicable registry of deeds for real property and the records of the Secretary of State for 
4personal property to determine if there are other persons who have an ownership interest 
5in the property.
63.  Content of order.  An order to seize and sell must be signed by the commissioner 
7or the commissioner's designee, or by the designee of the child support agency of a 
8federally recognized Indian tribe.  The order must be for the amount of the support lien or 
9the amount of any other money obligation determined under this chapter, plus fees and 
10costs, if any.  The order must identify the specific property that is the subject of the order.  
11The order must include notice that tells the obligor and other persons who are known to 
12have an ownership interest in the property how to contest the seizure and sale of the 
13property, including notice of the right to an administrative hearing within 5 business days.  
14The order must list the type and value of property that is exempt as provided in 
15subsection 15.
164.  Order limited.  The county sheriff or levying officer may not seize property not 
17specifically identified in the order.
185.  Sheriff or levying officer.  An order to seize and sell may be sent by the 
19department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, to a county 
20sheriff or levying officer.  Upon receipt of the order, the sheriff or levying officer shall 
21proceed to execute the order in the same manner as prescribed for execution of a 
22judgment.  A sheriff or levying officer shall return the order, along with any funds 
23collected, to the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
24tribe, within 90 days of the receipt of the order.  Funds resulting from execution of the 
25order must first be applied to the sheriff's or levying officer's costs, then to any superior 
26liens and then to the support lien or other money obligation and any inferior liens of 
27which the department has notice.  Any amounts in excess of this distribution must be paid 
28to the obligor.  If the order is returned not fully satisfied, the department, or the child 
29support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, has the same remedies to collect 
30the deficiency as are available for any civil judgment.
316.  Right to hearing.  At least 20 calendar days before the sale, the department, or the 
32child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall serve a copy of the order 
33on the obligor and all other persons that the department, or the child support agency of a 
34federally recognized Indian tribe, knows have an ownership interest in the property 
35identified in the order.  Service of an order under this subsection must be made in the 
36manner provided for service of summons by the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4.  
37For purposes of this subsection, this service must be deemed to be an action pursuant to 
38Chapter XIII of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.  Personal service within the State of 
39a copy of the order may be made by an authorized representative of the commissioner.  
40The obligor and any other persons who claim an ownership interest in the property seized 
41under an order to seize and sell have a right to an administrative hearing to contest the 
42seizure and sale of the property and to establish the value of their relative interest in the 
43property.  A request for a hearing must be in writing and must be received by the 
44department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, within 10 
Page 8 - 129LR1375(01)-11calendar days of service of a copy of the order.  Upon receiving a request for a hearing, 
2the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, shall 
3notify all persons who the department, or the child support agency of a federally 
4recognized Indian tribe, has reason to believe have an ownership interest in the property 
5of the time, place and nature of the hearing.
6A.  Anyone requesting a hearing has the right to a preliminary hearing within 5 
7business days of the hearing request.  At the preliminary hearing, if the hearing 
8officer determines that there is reasonable ground to believe the seizure was lawful 
9and that the obligor owes a support debt that could be satisfied in whole or in part by 
10nonexempt property that has been seized, the hearing officer shall require the seizure 
11to remain in force and schedule a final hearing, allowing all parties reasonable time to 
12collect evidence and prepare for the final hearing.  If the hearing officer determines 
13that the seizure was not lawful or that the obligor does not owe a support debt that 
14could be satisfied in whole or in part by nonexempt property that has been seized, the 
15hearing officer shall declare the order to seize and sell void.
16B.  The department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
17tribe, shall notify any person who the department, or the child support agency of a 
18federally recognized Indian tribe, has reason to believe has an ownership interest in 
19the seized property of the time and place of the final hearing.  At the final hearing, the 
20hearing officer shall determine:
21(1)  Whether the obligor owes a support debt;
22(2)  Whether the support debt could be satisfied in whole or in part by the 
23property seized;
24(3)  The percentage share of ownership of all persons claiming an ownership 
25interest in the property;
26(4)  The amount of the debtor's interest in the property that is exempt; and
27(5)  The value of the interest in the property owned by nonobligor parties with an 
28interest superior to that of the department, or the child support agency of a 
29federally recognized Indian tribe.
307.  Commercially reasonable sale.  The sheriff or levying officer may sell the 
31property seized as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms not 
32otherwise prohibited by this section, but every aspect of the disposition including the 
33method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable.  The property 
34may not be sold for less than the debtor's interest in the property that is exempt.  The 
35property may not be sold for less than the full value of the interest in the property owned 
36by the nonobligor parties with an interest superior to that of the department, or of the 
37child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe.  The department, or the child 
38support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, reserves the right to reject any and 
39all bids.
408.  Notice of sale.  Within 30 days of receiving notice of a sale from the county 
41sheriff or levying officer, the department, or the child support agency of a federally 
42recognized Indian tribe, shall send by regular mail an accounting and proposed 
43distribution of the net proceeds of the sale to the obligor, all joint owners of the property 
Page 9 - 129LR1375(01)-11sold and any known lienholders with an interest in the property.  The accounting and 
2proposed distribution must include notice of the right to challenge the proposed 
3distribution at an administrative hearing within 30 days.  The department, or the child 
4support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, may not distribute the proceeds of 
5the sale until the appeal period has run and all appeals have been decided.
69.  Release.  Upon receiving payment in full of the order amount plus fees and costs, 
7if any, the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian tribe, 
8shall release the order to seize and sell.  Upon receiving partial payment of the order 
9amount or if the department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
10tribe, determines that a release or partial release of the order will facilitate the collection 
11of the unpaid amount, fees and costs, the department, or the child support agency of a 
12federally recognized Indian tribe, may release or may partially release the order to seize 
13and sell.  The department, or the child support agency of a federally recognized Indian 
14tribe, shall release the order if it determines the order is unenforceable.
1510.  Right to redeem.  An obligor or other person or entity having an interest in real 
16or personal property seized under an order to seize and sell at any time prior to the sale of 
17the property may pay the amount of the support lien or other money obligation and any 
18costs incurred by the county sheriff or levying officer serving the order.  Upon payment 
19in full, the property must be restored to the obligor or other person or entity having an 
20interest in that property and all proceedings on the order must cease.
2111.  Right to redeem after sale.  An obligor or other person or entity having an 
22interest in real property seized and sold by a county sheriff or levying officer pursuant to 
23an order to seize and sell may, within 240 days after the sale of the property, redeem the 
24property by making payment to the purchaser in the amount paid by the purchaser, plus 
25interest at the statutory interest rate payable on judgments recovered in the District Court 
26and the Superior Court.
