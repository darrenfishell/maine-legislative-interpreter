This bill authorizes the Office of the Attorney General to share information with courts, arbitrators and data 
clearinghouses to remain in compliance with the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). If this information is not able 
to be shared and the State is out of compliance with the MSA, payments collected pursuant to the MSA (Tobacco 
Settlement Funds) could cease. The Fund for a Healthy Maine, where these payments are deposited, has received $82 
million in fiscal year 2018-19.
