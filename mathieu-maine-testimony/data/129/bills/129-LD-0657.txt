2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5Maine voters amended the Constitution of Maine in 1967 and conditionally repealed 
6the office of Probate Judge and Register.  The repeal is to become effective when the 
7Legislature reforms the probate court system and provides it with full-time judges.  Many 
8legislative changes have been made to this system since that time. Most recently, the 
9128th Legislature passed Legislative Document 123, An Act To Recodify and Revise the 
10Maine Probate Code, Public Law 2017, chapter 402.  This was a comprehensive effort to 
11update each area of the law that involved the probate courts.  While these changes to the 
12Probate Code and similar changes since 1967 have made the system different, there have 
13been a number of unsuccessful legislative efforts to address the need for full-time judges 
14as envisioned by the constitutional amendment.  This bill proposes to honor the will of 
15the voters and complete that task by:
161.  Bringing the probate judge function into the state judicial branch by eliminating 
17the existing office of probate judge and creating a number of new full-time state court 
18judges who specialize in adjudicating probate law matters;
192.  Ensuring that Maine residents in all counties have equal and improved access to 
20the services of a judge in probate law matters by reasonably calculating the number of 
21new judge positions needed to fully meet this need; providing that judicial hearings will 
22be held in existing county probate courtrooms so long as these spaces are accessible to all 
23parties; and supplying recording devices and any other equipment necessary for the 
24administration of justice by a state court judge.  The judicial branch will be responsible 
25for providing any needed items and compensating the county for the use of the 
26courtrooms.  This bill proposes to provide the judicial branch the funding needed for 
27these purposes;
283.  Ensuring that all probate law records in all counties are contained in a 
29computerized system with a searchable database that is part of the judicial branch case 
30management system.  This bill proposes to provide a reasonable effective date for the 
31accomplishment of that goal and a General Fund appropriation sufficient to cover the 
32cost;
334.  Ensuring that Maine law provides that each county has an elected register of 
34probate with an office, staff and authority to deliver informal probate services that do not 
35require a judicial order to the public in a uniform manner.  This bill proposes to transfer 
36existing judicial oversight of the register to the state court judge having responsibility for 
37probate law matters in that county; and
385.  Providing continuing education through the judicial branch to each register of 
39probate to ensure a common understanding of the law and the responsibilities of a 
Page 2 - 129LR0287(01)-11register.  This bill proposes to ensure the participation of current registers in the planning, 
2development and presentation of these programs.
