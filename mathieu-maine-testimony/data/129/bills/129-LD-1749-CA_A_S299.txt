This bill directs the Depatiment of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to establish a pilot program for the indoor 
cultivation of hemp. The ACF estimates that establishing an indoor cultivation program would require additional staff 
and resources. This bill includes allocations of $84,296 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $108,233 in fiscal year 2020-21 for 
one Professional Licensing Supervisor position, for changing one half-time Certified Seed Specialist position to a 
seasonal position, for associated position costs and for contracted services for laboratory testing of product samples. 
Indoor growing will increase the number of licenses and the square footage subject to monitoring, sampling and testing 
fees, resulting in a revenue increase of $93,750 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $125,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. This 
estimate assumes that 100 growers would pay a $500 license fee and that each licensee would have an average of 
3,000 square feet subject to a 25¢ per square foot monitoring, sampling and testing fee.
