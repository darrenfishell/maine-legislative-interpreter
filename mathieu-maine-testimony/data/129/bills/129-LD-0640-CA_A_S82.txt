1 O Study of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions from the Proposed Central Maine Power 
11 Company Transmission Corridor" 
12 Amend the resolve by striking out everything after the emergency preamble and 
13 before the emergency clause and inserting the following: 
14 'Sec. 1. Greenhouse gas emissions reductions study of NECEC project. 
15 Resolved: That, except as otherwise provided in this section, the Department of 
16 Environmental Protection, referred to in this section as "the department," shall 
17 commission a study in accordance with this section regarding the potential effect of the 
18 New England Clean Energy Connect project, as proposed by Central Maine Power 
19 Company and referred to in this section as "the NECEC project," on total greenhouse gas 
20 emissions across all jurisdictions interconnected with electricity generation and 
21 distribution systems operated by the Hydro-Quebec company. The study must be based 
22 on a modeling analysis over the proposed NECEC project contract period 2023 to 2042, 
23 with and without construction of the NECEC project, that incorporates appropriate 
24 assumptions on factors such as load growth, fuel costs, variation in dispatch of electricity 
25 among electricity markets, rainfall, electricity transmission constraints, addition and 
26 retirement of electric generation facilities and technology development. The fmdings of 
27 the study must be in a form that allows for comparison of greenhouse gas emissions 
28 effects, with and without construction of the NECEC project, to a benchmark ofreducing 
29 greenhouse gas emissions in New England by 3.6 million metric tons per year. 
30 1. Except as provided in subsection 3, the department shall enter into an agreement 
31 with an independent, nongovernmental organization with expertise in energy and 
32 environmental policy and analysis, referred to in this section as "the consultant," to 
33 conduct the study described in this section. The consultant shall submit to the department 
34 a final report regarding its findings no later than July 31, 2019. The selection of the 
35 consultant and the agreement to produce the study as required by this section are not 
36 subject to the competitive bid requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 
37 chapter 155. The agreement must specify that, as necessary, the consultant is required to

for the study. The agreement must also require the consultant, with input from any 
2 entities that have been secured by the consultant to assist with modeling and analyses, to 
3 develop a scope of work and modeling assumptions to guide the study and to submit that 
4 scope of work and those modeling assumptions to the department to be submitted to the 
5 Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and to be posted on the 
6 department's publicly accessible website for a period of no less than 10 days. Within that 
7 period of time, a person may submit to the department written comments regarding the 
8 scope of work and modeling assumptions. The department shall submit all comments 
9 received to the consultant. 
10 2. The department may accept funds from any source, public or private, to fund the 
11 costs of the study and report described in subsection 1, including, but not limited to, costs 
12 of the consultant in entering into agreements with other entities to conduct modeling or 
13 other analyses required for the study, and may only fund the costs of the study and report 
14 using outside funding received under this subsection. The department must deposit all 
15 funds received for these purposes into the Maine Environmental Protection Fund 
16 established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 351, and those funds must be 
17 segregated from other funds in that account and may be used only for these purposes. 
18 3. On or before August 15, 2019, the department shall submit the final report 
19 prepared by the consultant under subsection 1 to the Joint Standing Committee on 
20 Environment and Natural Resources, except that, if the department, by August 15, 2019, 
21 fails to receive sufficient outside funding under subsection 2 to fund all costs necessary 
22 for completion of the study and report described in subsection 1, the department is not 
23 required to enter into an agreement with a consultant pursuant to subsection 1 or to 
24 submit a final report under this subsection and the 45-day prohibition on issuance of a 
25 permit, license or other approval relating to the NECEC project under subsection 4 does 
26 not apply. At least 7 days before submitting the report to the committee, the department 
27 shall post the report on the department's publicly accessible website. Within that period 
28 of time, a person may submit to the department written comments regarding the report.

33 accordance with subsection 3, except that this subsection does not apply if the

SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the resolve 
3 and directs the Department of Environmental Protection to commission a study regarding 
4 the potential effect of the New England Clean Energy Connect, or NECEC, project, as 
5 proposed by Central Maine Power Company, on total greenhouse gas emissions across all 
6 jurisdictions interconnected with electricity generation and distribution systems operated 
7 by the Hydro-Quebec company. The findings of the study regarding greenhouse gas 
8 emissions effects, with and without construction of the NECEC project, must be 
9 presented in relation to a benchmark of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in New 
10 England by 3.6 million metric tons per year. The study, which is to be prepared by a 
11 consultant that is an independent, nongovernmental organization with expertise in energy 
12 and environmental policy and analysis, must be based on a modeling analysis that 
13 incorporates appropriate assumptions regarding load growth, fuel costs, variation in 
14 dispatch of electricity among electricity markets, rainfall, electricity transmission 
15 constraints, addition and retirement of electric generation facilities and technology 
16 development. 
17 On or before August 15, 2019, the department is required to submit the final report 
18 prepared by the consultant to the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural 
19 Resources. The department may not issue a permit, license or other approval relating to 
20 the NECEC project until at least 45 days after it submits to the committee the final report 
21 prepared by the consultant, except that this 45-day prohibition does not apply if the 
22 department fails to submit the final report to the committee on or before August 15, 2019. 
2~ The department may accept funds from any source, public or private, to fund the 
24 costs of the study and report and may only fund the costs of the study and report using 
25 outside funding received for those purposes. If the department, by August 15, 2019, fails 
26 to receive sufficient outside funding for the study, the department is not required to enter 
27 into an agreement with the consultant to complete the study or to submit a final report to 
28 the committee and the 45-day prohibition does not apply.
