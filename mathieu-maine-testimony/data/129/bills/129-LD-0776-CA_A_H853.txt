13SUMMARY
14 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.  
15 It replaces the bill and replaces the special process to seal certain criminal records, found 
16 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, chapter 310, that was repealed by its own terms 
17 on October 1, 2019.
18 This amendment uses the same process to seal criminal records of an eligible criminal 
19 conviction as in the repealed law.  This amendment defines "eligible criminal conviction" 
20 to include all current and former Class D and Class E crimes except for:
21 1.  Class D or Class E crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 11, Sexual Assaults;
22 2.  Class D or Class E crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 12, Sexual Exploitation 
23 of Minors;
24 3.  The Class D and Class E crimes of aggravated sex trafficking, sex trafficking and 
25 patronizing prostitution of a minor or a person with a mental disability;
26 4.  Stalking and domestic violence stalking;
27 5.  Any crime involving domestic violence, unless the sentence has been commuted;
28 6.  A crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since 
29 entry of the judgment of conviction;
30 7.  A conviction for a violation of a condition of release for a charge that involves a 
31 crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since entry of the 
32 judgment of conviction;
33 8.  A conviction for a violation of a protective order under Title 5, section 4659, 
34 subsection 2; Title 15, section 321, subsection 6; Title 17-A, section 506-B; Title 19-A, 
35 section 4011, subsection 3; or Title 19-A, section 4012, subsection 5;
36 9.  A conviction for cruelty to animals; and
37 10.  A conviction for endangering the welfare of a child.
38 A person with an eligible criminal conviction may file a motion for the restrictions on

40 conviction if at least 4 years have passed since the person fully satisfied each of the 1

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT41 sentencing alternatives imposed for the conviction; the person has not been convicted of 
42 another criminal violation in this State, and has not had a criminal charge dismissed as a 
43 result of a deferred disposition, since satisfying the sentencing alternatives; the person has 
44 no criminal convictions in another jurisdiction since satisfying the sentencing alternatives; 
45 and the person has no presently pending criminal charges in this State or in another 
46 jurisdiction.
7 The court must hold a hearing on the motion and, if the court determines all the 
8 requirements have been met, the court must find the person entitled to the special 
9 restrictions and issue a written order certifying the determination.  A copy of the order must 
10 be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that prosecuted the person.  The order 
11 must also be provided to the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, State 
12 Bureau of Identification, which must promptly amend its records relating to the eligible 
13 criminal conviction.
14 If the person is convicted of a crime after the court's order, the new conviction 
15 extinguishes the entitlement.  The person is required to file notice of the new conviction, 
16 but if the person does not do so, the court is required to notify the person of the new 
17 conviction and offer an opportunity for a hearing to contest the fact of the new conviction.  
18 If the court determines that there is a new criminal conviction, the court must issue an order 
19 that the person is no longer eligible to have the criminal record sealed.  That order must be 
20 submitted to the State Bureau of Identification.
21 When a person's records are subject to the special restrictions on dissemination and 
22 use, the criminal history record information is confidential and may not be disseminated by 
23 a criminal justice agency to anyone except the following for limited purposes:  the person; 
24 a criminal justice agency; the Secretary of State; victims; the Department of Professional 
25 and Financial Regulation, Office of Securities; and financial institutions.
26 A person whose criminal conviction is covered by the special restrictions on 
27 dissemination and use may respond to inquiries from other than criminal justice agencies 
28 by not disclosing its existence without being subject to any sanctions.
29 The State may appeal as of right an order to seal a record; the person may appeal, but 
30 not as of right, when the court does not order the record sealed.
