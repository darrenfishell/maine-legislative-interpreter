transmission line and shall make such orders regarding its character, size, installation and 
maintenance and regarding nontransmission alternatives to the proposed transmission line 
as are necessa1y, having regard for any increased costs caused by the orders. +he In its 
review and consideration of nontransmission alternatives, as required by subsection 2-D, 
the commission shall give preference to the nontransmission alternatives that have been 
identified as able to address the identified need for the proposed transmission line at 
lower total oost to ra-tepay&s in this Sta-te most cost-effectively. When the oosts to 
ra-tepayers in this State cost-effectiveness of the identified nontransmission alternatives 
are reasonably equal, the commission shall give preference to the alternatives that 
produce the lowest amount of local air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.

6. Commission order; certificate of public convenience and necessity. In its 
order, the commission shall make specific findings with regard to the public need for the 
proposed transmission line. The commission shall make specific findings with regard to 
the likelihood that nontransmission alternatives can sufficiently address the identified 
public need over the effective life of the transmission line at lower total oost more cost­
effectively. Exoept as provided in subseotion 6 A for a high impaot oleotrio transmission 
line and in aooordanoe 'Nith subseotion 6 B regarding nontransmission alternatives, if !f 
the commission finds that a public need exists, after considering whether the need can be 
eoonomioally and reliably and more cost-effectively met using nontransmission 
alternatives, it shall issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the 
transmission line. In determining public need, the commission shall, at a minimum, take 
into account economics, reliability, public health and safety, scenic, historic and 
recreational values, state renewable energy generation goals, the proximity of the 
proposed transmission line to inhabited dwellings and nontransmission alternatives to

10 transmission line under this section before applying for approval under municipal 
11 ordinances adopted pursuant to Title 30-A, Part 2, Subpart 6-A; and Title 38, section 
12 438-A and, except as provided in subsection 4, before identifying a specific route or route 
13 options for the proposed transmission line. Except as provided in subsection 4, the 
14 commission may not consider the petition insufficient for failure to provide identification 
15 of a route or route options for the proposed transmission line. The issuance of a 
16 certificate of public convenience and necessity establishes that, as of the date of issuance 
17 of the certificate, the decision by the person to erect or constrnct was prudent. At the 
18 time of its issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the commission 
19 shall send to each municipality through which a proposed corridor or corridors for a 
20 transmission line extends a separate notice that the issuance of the certificate does not 
21 override, supersede or otherwise affect municipal authority to regulate the siting of the 
22 proposed transmission line. The commission may deny a certificate of public convenience 
23 and necessity for a transmission line upon a finding that the transmission line is 
24 reasonably likely to adversely affect any transmission and distribution utility or its 
25 customers. 
26 Sec. 12. 35-A MRSA §3132-A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 201, §§5 and 6, is 
27 further amended to read:

2 effeotive life of the nronosed transmission nroieet. 
3 2. Commission approval of a proposed transmission project; nontransmission 
4 alternatives. In order for a transmission project to be approved, the commission must 
5 consider whether the identified need over the effective life of the proposed transmission 
6 project can be eoonomioally and reliably and more cost-effectively met using 
7 nontransmission alternatives at a lower total oost. During In its review and consideration 
8 of nontransmission alternatives, as required by subsection 1-A. the commission shall give 
9 preference to nontransmission alternatives that are have been identified as able to address 
10 the identified need for the proposed transmission project at low& total oost to ratepayers 
11 most cost-effectively. Of the identified nontransmission akematives, the oommission 
12 shall give preferenoe to the lowest oost nontransmission alt6fllatives. When the oosts to 
13 ratepayers cost-effectiveness of the identified nontransmission alternatives are reasonably 
14 equal, the commission shall give preference to the alternatives that produce the lowest 
15 amount oflocal air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions. 
16 3. Exception. A transmission project that is constructed, owned and operated by a 
17 generator of electricity solely for the purpose of electrically and physically 
18 interconnecting the generator to the transmission system of a transmission and 
19 distribution utility is not subject to this section. 
20 Sec. 13. 35-A MRSA §3132-B is enacted to read: 
21 §3132-B. Small transmission and distribution projects

2. Nonwires alternatives investigation. Except as provided in subsection 3, for a 
proposed project presented in a planning study under subsection 1, the nonwires 
alternative coordinator: 
A. Shall investigate nonwires alternatives if the project is a small transmission 
project or is a distribution project estimated to cost $500,000 or more: and 
B. May investigate nonwires alternatives if the project is a distribution project 
estimated to cost less than $500,000 and, in the judgment of the nonwires alternative 
coordinator, there is a reasonable likelihood that a nonwires alternative would be 
more cost-effective than the proposed distribution project. 
An investigation of nonwires alternatives under this subsection must be conducted in 
accordance with section 3132-C. 
3. Excluded projects; criteria. The commission, by rule, shall develop criteria to 
exclude from investigation by the nonwires alternative coordinator small transmission 
projects and distribution projects best suited to transmission and distribution investments, 
including but not limited to projects that are: 
A. Necessary for redundant supply to a radial load: 
B. Necessary to address maintenance, asset condition or safety needs: 
C. Necessary to address stability or short circuit problems: or 
D. Required to be in service within one year based on the controlling load forecast. 
4. Nonwires alternatives recommendations. Based on the investigation under 
subsection 2, the nonwires alternative coordinator shall make recommendations to the 
investor-owned transmission and distribution utility regarding nonwires alternatives to 
proposed small transmission projects and distribution projects. The nonwires alternative 
coordinator and the utility shall attempt to reach a good faith agreement regarding the 
adoption of nonwires alternatives that are most cost-effective. If agreement is reached, 
the utility shall pursue the agreed-upon nonwires alternatives. If there is no agreement, 
the utility shall petition the commission to resolve the dispute. 
5. Dispute resolution. In responding to a petition by an investor-owned 
transmission and distribution utility pursuant to subsection 4, the commission shall 
review the planning study prepared under subsection 1 and the recommendations of the 
nonwires alternative coordinator under subsection 4. In resolving the dispute, the 
commission shall give preference to nonwires alternatives that are identified as able to 
address the identified need for the proposed small transmission project or distribution 
project and are most cost-effective. Of the identified nonwires alternatives, the 
commission shall give preference to the lowest-cost nonwires alternatives. When the 
costs to ratepayers in this State of the identified nonwires alternatives are reasonably 
equal, the commission shall give preference to the nonwires alternatives that produce the 
lowest amount oflocal air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.

1. Investigation required. The nonwires alternative coordinator shall conduct an 
investigation of and make recommendations regarding nonwires alternatives to a wires 
project under section 3132, 3132-A or 3132-B in accordance with this section. The 
investigation must be conducted in coordination with the Efficiency Maine Trust. For the 
purposes of this section, "wires project" means a transmission line and associated 
infrastructure subject to the requirements of section 3132, a transmission project as 
defined in section 3132-A or a small transmission project or distribution project covered 
by section 3132-B. 
2. Investigation methods; benefit-cost analysis. An investigation under subsection 
1 must set forth the total projected costs and annual carrying costs of the wires project 
and the nonwires alternatives over the effective life of the wires project. The investigation 
must include a benefit-cost analysis that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of nonwires 
alternatives as compared to the wires project, under which: 
A. Benefits and costs are measured in net present value: 
B. Benefits reflect total, quantifiable avoided costs and are calculated from the 
perspective of the investor-owned transmission and distribution utility and ratepayers, 
including any deferral value; and 
C. Costs are calculated from the perspective of the investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utility. For a nonwires alternative, costs include the utility's cost of any 
contracts required to deliver the nonwires alternative but do not include any ratepayer 
contributions to the cost of the nonwires alternative. 
3. Data. An investor-owned transmission and distribution utility shall provide data 
requested by the Public Advocate or the Efficiency Maine Trust, subject to enforcement 
by the commission, to allow the nonwires alternative coordinator, in conjunction with the 
trust, to carry out investigation and analysis under this section. The trust shall use utility 
ratepayer usage data to identify cost-effective nonwires alternatives on the customer side 
of the meter. An investor-owned transmission and distribution utility may request a 
protective order if necessary to protect the confidentiality of data provided under this 
section in accordance with section 1311-A. 
4. Recommendations. On the basis of the investigation under subsection 1, the 
nonwires alternative coordinator shall develop and provide to the commission or to an 
investor-owned transmission and distribution utility, as appropriate, recommendations 
regarding cost-effective nonwires alternatives to the wires project, including a proposed 
plan for procurement of the recommended nonwires alternatives. The proposed 
procurement plan must be consistent with the provisions of section 3132-D. 
Sec. 15. 35-A MRSA §3132-D is enacted to read:

27 distribution utilities. 
28 3. It adjusts the salary range of the Special Assistant to the Public Advocate from 
29 range 20 to range 25. 
30 4. It amends the definition of "transmission project" to cover projects expected to

32 5. It amends the provisions relating to transmission lines and transmission projects 
33 subject to investigation of nonwires alternatives in several ways. It limits the requirement 
34 for a nonwires alternative investigation to apply to transmission lines and projects

6. It establishes cost-effectiveness as the analytical framework and standard for the 
investigation of nonwires alternatives for all types of projects and requires a benefit-cost 
analysis to evaluate cost-effectiveness. It requires the nonwires alternative coordinator to 
develop and make recommendations regarding the cost-effectiveness of nonwires 
alternatives and a proposed plan for procurement of nonwires alternatives. 
7. It requires an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to submit 
annually to the Office of the Public Advocate a planning study for small transmission and 
distribution projects. 
8. It requires the nonwires alternative coordinator to provide recommendations to 
investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities for nonwires alternatives to small 
transmission projects and distribution projects and requires the coordinator and the utility 
to attempt to reach a good faith agreement on the adoption of nonwires alternatives. If no 
agreement is reached, the utility is required to petition the Public Utilities Commission to 
resolve the dispute. 
9. It includes provisions regarding procurement of nonwires alternatives. These 
provisions require a transmission and distribution utility to contract with the Efficiency 
Maine Trust to deliver nonwires alternatives that are on the customer side of the meter

party, to deliver nonwires alternatives that are on the grid side of the meter. 
10. It provides that a transmission and distribution utility's prudently incurred costs 
to deliver nonwires alternatives are recoverable in rates. 
11. It adds a provision to reference the activities of the nonwires alternative 
coordinator in the Efficiency Maine Trust Act regarding coordination with activities and 
programs of state agencies and authorities. 
12. It makes changes to the law on smart grid infrastmcture policy and establishes

This bill authorizes the Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) to contract with a person or entity to serve as a 
nonwires alternative coordinator (NAC) and to collect an additional special assessment on the intrastate gross 
operating revenues of investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to fund the costs associated with the 
NAC contract. The bill also defines the duties and scope of work for the NAC and includes non wires alternatives 
consideration requirements in the rules regarding proposed transmission and distribution projects under the authority 
of the Public Utilities Commission. The bill also increases the salaty of the Special Assistant to the Public Advocate 
position from salary range 20 to salary range 25. Based on previous costs for contacted services from consultants, 
the OPA estimates that the contract for a NAC will require additional allocations of $800,000 annually beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20. This bill also includes allocations of $3,039 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $4,052 in fiscal year 
2020-21 for the salaty range increase of the Special Assistant to the Public Advocate position. 
Because the OP A is funded by an assessment set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the 
Legislature for operating the OP A, any increased costs require a conesponding increase in revenue from the 
assessment on the intrastate gross operating revenues of utility and qualified telecommunications providers. Because 
this bill also allows an additional special assessment on investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to fund 
the NAC, some investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities may incur additional costs as a result. These 
costs may be passed on to electric utility customers through scheduled rate cases. The amount of these costs cannot 
be dete1mined at this time.
