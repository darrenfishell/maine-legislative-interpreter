The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 
$2,798,184 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $5,642,972 in fiscal year 2020-21 to amend its rule Chapter 101: MaineCare 
Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 67, Principles of Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities no later than January I, 
2020 to include the costs of health insurance in the fixed costs component of reimbursement. Federal Expenditures 
Fund allocations are also included for the FMAP match. 
The Upper Payment Limit (UPL) analysis for Nursing Facilities (NF) indicates that currently the NF payments in 
MaineCare are lower than Medicare by $12.5 million. The annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) for the NF's will 
go into effect on July I, 2019 and are estimated to increase the payments by $10.6 million. The impact of this change 
on the UPL will be limited by an increase to the Medicare rates to which the MaineCare rates are compared, but 
between the COLA and the cost from this bill, the NF costs will likely go over the UPL threshold. However, based on 
the language in statute (Title 22 ยง 1708 sub-ยง3, 1C) the DHHS must establish reimbursement rates that "are consistent 
with federal requirements relative to limits on reimbursement under the federal Social Security Act, Title XIX." Thus, 
the estimate of costs above includes all increases associated with the health insurance moving to fixed costs, with a 
federal match. If this does create a UPL issue, the DHHS will limit the payments to NF's to remain below the federally 
required limits.
