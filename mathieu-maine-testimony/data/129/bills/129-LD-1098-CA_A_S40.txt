This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $68,064 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $91,546 in fiscal year 2020-21 
to the Regulation and Enforcement program within the Department of Labor for one Labor and Safety Inspector 
position and related All Other costs necessary to respond to an anticipated increase in the number of reported 
instances of violations associated with the establishment of an alternative minimum wage for certain areas of the 
State. 
This bill establishes an alternative minimum wage for all areas of the State other than Cumberland County except for 
the towns of Baldwin, Bridgton, Harrison and Naples. The alternative minimum wage increases the hourly wage by 
50 cents per hour on January 1, 2021 and an additional 50 cents per hour on January 1, 2022 instead of $1.00 per hour 
on January 1, 2020. The bill also delays the cost-of-living adjustment for the current minimum wage to January 1, 
2024, changes the timing of the increase from every year to every 3 years and changes the calculation of the increase 
from the average increase over the prior year to the average increase over the prior 3 years. 
These changes in the minimum wage law may result in savings to the State and municipalities beginning in fiscal year 
2019-20, depending on the wages currently in place and decisions on future wages when increases required by law are 
less than they would have been under current law.
