6SUMMARY
7Under current law, arbitrations under labor relations laws governing municipal public 
8employees, University of Maine System employees, state employees and judicial 
9employees require that each party select one arbitrator and those 2 arbitrators select a 
10neutral 3rd arbitrator.  This bill requires that the neutral 3rd arbitrator be selected from a 
11panel of arbitrators appointed by the Governor from a list of nominations supplied by the 
12Maine Labor Relations Board.  Under the bill, appointees to the panel of arbitrators serve 
13as impartial arbitrators of the interests of the public in the settlement of disputes between 
14employers and employees or their representatives, and each appointee must reside in the 
15State.  In addition, this bill:
161. Amends the labor relations laws governing municipal public employees and 
17University of Maine System employees to provide that determinations by arbitrators with 
18respect to controversies over all subjects, including salaries, pensions and insurance, are 
19final and binding on the parties;
202. Amends the labor relations laws governing state employees to provide that, with 
21respect to controversies over salaries, an arbitrator's determinations are final and binding 
22on the parties;
233. Amends the labor relations laws governing judicial employees to provide that an 
24arbitrator's determinations with respect to controversies over all subjects, including 
25salaries, pensions and insurance, are final and binding on the parties and that, with respect 
26to controversies over salaries, determinations by mediator-arbitrators are final and 
27binding on the parties;
284. Adds specific factors an arbitrator must consider when a controversy is not 
29resolved between a public employer and bargaining agent under the municipal public 
30employees labor relations law; 
315.  Provides that, if a public employer fails to enter into an agreement to carry out and 
32effectuate binding determinations made by arbitrators, the public employees are 
33authorized to strike;
346.  Requires that cost items in a collective bargaining agreement arrived at through 
35arbitration may not be included in the state or local operating budget, as relevant, for the 
36current fiscal year, but must instead be submitted for inclusion in the operating budget for 
37the following fiscal year; and
387. Provides an effective date for the changes made in the bill of July 1, 2021.
