15SUMMARY
16This bill changes the term "adult supervisor" to "apprentice supervisor" in the law 
17governing apprentice hunter license restrictions.  It eliminates the threshold prohibiting 
18persons younger than 18 years of age from transferring a valid anterless deer permit to a 
19junior hunter.  It repeals the provision requiring the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and 
20Wildlife to designate locations where guide license examinations will be held.  It also 
21removes the requirement that a license must be obtained from the Department of Inland 
22Fisheries and Wildlife to operate a motorboat carrying passengers for hire and instead 
23requires proof of successful completion of a boater safety education course approved by a 
24national association of state boating law administrators.
