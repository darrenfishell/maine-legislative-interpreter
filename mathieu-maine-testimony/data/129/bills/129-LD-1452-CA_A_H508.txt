16 SUMMARY 
17 This amendment enacts definitions and other provisions to require a marketplace 
18 facilitator to collect and remit the sales tax on sales of tangible personal property and 
19 taxable services facilitated on the marketplace facilitator's marketplace that are delivered 
20 into the State. It consolidates the sales tax registration provisions by repealing the 
21 recently enacted Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 1951-B and reformatting the 
22 provision of law requiring certain persons to register with the State Tax Assessor and 
23 collect and remit taxes, including the remote seller registration requirements in the new 
24 provision, harmonizing the merged provisions and removing obsolete language. It also 
25 adjusts the use tax calculation used on the income tax return to report unpaid use tax, 
26 lowering the default amount from .08% to .04% of Maine adjusted gross income to 
27 account for the increased tax collected by remote sellers and marketplace facilitators.

fiscal year 2019-20 and $16,620,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. It would also result in an increase in Local Government 
Fund revenue of $650,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $870,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. The Department of 
Administrative and Financifil Services will require an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $115, 719 for one 
Revenue Agent position beginning in fiscal year 2021-22 when audits of marketplace facilitators will begin.
