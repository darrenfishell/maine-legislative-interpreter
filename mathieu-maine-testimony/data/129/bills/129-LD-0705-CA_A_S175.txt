D. The prior authorization standards used by a carrier must be clear and readily

evaluate a request, and the carrier must make best efforts to limit requests for 
additional information. 
If a carrier does not grant or deny a request for prior authorization within the time frames 
required under this subsection, the request for prior authorization by the provider is 
granted.

any prior authorization requirements on a pregnant woman for medication-assisted 
treatment for opioid use disorder. For the purposes of this subsection, "medication­
assisted treatment" means an evidence-based practice that combines pharmacological 
interventions with substance use disorder counseling.

prescription drug programs for electronic prescribing transactions. For the purposes of 
this subsection, transmission of a facsimile through a proprietary payer portal or by use of

of prior authorization requests that meet requirements of the federal Health Insurance

prior authorization process for health insurance carriers. 
1. It reduces the time frame for a carrier's response to a prior authorization request 
from 2 business days to 72 hours or 2 business days, whichever is less, and clarifies that 
the same time frame for a response applies in instances when a carrier requests additional

authorization is granted if a carrier fails to respond within the required time frames. 
2. It clarifies a provision in existing law to reflect the change in time frame. 
3. It prohibits a carrier from requiring prior authorization for medication-assisted 
treatment for opioid use disorder for the prescription of at least one drug for each type of 
medication used in medication-assisted treatment, except that a carrier may not require 
prior authorization for medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder for a 
pregnant woman. 
4. It requires a health insurance carrier to develop an electronic transmission system 
for prior authorization of prescription drug orders by January 1, 2020. 
5. It requires health insurance carriers to report, no later than January 1, 2020, to the 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services on 
efforts to develop standards for secure electronic transmission of prior authorization 
requests. It also authorizes the committee to report out legislation to the Second Regular 
Session of the 129th Legislature related to the electronic transmission of prior 
authorization requests for medical services. 
6. It directs the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of 
Insurance to amend its rules regarding health plan accountability to conform to the 
statutory changes and designates those rules as routine technical.
