Page 1 - 129LR3333(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 has 
4 created a public health emergency; and
5Whereas, in response to this public health emergency, the Governor issued an 
6 executive order on March 18, 2020 requiring all restaurants and bars, including tasting 
7 rooms, to close their dine-in facilities but permitting restaurants and bars to offer carry-out, 
8 delivery and drive-through food and beverage services, including carry-out, delivery and 
9 drive-through liquor sales; and
10Whereas, although restaurants across the State were permitted to reopen June 17, 
11 2020, restaurants are required to limit indoor seating capacity to prevent spread of the virus 
12 while the reopening of bars and tasting rooms has been postponed until further notice; and
13Whereas, it is impossible to ascertain when the current public health emergency will 
14 abate, rendering the economic survival of restaurants, bars and tasting rooms dependent on 
15 their continued ability to provide carry-out, delivery and drive-through food and beverage 
16 services, including carry-out, delivery and drive-through liquor sales; and
17Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
19 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
20 therefore,
21Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

23 container.  Spirits may be sold for off-premises consumption only as an ingredient of an 
24 approved cocktail, which must be sealed in a tamper-evident container bearing a label 
25 identifying the vendor.  A person who delivers wine, malt liquor or approved cocktails to 
26 a customer by motor vehicle must be at least 21 years of age and the liquor may not be 
27 transported in the passenger area of the motor vehicle.
28 The bill directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 
29 Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to adopt rules governing the categories of on-
30 premises retailers that may engage in liquor take-out and delivery services, the type of food 
31 order that must accompany a take-out or delivery sale of liquor and the requirements for 
32 sealing and labeling the tamper-evident containers in which approved cocktails must be 
33 sold.
