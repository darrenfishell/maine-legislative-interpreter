26 SUMMARY 
27 This amendment replaces the bill. It requires that the history of genocide, including 
28 the Holocaust, to be taught in schools, aligned with the parameters for essential 
29 instruction and graduation requirements and included in the review of content standards 
30 and performance indicators of the system of learning results. It adds an appropriations 
31 and allocations section. 
32 The fiscal note on this amendment identifies certain requirements in the amendment 
33 as a potential state mandate. In order to be a mandate pursuant to the Constitution of 
34 Maine, a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or modify its 
35 activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The committee 
36 finds that the provision in the bill requiring the history of genocide to be taught in

schools, the provision the fiscal note identifies as potentially a mandate, does not create a 
2 mandate since the history of genocide relates to topics already required to be taught in 
3 schools and so should not cause any school to expand or modify its activities so as to 
4 necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $9,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 to the Leaming Systems 
program within the Department of Education for the costs associated with holding meetings with stakeholders to 
revise the social studies standards. The department has indicated that it has just completed a review of the social 
studies standards and, therefore, has not requested funding in the 2020-2021 biennial budget to conduct another 
review.
