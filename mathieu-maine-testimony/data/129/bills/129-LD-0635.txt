31-A.  If the court imposes a sentencing alternative that includes a period of deferred 
4disposition, the court may, with the express approval of the prosecuting attorney, require

19Sec. 4.  17-A MRSA §1348-A, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2005, c. 288, §1, is 
20further amended to read:
211.    Following the acceptance of a plea of guilty for a crime for which a person is 
22eligible for a deferred disposition under section 1348, the court may order sentencing 
23deferred to a date certain or determinable and impose requirements upon the person, to be 
24in effect during the period of deferment, considered by the court to be reasonable and 
25appropriate to assist the person to lead a law-abiding life.  The court-imposed deferment 
26requirements must include a requirement that the person refrain from criminal conduct 
27and may include a requirement that the person pay to the appropriate county an 
28administrative supervision fee of not more than $50 per month, as determined by the 
29court, for the term of the deferment.  In determining the amount of the fee, the court shall 
30take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden its 
31payment imposes.  The court-imposed deferment requirements may include a requirement 
32that a person appear before a community reparations board pursuant to section 1204-A, 
33subsection 1-A.  In exchange for the deferred sentencing, the person shall abide by the 
34court-imposed deferment requirements.  Unless the court orders otherwise, the 
35requirements are immediately in effect.

2subject to the deferred disposition appear before a community reparations board and 
3abide by any requirement imposed by the board if the court finds no circumstance that
