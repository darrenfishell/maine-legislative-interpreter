8This amendment is the majority report of the committee.  The amendment removes 
9from the bill that section of Part A that amends the definition of "debt buyer" and 
10removes all of Part B, which repeals mortgage lending restrictions applicable to nonbank 
11mortgage lenders, and makes corresponding changes. The amendment also removes a 
12provision in Part A that authorizes the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection 
13within the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation to lower or suspend fees 
14by order. 
15The amendment makes changes to Part D of the bill to change the timeline for the 
16required reports from quarterly or semiannually to annually. The bill proposes to 
17eliminate the reporting requirements. The amendment also removes language in Part D 
18related to the consolidation of accounts within the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection.
19The amendment adds Part E, which makes it a violation of the Maine Fair Debt 
20Collection Practices Act to collect or attempt to collect a debt from medical expenses 
21against an individual eligible for free or charity care. 
22The amendment also adds Part F to the bill. Part F adds requirements relating to 
23collection actions for credit card debt and student loan debt. Part F also authorizes the 
24Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protection to permit affiliated companies to be under

Fiscal Detail and Notes
Any additional costs or revenues accruing to the Department  of Professional and Financial Regulation as a result of 
this bill are expected to be minor. This bill requires that all student loan debt collection cases be filed as civil actions. These cases are currently filed as 
small claims cases, which include a mediation fee collected by the judicial department. Moving these cases to civil 
filings would result in a loss of this mediation fee, whic h is estimated to total about $84,000 annually. Assuming this 
bill is effective in December, it is estimated revenue will fall by $49,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
