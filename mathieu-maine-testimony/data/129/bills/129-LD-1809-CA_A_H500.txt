The bill includes one-time General Fund appropriations to the Depatiment of Health and Human Services of $472,317 
in fiscal year 2019-20 for a one-time increase to certain rates under rule Chapter 101, MaineCare Benefits Manual, 
Chapters II and III, Section 65 by 20% until June 30, 2020 Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for 
the FMAP match. 
This estimate assumes all costs will be covered by General Fund appropriations because of PL 2017 c. 460, which 
increased rates for services in sections 17, 23 and 65, which are included in the Clinic Upper Payment Limit 
calculations. The impact of those increases put the department at or slightly above the amount allowed to be paid by 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result, the rate increase in this bill will be paid with state 
General Fund money only. 
The rate study required in the bill was originally funded in PL 2017 c.460, but the study was never completed. This 
funding was carried forward and will be utilized to complete the rate study by December 1, 2019.
