Page 2 - 129LR0736(04)-1
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1Whereas, access to parcel, engineering, zoning and other geographic information 
2developed by Maine communities is important to the efficient operations of state 
3agencies; and
4Whereas, access to historical geographic information provides key context to 
5changes in the State's resources, development and environmental patterns and informs 
6decision making and research; and
7Whereas, economic development, planning for climate change and many other 
8activities require research and analysis based on access to both current and historical 
9geographic information; and
10Whereas, the primary focus of the Office of Information Technology and the Office 
11of Geographic Information Systems is providing software and data protection for state 
12agencies, not providing access for nonstate agencies; and
13Whereas, geographic information system data is far different from ordinary data 
14required by most Office of Information Technology users and requires different protocols 
15for delivery and storage, and many nonstate users of data do not use the same software as 
16geographic information system users within state agencies; and
17Whereas, opportunities for grants and partnerships to acquire and distribute data 
18may not coincide with the state budgeting process and may require more flexible access 
19to required matching funds; and
20Whereas, the importance of accurate geospatial data is recognized as fundamental 
21to the well-being of the State's citizens and to the efficiency of both governmental and 
22nongovernmental activities in the State; and
23Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
24the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
25immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
