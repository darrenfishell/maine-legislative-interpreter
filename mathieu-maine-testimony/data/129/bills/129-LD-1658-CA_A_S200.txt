Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential current biennium cost increase -Highway Fund 
This bill may increase the number of projects that are considered public works and thus subject to prevailing wage 
requirements. Any new projects now considered public works undertaken by the State could face increased costs as a 
result of needing to meet prevailing wage requirements. No estimate of the number of projects that may be affected is 
made at this time, but the number is not expected to be significant.
