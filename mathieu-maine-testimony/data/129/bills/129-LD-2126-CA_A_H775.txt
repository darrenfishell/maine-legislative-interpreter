(3-A) Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner shall compute a reserve 
multiple to determine the schedule and planned yield in effect for a rate year. The 
reserve multiple is determined by dividing the fund reserve ratio by the average 
benefit cost rate. The determination date is October 31st of each calendar year.

(5) The commissioner shall determine the contribution rates effective for a rate 
year by multiplying the predetermined yield by the experience factors for each 
contribution category. Contribution category 20 in the table in subparagraph (2) 
must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%. The employer's experience 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) that 
corresponds with the employer's contribution category in column A, except that 
the experience factors in column E must be used to determine the contribution 
rates for rate years 2000 and 2001 and those in column D must be used for rate 
years 2002 and 2003. Beginning January 1, 2018, for rate years when schedule A 
is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3-A), the experience factor in 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of

the schedule. The altered position on the schedule does not affect the position of 
any other employer.
