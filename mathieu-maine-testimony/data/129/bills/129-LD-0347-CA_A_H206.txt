SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment does the 
following: 
1. It amends the law governing the use of the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund after 
all liquor operation revenue bonds and any ancillary obligations secured by the fund have 
been retired to provide additional funding for water and wastewater infrastructure. 
Specifically, while current law provides a maximum of 15% of funds available after 
retirement of the bonds be used for matching funds for federal programs for drinking 
water and wastewater systems, the amendment provides 30% of funds after bond 
retirement be designated for drinldng water and wastewater purposes. The amendment 
divides the 30% between drinldng water and wastewater at 45% and 55% respectively. 
For both drinking water and wastewater the amendment provides the funds first be used 
for the state match for federal funds for revolving loans. 
2. It amends the law governing the State Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Fund 
and the Maine Clean Water Fund to allow the funds to be used to provide assistance for 
capital investment in private and commercial wastewater systems.

Committee: Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Future biennimn revenue decrease -Maine Budget Stabilization Fund 
Future biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This bill would change how the revenues from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund (LORF) are used after all liquor 
operation revenue bonds and ancillary obligations have been paid off in fiscal year 2023-24. Cmrent law requires that 
after the bonds are paid off 15% of the revenue is to be divided equally between the Depmiment of Health and 
Human Services and the Department ofEnviromnental Protection for revolving loan funds for drinking water systems 
and wastewater treatment, 35% will go to the Department of Transportation for construction of highways and b1idges 
and 50% will go to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The new distribution of the LORF revenue after fiscal year 2023-24 would be as follows: 30% instead of 15% is to 
be divided 45/55 instead of equally between the DHHS and the DEP with 45% to DHHS for revolving loans for 
drinking ,vater systems and 55% to the DEP for revolving loans for wastewater treatment; 35% will still go to the 
Department of Transportation for constrnction of highways and bridges and 35% instead of 50% will go to the Maine 
Budget Stabilization Fund. These changes would all occur after June of 2024. 
The bill also contains provisions to maximize the amount of federal matching funds that may be received for the 
drinking water and wastewater programs.
