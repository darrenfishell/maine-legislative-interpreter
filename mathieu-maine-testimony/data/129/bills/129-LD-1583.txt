12SUMMARY
13This bill establishes the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Act.  It provides a 
14public financing mechanism for committees that are Maine-chartered nonprofits or 
15groups whose principal officers are Maine citizens and are formed to support or oppose a 
16direct initiative of legislation or a people's veto or to support a competing measure to a 
17direct initiative of legislation.  The funding process is similar to that provided for clean 
18election candidates under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, chapter 14.  It provides 
19for limits on the amount of funds that committees seeking public funding may raise and 
20spend prior to qualifying for public funding and the amount of qualifying contributions 
21that a committee must raise to be certified to receive public funding, and it establishes the 
22amounts that certified committees may receive.  It also establishes procedures governing 
23financial reporting and accounting, appeals of decisions, penalties for violations and other 
24procedural matters to ensure the integrity of the process.  In addition to other available 
25funds, including qualifying contributions raised by committees and voluntary 
26contributions through a tax checkoff program, funding for certified committees is 
27provided by an annual appropriation of $3,000,000.
