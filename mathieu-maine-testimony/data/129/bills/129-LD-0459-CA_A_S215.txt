10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, changes the 
12 definition of "homelessness" in the bill to remove references to a need for permanent or 
13 safe housing. It adds a requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services to 
14 reimburse a municipality 100% of direct general assistance costs after a person has spent 
15 90 consecutive nights homeless or in an emergency shelter for the homeless. It also 
16 establishes presumptive eligibility for general assistance for 30 days for persons who are 
17 provided shelter at emergency shelters for the homeless and specifies that no other 
18 municipality may be determined to be the municipality of responsibility during that 30-
19 day period. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a 
20 work group of stakeholders to examine the municipal general assistance program and 
21 report findings to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services no later 
22 than January 2, 2020.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes presumptive eligibility for general assistance (GA) for 30 days for persons who are provided 
shelter at emergency shelters for the homeless. Additionally, the bill requires the Department of Health and human 
Services (DHHS) to reimburse municipalities 100% of direct GA costs after a person has spent 90 consecutive nights 
homeless. This will potentially increase assistance payments made by municipalities and increase amounts reimbursed 
to municipalities by the DHHS. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible because recipient data 
related to number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number of recipients who return and the 
frequency of homelessness resides at the municipal level and varies over time. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to convene a workgroup to examine the GA 
program and report back to the legislature are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
