19 2. It requires that all compensation remitted by or on behalf of a pharmaceutical 
20 manufacturer, developer or labeler, directly or indirectly, to a carrier or to a pharmacy 
21 benefits manager related to its prescription drug benefit must be remitted directly to the 
22 covered person at the point of sale or to the carrier to offset premiums for covered

26 4. It clarifies that the definition of "carrier" does not include a multiple-employer 
27 welfare arrangement if the multiple-employer welfare arrangement contracts with a 3rd-
28 party administrator to manage and administer health benefits, including benefits for
