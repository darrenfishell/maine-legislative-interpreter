2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, financial institutions in this State are committed to preventing elder 
4financial abuse; and
5Whereas, the change in procedure for opening a multiple-party account and 
6converting a single-party account to a multiple-party account with a financial institution 
7established by Public Law 2017, chapter 390 may result in issues with opening and 
8converting such accounts before the effective date of the new probate code on July 1, 
92019; and
10Whereas, delaying this change will allow financial institutions to offer agency 
11designations allowed by the new probate code and help combat elder financial abuse; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
