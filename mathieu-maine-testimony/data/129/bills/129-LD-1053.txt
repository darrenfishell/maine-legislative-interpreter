17duty or obligations accrued by virtue of such judgment or decree.  This bill provides an

19is irrebuttably presumed to be paid and satisfied at the end of one year after any duty or 
20obligation accrued by virtue of the judgment or decree unless within that period the 
21judgment creditor has commenced other action as permitted by law for the enforcement 
22of the judgment or decree.
