Any additional cost to the Public Utilities Commission as a result of changes to the rules regarding the municipal 
exemption from "make-ready work" fees charged by the owner of a shared-use pole for attachment to, or 
modifications of the arrangement of utilities on, a shared-use pole are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed
