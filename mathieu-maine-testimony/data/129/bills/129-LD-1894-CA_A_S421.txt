Fiscal Note 
Future goals may require funding 
This bill requires the Commissioner of Education to approve the purchase, lease or contracting of school buses to the 
extent practicable in a manner designed to meet a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the public school bus 
fleet by 75% by 2035 and to transition the public school bus fleet to 100% zero emissions by 2045. According to the 
department, school buses that reduce green house gas emissions are more expensive to purchase than the school buses 
that use gas or diesel. To the extent that the commissioner approves the purchase of lower emission or 100% zero­
emission school buses and no additional funds are provided, fewer buses will be approved. To the extent that the 
co1mnissioner does not find it practicable to approve the purchase of lower-e1nission or 100% zero emission school 
buses, the goals specified in the bill may not be met. 
Additional costs to the Department of Transportation, Governor's Energy Office, Efficiency Maine Trust and the 
Public Utilities C01mnission associated with serving on the working group can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
