6SUMMARY
7This bill creates a statutory framework that allows a corporation to elect to become a 
8benefit corporation by explicitly stating in its articles of incorporation that it has a 
9purpose of creating general public benefit and allows such a corporation to state in its 
10articles of incorporation one or more specific public benefit purposes, which are other 
11than maximizing shareholder value.  "General public benefit" means a material positive 
12impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole, assessed against a 3rd-party 
13standard, from the business and operations of the benefit corporation.  A specific public 
14benefit can be providing goods and services to underserved individuals and communities, 
15the promotion of economic opportunities, protecting the environment, improving human 
16health or other particular benefits to society or the environment.
17A benefit corporation may be subject to a benefit enforcement proceeding for failing 
18to pursue or create general public benefit or a specific public benefit as set forth in its 
19articles of incorporation, or for a violation of any obligation, duty or standard of conduct 
20imposed.
21A benefit corporation must make its annual benefit report available publicly.
