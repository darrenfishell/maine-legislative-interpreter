14 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" Pr to H.P. 998, L.D. 1377 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It establishes the Aging and Disability Mortality 
Review Panel to review deaths of and serious injuries to all adults receiving home-based 
and community-based services under a waiver approved by the United States Department 
of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rather than a 
panel to review only deaths of or injuries to adults with intellectual disabilities or autism. 
It removes most of the changes to the Maine Developmental Services Oversight and 
Advisory Board in the bill. It keeps the provisions related to moving the budget of the 
board from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services and related to the disclosure of adult protective 
investigations of individuals with intellectual disabilities or autism to the board. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
