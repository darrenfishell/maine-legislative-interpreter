20 SUMMARY 
21 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, clarifies that the 
22 terms "ballot question committee" and "political action committee," as those terms are 
23 used throughout the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, mean a person required to 
24 register as a ballot question committee or as a political action committee, respectively, in 
25 chapter 13, subchapter 4 of that Title. 
26 The amendment also adds cross-references to the penalty provisions of chapter 13, 
27 subchapter 4 to clarify that, as stated in the bill, those penalties apply to political action 
28 committees or ballot question committees that are required to register and to file 
29 campaign finance reports with a municipal clerk and that violate the campaign finance 
30 laws. Finally, the amendment makes technical changes to the law governing the content 
31 of political action committees' campaign finance reports to clarify that the law does not 
32 apply to ballot question committees.
