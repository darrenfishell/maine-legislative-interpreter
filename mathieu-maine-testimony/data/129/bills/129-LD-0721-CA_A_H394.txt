129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 526, L.D. 721, Bill, "An Act To 
Encourage Public Participation in School Board Meetings" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §1001, sub-§20 is enacted to read: 
20. School board meeting public comment period. A school board shall provide 
the opportunity for the public to comment on school and education matters at a school 
board meeting. Nothing in this subsection restricts the school board from establishing 
reasonable standards for the public comment period, including time limits and conduct 
standards. For purposes of this subsection, "school board meeting" means a full meeting 
of the school board and does not include meetings of subcommittees .1 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the 
provision that a school board must provide the opportunity for the public to comment at 
the beginning of each school board meeting and instead requires that a school board 
provide the opportunity for the public to comment at a school board meeting. A school 
board meeting is defined as a full meeting of the school board that does not include 
meetings of subcommittees.
