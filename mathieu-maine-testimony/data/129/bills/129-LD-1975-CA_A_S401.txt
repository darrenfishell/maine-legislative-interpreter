1 ) 
1 Like the bill, the amendment prohibits a health insurance carrier or dental insurer 
2 from imposing a waiting period for any dental or oral health service or treatment, except 
3 for orthodontic treatment, for an enrollee under 19 years of age. The bill allocates the 
4 prohibition to the Maine Insurance Code, chapter 56-A. The amendment allocates the 
5 prohibition to the appropriate chapters of the Maine Insurance Code to ensure the 
6 prohibition applies to stand-alone dental insurance plans and to health insurance plans 
7 that provide coverage for dental or oral health services. 
8 The amendment makes clear that the provisions apply to policies and contracts issued 
9 or renewed on or after January 1, 2021. 
10 The amendment also corrects a conflict created by Public Law 2019, chapters 274 
11 and 388, which affected the same provision of law.
