35individual and small group health plans offered in this State with effective dates of 
36coverage on or after January 1, 2022 must be offered through a pooled market.  Health 
37insurance carriers offering individual health plans subject to this section shall make the 
38same health plans available to eligible small employers, and health insurance carriers 
39offering small group health plans subject to this section shall make the same health plans 
40available to all residents of this State.  This subsection does not require the Maine Health 
Page 6 - 129LR3131(01)-11Insurance Marketplace established in Title 22, chapter 1479 to offer identical choices of 
2health plans to individuals and to small employers under Title 22, chapter 1479.
32.  Premium rates.  Premium rates for a health plan offered in the pooled market 
4described in subsection 1 may not vary based on whether the plan is issued to an 
5individual or to a small employer.  Rate filings and review for the pooled market are 
6subject to the provisions of sections 2736 to 2736-C.  For health plans that are issued on 
7other than a calendar year basis, rates applicable on and after January 1st of any plan year 
8must be the approved rates for the most similar plan offered during the new calendar year, 
9adjusted by a factor, approved by the superintendent as part of the rating plan, that 
10appropriately accounts for any differences in plan design.
113.  Harmonization of mandated benefit laws.  A health plan subject to this section 
12must comply with either the applicable mandated benefit provisions in chapter 33 or the 
13corresponding provisions of chapter 35.  A health maintenance organization or a 
14nonprofit hospital and medical service organization may offer any health plan approved 
15by the superintendent for sale in the pooled market established pursuant to this section, 
16notwithstanding any provision of chapter 56 or Title 24 to the contrary.

18insurance market, the small group health insurance market or any equivalent terminology

205.  Preconditions for pooled market.  This section may not be implemented unless 
21routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A are adopted to 
22implement this section and the Federal Government approves a state innovation waiver 
23amendment that both extends reinsurance under section 3953 to the pooled market 
24established pursuant to this section and projects that average premium rates would be the 
25same or lower than they would have been absent the provisions of this section.
26§2792.  Clear choice designs
27The superintendent shall develop clear choice designs for the individual and small 
28group health insurance markets in order to reduce consumer confusion and provide 
29meaningful choices for consumers by promoting a level playing field on which carriers 
30compete on the basis of price and quality.
311.  Clear choice design.  For the purposes of this section, "clear choice design" 
32means a set of annual copayments, coinsurance and deductibles for all or a designated 
33subset of the essential health benefits. An individual or small group health plan subject to 
34section 2791 must conform to one of the clear choice designs developed pursuant to this 
35section unless an opt-out request is granted under subsection 4.
362.  Development of clear choice designs.  The superintendent shall develop clear 
37choice designs in consultation with working groups consisting of consumers, carriers, 
38health policy experts and other interested persons. The superintendent shall adopt rules 
39for clear choice designs, taking into consideration the ability of plans to conform to 
40actuarial value ranges, consumer needs and promotion of benefits with high value and 
41return on investment.  There must be at least one clear choice design available at each tier 
Page 7 - 129LR3131(01)-11of health insurance plan designated as bronze, silver, gold and platinum in accordance 
2with the federal Affordable Care Act. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are

4designs apply to all individual and small group health plans offered in this State with 
5effective dates of coverage on or after January 1, 2022.
63.  Annual review.  The superintendent shall consider annually whether to revise, 
7discontinue or add any clear choice designs for use by carriers in the following calendar 
8year, including but not limited to considering whether deductible and copayment levels 
9should be changed to reflect medical inflation and conform with actuarial value and 
10annual maximum out-of-pocket limits.
114.  Opt-out request.  A carrier may offer a health plan that modifies one or more 
12specific cost-sharing parameters in a clear choice design developed pursuant to this 
13section if the carrier requests to opt out of the requirement in subsection 1 and 
14demonstrates to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the alternative plan design 
15offers significant consumer benefits and does not result in adverse selection. If the opt-out 
16request is granted, the carrier may also choose to offer another plan conforming to the 
17original unmodified clear choice design.
18Sec. B-3.  24-A MRSA §2808-B, sub-§2, ¶E, as amended by PL 2019, c. 96, §1,

11A.  Rates subject to this subsection must be filed for approval by the superintendent. 
12The superintendent shall disapprove any premium rates filed by any carrier, whether 
13initial or revised, for a small group health plan unless it is anticipated that the 
14aggregate benefits estimated to be paid under all the small group health plans 
15maintained in force by the carrier for the period for which coverage is to be provided 
16will return to policyholders at least 75% of the aggregate premiums collected for 
17those policies, as determined in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and 
18practices and on the basis of incurred claims experience and earned premiums. For 
19the purposes of this calculation, any payments paid pursuant to former section 6913 
20must be treated as incurred claims.
21B.    If at any time the superintendent has reason to believe that a filing does not meet 
22the requirements that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory or 
23that the filing violates any of the provisions of chapter 23, the superintendent shall 
24cause a hearing to be held.  Hearings held under this subsection must conform to the

32superintendent would approve and authorize the insurer to submit a new filing in 
33accordance with the terms of the order or decision.

35supports the filing or the superintendent does not have sufficient information to 
36determine whether the filing meets the requirements that rates not be excessive, 
37inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, the superintendent shall require the carrier to 
38furnish the information upon which it supports the filing.
39D.  A carrier that adjusts its rate shall account for the savings offset payment or any 
40recovery of that savings offset payment in its experience consistent with this section 
41and former section 6913.

7meets standards for full or partial credibility pursuant to the federal Affordable Care 
8Act. The rate filing must state the anticipated average number of members during the 
9period for which the rates will be in effect and the basis for the estimate.  If the 
10superintendent determines that the number of members is likely to be less than 
11needed to meet the credibility standard, the filing is subject to subsection 2-B.

14plans in this State may not be disqualified for reimbursement on the basis of 
15health conditions, predesignation by the member insurer or any other 
16differentiating factor.

18percentages and make any adjustments that are necessary to ensure that the 
19retrospective reinsurance program operates on an actuarially sound basis.

35that reflects the types of case characteristics used by insurers for individual health plans 
36pursuant to section 2736-C, together with any additional rating factors the association 
37determines to be appropriate.  The methodology must provide for the development of 
38base reinsurance premium rates, subject to approval of the superintendent, set at levels

40anticipated costs of the association.  The association shall periodically review the 
41methodology established under this subsection and may make changes to the 
42methodology as needed with the approval of the superintendent.  The association may 
43consider adjustments to the premium rates charged for reinsurance to reflect the use of
