27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment amends the bill by removing the flavors of menthol, mint and 
29 wintergreen from the list of flavors prohibited in the bill. It makes the definition of 
30 "electronic smoking device" in the bill consistent with the definition of "electronic 
31 smoking device" in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22. 
32 It also provides that it is a Class D crime for a person who is 21 years of age or older 
33 to procure, furnish, give, sell or deliver a tobacco product to a minor or allow a minor 
34 under that person's control or in a place under that person's control to possess or consume 
35 a tobacco product. It is an exception to this provision if the person provides a tobacco 
36 product to a minor in a home in the presence of the minor's parent, guardian or custodian. 
37 This provision does not apply to a licensee under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, 
38 chapter 262-A or agents of that licensee in the scope of employment. Current law 
39 provides that a person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child if the person 
40 knowingly sells, furnishes, gives away or offers to sell, furnish or give away cigarettes to

Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Establishes new Class D crimes 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the comt system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Prohibiting the sale and distribution of certain flavored tobacco products will reduce General Fund revenue by 
$3,094,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $4,125,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
Except for some cigars and electronic smoking devices, the tobacco products that are prohibited by this bill are 
included in the overall revenue that is used in the calculation of the Master Settlement Agreement (Tobacco 
Settlement) payments. Therefore, there would also be a decrease in Fund for a Healthy Maine (FHM) revenue in the 
future. However, it is not known how much of the FHM payment received annually is from the flavored products, so 
no estimate of the revenue decrease is made at this time.
