Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill allows the Department of Inland Fisheries and W ildlife (IFW) to establish bear hunting and trapping seasons 
and bag limits through rulemaking and reduces the fee charged for a resident bear hunting permit from $27 to $10. The fee reduction will result in an annual reduction of Ge neral Fund revenue of $80,750 starting in fiscal year 2021-
22. Any additional costs to IFW as a result of the rulemaki ng process for bear hunting and trapping seasons and bag 
limits are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.  The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time.The collection of additional fine and/or fee revenue w ill increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by minor 
amounts.Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
