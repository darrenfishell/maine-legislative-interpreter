91.  Compelling.  "Compelling" includes but is not limited to:

11controlling that person's conduct or appreciating its nature;
12B.  Withholding or threatening to withhold a scheduled drug or alcohol from a drug-
13dependent or alcohol-dependent person.  "Drug-dependent or alcohol-dependent

15of psychic or physical dependence, or both, arising from the use of the drugs or 
16alcohol on a continuing basis;

21E.  Requiring the sexual exploitation of a person to retire, repay or service an actual 
22or purported debt; and
23F.  Using force or engaging in any scheme, plan or pattern to instill in a person a fear 
24that, if the person does not engage or continue to engage in sexual exploitation, the 
25actor or another person will:
26(1)  Cause physical injury or death to a person;
27(2)  Cause damage to property, other than property of the actor;
28(3)  Engage in other conduct constituting a Class A, Class B or Class C crime or 
29criminal restraint;
30(4)  Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges or deportation 
31proceedings to be instituted against some person;
32(5)  Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, regardless of veracity, tending 
33to subject some person, except the actor, to hatred, contempt or ridicule;

2official duties or fail or refuse to perform an official duty in a manner that 
3adversely affects some other person; or
4(8)  Perform any other act that would not in itself materially benefit the actor but 
5that is calculated to harm the person being compelled with respect to that person's 
6health, safety or immigration status.
72.  Sex trafficking.  "Sex trafficking" means promoting sexual exploitation by 
8compelling a person to enter into, engage in or remain in sexual exploitation, promoting 
9the sexual exploitation of a person less than 18 years of age or promoting the sexual 
10exploitation of a person who suffers from a mental disability that is reasonably apparent 
11or known to the actor and that in fact renders the other person substantially incapable of 
12appraising the nature of the conduct involved.
133.  Sexual exploitation.  "Sexual exploitation" means engaging in the exchange of 
14sex for money or resources because of a person's history of trauma, adverse childhood 
15experiences, substance use disorder or other circumstances of victimhood, exploitation or 
16oppression.
17ยง2192.  Post-judgment motion for vacating and correcting record
181.  Motion; persons who may file.  A person for whom one or more criminal 
19convictions in which a final judgment has been entered were the result of the person's 
20sexual exploitation or being subjected to sex trafficking may file a written motion in the 
21underlying criminal proceeding seeking to vacate the conviction and to correct the court 
22records and related criminal justice agency records.  The same motion may also be filed 
23on behalf of such a person by an attorney for the State or by the court.
242.  Timing for filing.  A motion under this section to vacate and correct the record 
25must be filed with due diligence, after the person moving for relief has ceased to be a 
26victim of sexual exploitation or sex trafficking or has sought services for victims of 
27sexual exploitation or sex trafficking, subject to reasonable concerns for the safety of the 
28person moving for relief, family members of the person or other victims of sexual 
29exploitation or sex trafficking who may be jeopardized by the bringing of such a motion 
30or for other reasons consistent with the purpose of this subsection.
31ยง2193.  Motion and hearing; process
321.  Filing motion.  A motion filed under section 2192 must be filed in the underlying 
33criminal proceeding.  The appropriate chief judge or justice shall specially assign the 
34motion.  The judge or justice to whom the motion is assigned shall determine upon whom 
35and how service of the motion is to be made and enter an order in this regard.
362.  Counsel.  If the court finds that the person who files the motion under section 
372192 or on whose behalf the motion is filed is indigent, the court may appoint counsel for 
38the person at any time during the proceedings.
Page 3 - 129LR0703(01)-113.  Representation of the State.  The prosecutorial office that represented the State 
2in the underlying criminal proceeding shall represent the State for purposes of this 
3chapter.
44.  Evidence.  The Maine Rules of Evidence do not apply to the hearing on the 
5motion filed under section 2192, and evidence presented at the hearing by the participants 
6may include testimony, affidavits and other reliable hearsay evidence as permitted by the 
7court.  Official documentation of a person's status as a victim of sexual exploitation or sex 
8trafficking creates a presumption that the person's participation in an offense was a result 
9of the person's having been a victim of sexual exploitation or sex trafficking but is not 
10required for granting a petition.
115.  Hearing; certification of results.  The judge or justice to whom the motion is 
12assigned pursuant to subsection 1 shall hold a hearing on the motion.  At the conclusion 
13of the hearing, if the court finds that the person who filed the motion has established by a 
14preponderance of the evidence that the person has experienced sexual exploitation and 
15that the sexual exploitation resulted in the commission of the criminal act the conviction 
16for which the person seeks to vacate, the court shall issue a written order vacating the 
17conviction and may take such additional action as the court determines appropriate in the 
18circumstances. A copy of the court's written order granting or denying the motion must be 
19provided to the person.
206.  Correction of the record.  If the court grants the motion following the hearing in 
21subsection 5, it shall additionally determine what court records and related criminal 
22justice records require correction and shall enter a written order specifying the corrections 
23to be made in the court records and the records of each of the appropriate criminal justice 
24agencies.
25ยง2194.  Review of order on motion to vacate
26A final judgment entered under section 2193 may be reviewed by the Supreme 
27Judicial Court sitting as the Law Court.
28A person aggrieved by the final judgment under section 2193 may appeal as of right.  
29The time for taking the appeal and the manner and any conditions for the taking of the 
30appeal are as the Supreme Judicial Court provides by rule.
31SUMMARY
32This bill provides for a comprehensive post-judgment method of relief for a person 
33for whom one or more criminal convictions in which a final judgment has been entered 
34were the result of the person's sexual exploitation or being subjected to sex trafficking.  
35This method of relief is similar to that provided in law to a person whose identity has 
36been stolen and falsely used by another person in a criminal, civil violation or traffic 
37infraction proceeding.  The relief offered is the court's vacating the conviction and the 
38correction of the court records and related criminal justice agency records.
