Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Limiting the total enrollment at all authorized vitiual public charter schools to 1,200 students will not affect the total 
cost of public education from kindergarten to grade 12 or the State's share of that cost. Additionally, this legislation 
will not impact the distribution of state subsidy to local school administrative units and public chmier schools until thf 
enrollment cap is reached and only if the student who would have enrolled in a virtual charter school if the cap had 
not been in place opts to enroll in a public high school instead of another charter school. CmTently there are 
approximately 800 students enrolled at authorized virtual public charter schools in the State.
