STATE OF MAINE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 700, L.D. 945, Bill, "An Act To 
Establish a Blue Ribbon Commission To Study and Recommend Funding Solutions for 
the State's Transportation Systems" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Establish the Blue Ribbon Commission To Study and Recommend 
Funding Solutions for the State's Transportation Systems' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, this legislation establishes the Blue Ribbon Commission To Study and 
Recommend Funding Solutions for the State's Transportation Systems; and 
Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that 
the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
legislative session; and 
Whereas, adequate, sustainable and predictable transportation funding is critical to 
the safety and economic well-being of all the State's citizens; and 
Whereas, funding for transportation infrastructure in the State and the nation is 
seriously lacking; and 
Whereas, the shortfall in funding related to the State's state highway and bridge 
system is at least $160 million per year, without consideration of general obligation 
bonding; and 
Whereas, general obligation bonding levels are unpredictable due to the current 
short-term focus of the process that determines bonding levels and priorities, a process 
that usually takes place late in a legislative session after finalization of the biennial 
budget, if at all; and 
Page 1 -129LR1973(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 700, L.D. 945 
1 Whereas, higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles continue to 
2 erode the funding provided by per gallon fuel taxes and increases the inequity between 
3 drivers in terms of the fee paid per mile for use of the state highway and bridge system; 
4 and 
5 Whereas, fuel prices are relatively low but will likely rise in the years ahead; and 
6 Whereas, about 37 million people visit the State each year, which has a year-round 
7 population of about 1.3 million people, and the capacity and a significant portion of the 
8 cost of the State's transportation systems are driven by seasonal traffic volumes that swell 
9 due to our valued visitors from away; and 
10 Whereas, through years of capital planning, prioritization and efficiency initiatives, 
11 the Department of Transportation has proven that it uses funding efficiently and 
12 effectively and can be trusted to do so with additional funding; and 
13 Whereas, federal transportation funding is unpredictable, the federal Fixing 
14 America's Surface Transportation Act will expire in 2020 and there is no guarantee, in 
15 this federal environment, of a stable funding solution in the future; and 
16 Whereas, other states are finding transportation funding solutions, the State has an 
17 obligation to all the State's citizens to seek funding solutions now; and 
18 Whereas, a bipartisan blue ribbon commission charged with analyzing options and 
19 recommending legislation is the best way to reform and supplement transportation 
20 funding in Maine; and 
21 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
22 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
23 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
24 therefore, be it 
25 Sec. 1. Commission established. Resolved: That the Blue Ribbon 
26 Commission To Study and Recommend Funding Solutions for the State's Transportation 
27 Systems, referred to in this resolve as "the commission," is established. 
28 Sec. 2. Commission membership. Resolved: That, notwithstanding Joint 
29 Rule 353, the commission consists of 15 members as follows:

33 Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs or the Joint Standing Committee on 
34 Taxation; 
35 2. One member appointed by the President of the Senate representing an 
36 organization of municipal or public works officials; 
37 3. Four members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, at least 
38 one of whom is from the minority party in the House, including at least one member of 
39 the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation, and at least one member of either the 
40 Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs or the Joint Standing 
41 Committee on Taxation;
