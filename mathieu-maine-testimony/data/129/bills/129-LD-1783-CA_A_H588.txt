Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium revenue increase -Highway Fund 
Future biennium revenue decrease -Highway Fund 
Lowering from 30,000 to 20,000 the minimum number of semitrailer registrations per owner or company required to 
qualify for 25-year permanent registrations would increase the number of permanent registrations issued in the first 
year or two after implementation and increase Highway Fund revenue in those years. Future revenue would be 
reduced as fewer registrations would need to be renewed until 25 years later. It is not known how many companies 
would take advantage of this provision and no revenue estimate is made. Additional costs to the Department of 
Secretaiy of State associated with this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
