7 of the analysis.
8 Sec. 2.  29-A MRSA §2431, sub-§2, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 459, §3, is 
9 further amended to read:
10 C.  A certificate issued in accordance with paragraph A or B, when duly signed and 
11 sworn, is prima facie evidence that:
12 (1)  The person taking the specimen was authorized to do so;
13 (2)  Materials used in the taking of the specimen were of a quality appropriate for 
14 the purpose of producing reliable test results as determined by the Department of 
15 Health and Human Services;
16 (3)  Materials required to be approved by the Department of Health and Human 
17 Services were in fact approved;
18 (4)  The sample tested was in fact the same sample taken from the defendant; and
19 (5)  The alcohol level or the presence of a drug or drug metabolite in the blood or 
20 urine of the defendant at the time the sample was taken was as stated in the 
21 certificate.
22 Sec. 3.  29-A MRSA §2524, sub-§1-A is enacted to read:
23 1-A.  Liability.  A physician, physician's assistant, registered nurse, person whose 
24 occupational license or training allows that person to draw blood, hospital or other health 
25 care provider in the exercise of due care is not liable for an act done or omitted in 
26 collecting or withdrawing specimens of blood at the request of a law enforcement officer 
27 pursuant to this chapter.
28 Sec. 4.  29-A MRSA §2524, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 459, §11, is 
29 further amended to read:
30 2. Laboratories qualified to analyze blood for blood tests.  A person laboratory
31 conducting an analysis of blood-alcohol level or the presence of a drug or drug metabolite 
32 must either be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services or be licensed 
33 to do so under the laws of this State or any other state and also certified by the United 
34 States Department of Health and Human Services under the federal Clinical Laboratory 
35 Improvement Amendments of 1988, 42 United States Code, Section 263a (2018).
36 Sec. 5.  29-A MRSA §2524, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2013, c. 459, §11, is 
37 further amended to read:
Page 2 - 129LR2343(01)-11 4. Chemical tests on blood and urine specimens.  A sample specimen of blood or
2 urine may be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services or to a person

10 may be used to take a sample specimen of blood or urine, except that.  A sample 
11 specimen of blood or urine may also be taken in any collection tube of the type normally 
12 used in a laboratory qualified pursuant to subsection 2.  The fact that a laboratory 
13 qualified pursuant to subsection 2 supplied the collection tube is prima facie evidence that 
14 the collection tube is the type of tube normally used in such a laboratory.  Alternatively, a 
15 self-contained, breath-alcohol testing apparatus if reasonably available may be used to 
16 determine the alcohol level.
17 Approved breath-alcohol testing apparatus must have a stamp of approval affixed by the 
18 Department of Health and Human Services after periodic testing.  That stamp is valid for 
19 no more than one year.

25 testing of testing apparatus used in laboratories certified by the Department of Health and 
26 Human Services.
27 Sec. 8.  29-A MRSA §2528, as amended by PL 2013, c. 459, §12, is repealed.
