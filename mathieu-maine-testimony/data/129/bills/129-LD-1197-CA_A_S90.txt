9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/Ir" to S.P. 372, L.D. 1197, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend the Law Prohibiting the Denial by Health Insurers of Referrals by Out-of-network 
11 Providers" 
12 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA ยง4303, sub-ยง22, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, ยง7, is 
14 amended to read: 
15 22. Denial of referral by out-of-network provider prohibited. Beginning January 
16 1, 2018, a carrier may not deny payment for any health care service covered under an 
17 enrollee's health plan based solely on the basis that the enrollee's referral was made by a 
18 direct primary care provider who is not a member of the carrier's provider network. A 
19 carrier may not apply a deductible, coinsurance or copayment greater than the applicable 
20 deductible, coinsurance or copayment that would apply to the same health care service if 
21 the service was referred by a participating primary care provider. A carrier may require a 
22 direct primary care provider making a referral who is not a member of the carrier's 
23 provider network to provide information demonstrating that the provider is a direct 
24 primary care provider through a written attestation or copy of a direct primary care 
25 agreement with an enrollee and may request additional information necessary to 
26 implement this subsection. As used in this subsection, "direct primary care provider" has 
27 the same meaning as in Title 22, section 1771, subsection 1, paragraph B.' 
28 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
29 section number to read consecutively. 
30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment provides that the law that 
32 prohibits carriers from denying payment for covered health care services solely on the 
33 basis that the referral for services was made by an out-of-network provider applies only to 
34 referrals made by out-of-network direct primary care providers. It prohibits a carrier 
35 from requiring an enrollee to pay a greater cost-sharing amount than the cost-sharing that

1 would apply to the same service if the service was referred by a participating primary 
2 care provider. It also allows a carrier to require a direct primary care provider who is not 
3 a member of the carrier's provider network to attest that the provider is a direct primary 
4 care provider through a written attestation or copy of the direct primary care agreement 
5 with the enrollee.
