Committee: Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Increased maximum loan amount -Maine Dental Education Loan Program 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Increasing the maximum amount a loan recipient may receive from the Maine Dental Education Loan Program from 
$20,000 per year for up to 4 years to $25,000 per yemÂ· for up to 4 years is not expected to impact the total number of 
loans issued by the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) through the 2020-2021 biennium. The loan pro gram 
currently receives $23 7, 7 40 per year in funding from the Fund for a Healthy Maine. LD 1001, the 2020-2021 biennial 
budget proposes to continue that funding through the biennium. FAME anticipates that sufficient funding will be 
available to support the increase in the loan amount without affecting the number of loans issued each year unless the 
annual allocation from the Fund for a Healthy Maine is reduced or eliminated.
