13SUMMARY
14Current law provides that "wrecker" does not include a vehicle designed to carry or 
15tow more than 2 vehicles on its own body.  This bill strikes that language and provides 
16that a wrecker may not carry or tow more vehicles than allowed by the manufacturer 
17specifications for that wrecker.
