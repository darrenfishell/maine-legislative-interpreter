22Sec. 5.  39-A MRSA §213, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 297, §8, is further 
23amended to read:
241.  Benefit and duration.  While the incapacity for work is partial, the employer 
25shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation as follows.
26A.  If the injured employee's date of injury is prior to January 1, 2013, the weekly 
27compensation is equal to 80% of the difference between the injured employee's after-
28tax average weekly wage before the personal injury and the after-tax average weekly 
29wage that the injured employee is able to earn after the injury, but not more than the 
30maximum benefit under section 211.  Compensation must be paid for the duration of 
31the disability if the employee's permanent impairment, determined according to 
32subsection 1-A and the impairment guidelines adopted by the board pursuant to 
33section 153, subsection 8, resulting from the personal injury is in excess of 15% to 
34the body.  In all other cases an employee is not eligible to receive compensation 
35under this paragraph after the employee has received a total of 260 weeks of 
36compensation under section 212, subsection 1, this paragraph or both.  The board 
37may in the exercise of its discretion extend the duration of benefit entitlement beyond 
38260 weeks in cases involving extreme financial hardship due to inability to return to 
39gainful employment.  This authority may be delegated by the board, on a case-by-
40case basis, to an administrative law judge or a panel of 3 administrative law judges.  
41Decisions made under this paragraph must be made expeditiously.  A decision under 
42this paragraph made by an administrative law judge or a panel of 3 administrative law 
Page 3 - 129LR2055(01)-11judges may not be appealed to the board under section 320, but may be appealed 
2pursuant to section 322.
3B.  If the injured employee's date of injury is on or after January 1, 2013, the weekly 
4compensation is equal to 2/3 of the difference, due to the injury, between the 
5employee's average gross weekly wages, earnings or salary before the injury and the 
6average gross weekly wages, earnings or salary that the employee is able to earn after 
7the injury, but not more than the maximum benefit under section 211.  An employee 
8is not eligible to receive compensation under this paragraph after the employee has 
9received a total of 520 weeks of compensation under section 212, subsection 1-A, this 
10paragraph or both.  The board may in the exercise of its discretion extend the duration 
11of benefit entitlement beyond 520 weeks in cases involving extreme financial 
12hardship due to inability to return to gainful employment.  This authority may be 
13delegated by the board, on a case-by-case basis, to an administrative law judge or a 
14panel of 3 administrative law judges.  The board, administrative law judge or panel 
15shall make a decision under this paragraph expeditiously.  A decision under this 
16paragraph made by an administrative law judge or a panel of 3 administrative law 
17judges may not be appealed to the board under section 320, but may be appealed 
18pursuant to section 321-A.
19Orders extending benefits beyond 520 weeks are not subject to review more often 
20than every 2 years from the date of the board order or request allowing an extension.
21Sec. 6.  39-A MRSA §213, sub-§1-B, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 647, §8, is 
22amended to read:
231-B.  Long-term partial incapacity; date of injury on or after January 1, 2013.  
24After the exhaustion of benefits under subsection 1, paragraph B if the whole person 
25permanent impairment resulting from the injury is in excess of 18% and if the employee 
26is working and the employee's earnings, as measured by average weekly earnings over the 
27most recent 26-week period documented by payroll records or tax returns, is 65% or less 
28of the preinjury average weekly wage, the employer shall pay weekly compensation equal 
29to 2/3 of the difference between the employee's average weekly wage at the time of the 
30injury and the employee's postinjury wage, but not more than the maximum benefit under 
31section 211.  In order for the employee to qualify for benefits under this subsection, the 
32employee's actual earnings must be commensurate with the employee's earning capacity, 
33which includes consideration of the employee's physical and psychological work capacity 
34as determined by an independent examiner under section 312.  In addition, in order for 
35the employee to qualify for benefits under this subsection, the employee must have 
36earnings from employment for a period of not less than 12 months within a 24-month 
37period prior to the expiration of the 520-week durational limit under subsection 1, 
38paragraph B.  Compensation under this subsection must be paid at a fixed rate.
39While the employee is claiming or receiving extended partial incapacity benefits under 
40this subsection, the employee shall complete and provide quarterly employment status 
41reports and provide copies of current tax returns as early as practicable after the return is 
42filed.
43The employee's entitlement to extended partial incapacity benefits under this subsection 
44is determined based upon the facts that exist at the time of expiration of 520 weeks of 
Page 4 - 129LR2055(01)-11benefits under subsection 1, paragraph B.  If the employee is not entitled to extended 
2partial incapacity benefits upon the expiration of 520 weeks of benefits under subsection 
31, paragraph B, the employee's entitlement to partial incapacity benefits expires.  If the 
4employee is entitled to extended partial incapacity benefits under this subsection, once 
5the employee's earnings, as measured by average weekly earnings over the most recent 
626-week period, are equal to or greater than the preinjury average weekly wage, the 
7employee's entitlement to extended partial incapacity benefits under this subsection 
8terminates permanently.
9Sec. 7.  39-A MRSA §214, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2011, c. 647, §10, is 
10further amended to read:
11B.  If an injured employee's date of injury is prior to January 1, 2013 and the 
12employee is employed at any job and the average weekly wage of the employee is 
13less than that which the employee received before the date of injury, the employee is 
14entitled to receive weekly benefits under this Act equal to 80% of the difference 
15between the injured employee's after-tax weekly wage before the date of injury and 
16the after-tax weekly wage that the injured employee is able to earn after the date of 
17injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate of compensation, as determined 
18under section 211.
19Sec. 8.  39-A MRSA §214, sub-§1, ¶B-1, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 647, §11, is 
20amended to read:
21B-1.  If an injured employee's date of injury is on or after January 1, 2013 and the 
22employee is employed at any job and the average weekly wage of the employee is 
23less than that which the employee received before the date of injury, the employee is 
24entitled to receive weekly benefits under this Act equal to 2/3 of the difference, due 
25to the injury, between the employee's average gross weekly wages, earnings or salary 
26before the injury and the average gross weekly wages, earnings or salary that the 
27employee is able to earn after the injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate 
28of compensation, as determined under section 211.
29Sec. 9.  39-A MRSA §215, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 647, §12, is 
30further amended to read:
311.  Death of employee; date of injury prior to January 1, 2013.  If an injured 
32employee's date of injury is prior to January 1, 2013 and if death results from the injury of 
33the employee, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the dependents of the 
34employee who were wholly dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the 
35time of the injury a weekly payment equal to 80% of the employee's after-tax average 
36weekly wage, but not more than the maximum benefit under section 211, for a period of 
37500 weeks from the date of death. If the employee leaves dependents only partially 
38dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the time of injury, the employer 
39shall pay weekly compensation equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for 
40the benefit of persons wholly dependent, as 80% of the amount contributed by the 
41employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the 
42time of injury.  If, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially 
Page 5 - 129LR2055(01)-11dependent person is less than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause 
2to be paid the weekly compensation until that person reaches the age of 18.
3If a dependent spouse dies or becomes a dependent of another person, the payments must 
4cease upon the payment to the spouse of the balance of the compensation to which the 
5spouse would otherwise have been entitled but in no event to exceed the sum of $500.00.  
6The remaining weeks of compensation, if any, are payable to those persons either wholly 
7or partially dependent upon the employee for support at the employee's death.  When, at 
8the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially dependent person is less 
9than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause to be paid the weekly 
10compensation, until that person reaches the age of 18.  The payment of compensation to 
11any dependent child after the expiration of the 500-week period ceases when the child 
12reaches the age of 18 years, if at the age of 18 years the child is neither physically nor 
13mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child reaches the age of 16 years and 
14thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months. If the child ceases to be self-supporting 
15thereafter, the dependency must be reinstated.  As long as any of the 500 weeks of 
16compensation remain, that compensation is payable to the person either wholly or 
17partially dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time of the employee's 
18death, with the exception of a dependent spouse who becomes a dependent of another.  If 
19a wholly dependent or partially dependent child who reaches 18 years of age is either 
20physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be unable to earn a living as determined by 
21the board, the payments must continue until such time as the child either dies or is no 
22longer physically or mentally incapacitated from earning.
23Sec. 10.  39-A MRSA §215, sub-§1-A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 647, §13, is 
24amended to read:
251-A.  Death of employee; date of injury on or after January 1, 2013.  If an injured 
26employee's date of injury is on or after January 1, 2013 and if death results from the 
27injury of the employee, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the dependents of 
28the employee who were wholly dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at 
29the time of the injury a weekly payment equal to 2/3 of the employee's gross average 
30weekly wages, earnings or salary, but not more than the maximum benefit under section 
31211, for a period of 500 weeks from the date of death.  If the employee leaves dependents 
32only partially dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the time of injury, 
33the employer shall pay weekly compensation equal to the same proportion of the weekly 
34payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent, as 2/3 of the amount contributed 
35by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased 
36at the time of injury.  If, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially 
37dependent person is less than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause 
38to be paid the weekly compensation until that person reaches the age of 18.
39If a dependent spouse dies or becomes a dependent of another person, the payments must 
40cease upon the payment to the spouse of the balance of the compensation to which the 
41spouse would otherwise have been entitled but in no event to exceed the sum of $500.00.  
42The remaining weeks of compensation, if any, are payable to those persons either wholly 
43or partially dependent upon the employee for support at the employee's death.  When, at 
44the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially dependent person is less 
45than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause to be paid the weekly 
Page 6 - 129LR2055(01)-11compensation, until that person reaches the age of 18.  The payment of compensation to 
2any dependent child after the expiration of the 500-week period ceases when the child 
3reaches the age of 18 years, if at the age of 18 years the child is neither physically nor 
4mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child reaches the age of 16 years and 
5thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months. If the child ceases to be self-supporting 
6thereafter, the dependency must be reinstated.  As long as any of the 500 weeks of 
7compensation remain, that compensation is payable to the person either wholly or 
8partially dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time of the employee's 
9death, with the exception of a dependent spouse who becomes a dependent of another.  If 
10a wholly dependent or partially dependent child who reaches 18 years of age is either 
11physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be unable to earn a living as determined by 
12the board, the payments must continue until such time as the child either dies or is no 
13longer physically or mentally incapacitated from earning.
14SUMMARY
15Current law caps the weekly benefit payable under the laws governing workers' 
16compensation to a maximum amount set in statute or a percentage of the state average 
17weekly wage, whichever is higher.  This bill eliminates the cap on the weekly benefits.
