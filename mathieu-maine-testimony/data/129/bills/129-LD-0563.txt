17a coastal municipality, if the municipality or region adopts a growth management 
18program under the State's growth planning and land use laws, may include in its 
19comprehensive plan projections regarding sea level changes and the potential effects of 
20the rise in sea level and may develop a coordinated plan for addressing the effects of the 
21rise in sea level.  The bill also provides that "coastal municipality" means a municipality 
22or township in the coastal zone as identified by a coastal program administered by the 
23Department of Marine Resources.
