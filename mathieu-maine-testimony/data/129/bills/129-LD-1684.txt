13D.  Juvenile Courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over proceedings in 
14which an adult is alleged to have committed a juvenile crime after having attained 12

22Sec. 2.  15 MRSA §3306, sub-§1, as amended by PL 1977, c. 664, §25, is 
23repealed and the following enacted in its place:
241.  Notice and appointment of counsel.  The provisions of this subsection govern a 
25juvenile's right to counsel.
26A.  At a juvenile's first appearance before the court, the court shall fully advise the 
27juvenile and the parents, guardian or legal custodian of the juvenile of their 
28constitutional and legal rights, including the juvenile's right to be represented by 
29counsel at every stage of the proceedings.  At every subsequent appearance before the 
30court, the court shall fully advise the juvenile of the juvenile's right to be represented 
31by counsel.
32B.  If the juvenile requests an attorney and the juvenile and the juvenile's parents, 
33guardian or legal custodian are found to be without sufficient financial means, the 
34court shall appoint counsel for the juvenile pursuant to the Maine Rules of Unified 
35Criminal Procedure, Rule 44.
36C.  The court, at any stage of the proceedings, may appoint counsel without being

7until the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile has ended:
8(1)  Detention, adjudicatory and dispositional hearings; and
9(2)  Post-dispositional proceedings, including appeal, post-conviction review and 
10judicial review of commitment.
11Sec. 3.  15 MRSA §3313, as amended by PL 1995, c. 690, §5, is further amended 
12to read:
13§3313.  Mandatory criteria for imposing an institutional disposition
141.  Standard.  The court may not issue an order of disposition that involves 
15commitment for any juvenile who has not attained 14 years of age.  The court may not 
16issue an order of disposition that involves commitment for a juvenile who has attained 14 
17years of age who has been adjudicated of a juvenile crime that would constitute a Class D 
18or Class E crime unless, based upon both the written agreement of the parties and a court 
19finding, the facts and circumstances of the underlying criminal episode giving rise to the 
20Class D or Class E adjudication generated probable cause to believe the juvenile had 
21committed a juvenile crime that would constitute a Class A, Class B or Class C crime in 
22the course of that criminal episode.  The court shall may not enter an order of disposition 
23for a juvenile who has attained 14 years of age and who has been adjudicated as having 
24committed a juvenile crime without by imposing placement in a secure institution as 
25disposition unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and the 
26history, character and condition of the juvenile, it finds the State provides and the court 
27finds by clear and convincing evidence that his the juvenile's confinement is necessary for 
28protection of the public because: 
29A.  There is undue demonstrable risk that, during the period of a suspended sentence 
30or probation, the juvenile will commit another crime;
31B.  The juvenile is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most 
32effectively only by his commitment to an a secure institution; or
33C.  A lesser sentence disposition that does not involve commitment to a secure 
34institution will depreciate the seriousness of the juvenile's conduct.
352.  Additional consideration.  The court shall explicitly, on the record and in open 
36court, weigh the following grounds, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall 
37be accorded weight against ordering placement in a secure institution: 
38A.  The juvenile's conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm;
39B.  The juvenile did not contemplate or was incapable of contemplating that his the 
40juvenile's conduct would cause or threaten serious harm;
Page 3 - 129LR1572(01)-11C.  The juvenile acted under a strong provocation;
2D.  There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the juvenile's conduct, 
3though failing to establish a defense;
4E.  The victim of the juvenile's conduct induced or facilitated its commission;
5F.  The juvenile has made or has agreed to make restitution to the victim of his 
6conduct for the damage or injury that the victim sustained;
7G.  The juvenile has not previously been adjudicated to have committed a juvenile 
8crime or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time prior to the conduct 
9which that formed the basis for the present adjudication;
10H.  The juvenile's conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;
11I.  The character and attitudes of the juvenile indicate that he the juvenile is unlikely 
12to commit another juvenile crime;
13J.  The juvenile is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probation; and
14K.  The confinement of the juvenile would entail excessive hardship to himself the 
15juvenile or his the juvenile's dependents.; and
16L.  Secure confinement in a juvenile facility demonstrably risks harm to the juvenile 
17because of:
18(1)  Conditions at the facility with respect to the juvenile's safety, health and 
19welfare;
20(2)  Inability of the facility to timely provide all medically necessary and 
21rehabilitative medical and mental health care to the juvenile;
22(3)  Inability of the facility to provide the education to which the juvenile is 
23entitled, including under an individualized education plan pursuant to Title 20-A, 
24chapter 303; or
25(4)  Any other reason related to the juvenile's best interests.
263.  Statement of reasons accompanying disposition of commitment for juveniles.  
27In a disposition for a juvenile crime that if committed by an adult would be murder or a 
28Class A, Class B or Class C crime, the court shall state on the record and in open court 
29the court's reasons for ordering or not ordering placement of the juvenile in a secure 
30institution.  Failure to state these reasons, even if a disposition that includes commitment 
31is agreed to by the juvenile and the State, is grounds for appeal as a per se abuse of 
32discretion as an indication that the court has not weighed independently the propriety of 
33imposing a disposition that involves any period of commitment to a secure institution.
34Sec. 4.  15 MRSA §3314, sub-§1, ¶F, as amended by PL 2001, c. 696, §4, is 
35further amended to read:
36F.  The If the juvenile has attained 14 years of age, the court may commit the juvenile 
37to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility.  Whenever a juvenile is 
38committed to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility, the court 
39shall determine whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate 
Page 4 - 129LR1572(01)-11the need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no reasonable 
2efforts are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as defined in 
3Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1-B, and whether continuation in the juvenile's 
4home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  This determination does not 
5affect whether the court orders a commitment to a Department of Corrections 
6juvenile correctional facility, which continues to be governed by section 3313.
7Sec. 5.  15 MRSA §3314, sub-§1, ¶H, as amended by PL 2007, c. 96, §5, is 
8further amended to read:
9H.  The If the juvenile has attained 14 years of age, the court may order the juvenile 
10to serve a period of confinement that may not exceed 30 days, with or without an 
11underlying suspended disposition of commitment to a Department of Corrections 
12juvenile correctional facility, which confinement must be served concurrently with 
13any other period of confinement previously imposed and not fully discharged or 
14imposed on the same date but may be served intermittently as the court may order 
15and must be ordered served in a facility approved or operated by the Department of 
16Corrections exclusively for juveniles.  The court may order such a disposition to be 
17served as a part of and with a period of probation that is subject to such provisions of 
18Title 17-A, section 1204 as the court may order and that must be administered 
19pursuant to Title 34-A, chapter 5, subchapter 4.  Revocation of probation is governed 
20by the procedure contained in subsection 2.  Any disposition under this paragraph is 
21subject to Title 17-A, section 1253, subsection 2 except that a statement is not 
22required to be furnished and the day-for-day deduction must be determined by the 
23facility, but not to Title 17-A, section 1253, subsection 2, paragraph A, or subsection 
243-B, 4, 5, 8, 9 or 10.  For purposes of calculating the commencement of the period of 
25confinement, credit is accorded only for the portion of the first day for which the 
26juvenile is actually confined; the juvenile may not be released until the juvenile has 
27served the full term of hours or days imposed by the court.  When a juvenile is 
28committed for a period of confinement, the court shall determine whether reasonable 
29efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the juvenile 
30from the juvenile's home or that reasonable efforts are not necessary because of the 
31existence of an aggravating factor as defined in Title 22, section 4002, subsection 1-B 
32and whether continuation in the juvenile's home would be contrary to the welfare of 
33the juvenile.  This determination does not affect whether the court orders a period of 
34confinement pursuant to section 3313.
35Sec. 6.  15 MRSA §3315, as amended by PL 2013, c. 234, §10, is further amended 
36to read:
37§3315.  Right to periodic review
381.  Right to review for dispositions that do not involve commitment.  Every 
39disposition pursuant to section 3314 and or 3318-B, other than unconditional discharge or 
40commitment or possible commitment to a secure institution, must be reviewed not less 
41than once in every 12 6 months until the juvenile is discharged or has attained 21 years of 
42age, whichever occurs earlier. The review must be made by a representative of the 
43Department of Corrections unless the juvenile has been committed to the custody of the 
44Commissioner of Health and Human Services, in which case such review must be made 
Page 5 - 129LR1572(01)-11by a representative of the Department of Health and Human Services. A report of the 
2review must be made in writing to the juvenile and the juvenile's parents, guardian or 
3legal custodian. A copy of the report must be forwarded to the program or programs that 
4were reviewed, and the department whose personnel made the review shall retain a copy 
5of the report in their files. The written report must be prepared in accordance with 
6subsection 2.  When a juvenile is placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Health 
7and Human Services, reviews and permanency planning hearings must be conducted in 
8accordance with Title 22, section 4038.  Title 22, sections 4005, 4039 and 4041 also 
9apply.
101-A.  Judicial review of juvenile in custody of Department of Corrections.  When 
11a juvenile is placed in the custody of the Department of Corrections, the court shall grant 
12a petition for review filed by the juvenile, the parents, guardian or legal custodian of the 
13juvenile or the department; the court may also initiate a review on its own.  Prior to the 
14review, the department shall provide notice of the review to the court and to the juvenile 
15and the juvenile's parents, guardian or legal custodian but not to a parent whose parental 
16rights have been terminated pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1071, subchapter 6.
17The court may convene a prehearing conference to clarify any disputed issues and to 
18review the possibility of a less restrictive alternative to incarceration.  The court shall 
19consider the report made by the department in accordance with subsection 1, hear 
20evidence and consider the reason for the original disposition made under sections 3313 
21and 3314 and efforts made by the parties since then.
22After a hearing or by agreement, the court shall make written findings that determine:
23A.  The safety of the juvenile's placement;
24B.  The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the juvenile's placement;
25C.  The extent of the involved parties' compliance with the juvenile's individualized 
26plan and the extent of the juvenile's progress with that plan;
27D.  A likely date when the juvenile may be placed in a less restrictive alternative or at 
28home; and
29E.  If the juvenile is at least 16 years of age, whether that juvenile is receiving 
30instructions to aid that juvenile to live independently.
31The court may make any other order it is authorized to make pursuant to section 3314.
322.  Contents of review. The written report of each periodic review shall must contain 
33the following information:
34A.  A brief description of the services, with the dates and types of service for each 
35provider, provided to the juvenile during the period preceding the review and the 
36results of those services;
37B.  An The current well-being of the juvenile and an individualized plan for the 
38provision of services to the juvenile for the next period;
39C.  A statement showing that the plan imposes the least restricting restrictive 
40alternative consistent with adequate care of the juvenile and protection of the 
Page 6 - 129LR1572(01)-11community, including a statement specifying which less restrictive alternatives were 
2considered and at what time and the reasons why those alternatives were rejected; and
3D.  A certification that the services recommended are available and will be afforded 
4to the juvenile.
53.  Court review of determination to remove juvenile from home.  Whenever a 
6court makes a determination pursuant to section 3314, subsection 1, paragraph F or 
7section 3314, subsection 2 that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate 
8the need for removal of the juvenile from the juvenile's home or that no reasonable efforts 
9are necessary because of the existence of an aggravating factor as defined in Title 22, 
10section 4002, subsection 1-B and that continuation in the juvenile's home would be 
11contrary to the welfare of the juvenile, that determination must be reviewed by the court 
12not less than once every 12 months until the juvenile is discharged or no longer residing 
13outside the juvenile's home or attains 18 years of age.  This review does not affect a 
14juvenile's commitment to a Department of Corrections juvenile correctional facility 
15pursuant to section 3313.
164.  Court review of determination to impose a disposition involving commitment.  
17Whenever a court imposes a disposition that involves commitment to a secure institution 
18for a juvenile pursuant to section 3314, subsection 1, paragraph F, or a suspended 
19sentence and an order of probation that could result in a disposition of commitment to a 
20secure institution pursuant to section 3314, subsection 2, no later than 90 days following 
21the imposition of the disposition, and at least every 90 days thereafter, the juvenile must 
22appear before the court with the juvenile's parents, guardian or legal custodian to review 
23the disposition.  The Department of Corrections shall provide notice of the reviews and 
24file a copy of each notice with the court prior to the review hearing. The court may 
25convene a prehearing conference to clarify the disputed issues and review the possibility 
26of alternative dispositions specified in section 3314.  The court shall determine, in light of 
27the factors set forth in subsections 1-A and 2, section 3002 and section 3313, whether 
28further confinement in a secure institution demonstrably risks harm to the juvenile. The 
29State and any witnesses considered necessary by the State, the juvenile or the court shall 
30appear before the court in order for the court to review whether further commitment of 
31the juvenile is in the juvenile's best interests.  The court may also receive evidence 
32regarding the juvenile's commitment from reports, affidavits and other evidence that is 
33sufficiently reliable.  If requested by the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian or legal 
34custodian or another party, the court shall require that the person who wrote the report or 
35prepared the material appear as a witness and be subject to examination by the court and 
36any party. In the absence of the request, the court may order the person who prepared the 
37report or other material to testify if the court finds that the interests of justice so require.  
38A juvenile or other party who is indigent is entitled to appointment of counsel pursuant to 
39section 3306, subsection 1 for a review conducted pursuant to this subsection.
40Sec. 7.  15 MRSA §3316, sub-§2, ¶A, as repealed and replaced by PL 1999, c. 
41127, Pt. B, §6, is amended to read:
42A.  A commitment of a juvenile to a Department of Corrections juvenile corrections 
43facility pursuant to section 3314 must be for an indeterminate period not to extend 
44beyond the juvenile's 18th birthday unless the court expressly further limits or 
Page 7 - 129LR1572(01)-11extends the indeterminate commitment, as long as the court does not limit the 
2commitment to less than one year nor extend the commitment beyond a juvenile's 
321st birthday and as long as an order does not result in a commitment of less than one 
4year, unless the commitment is for an indeterminate period not to extend beyond the 
5juvenile's 21st birthday.  Nothing in this Part may be construed to prohibit the 
6provision to a juvenile following the expiration of the juvenile's term of commitment 
7of services voluntarily accepted by the juvenile and the juvenile's parents, guardian or 
8legal custodian if the juvenile is not emancipated; except that these services may not 
9be extended beyond the juvenile's 21st birthday.

15B.  An order of disposition, or of any subsequent order modifying disposition, for an 
16abuse of discretion; and
17D.  A detention order entered pursuant to section 3203-A, subsection 5 or any refusal 
18to alter a detention order upon petition of the juvenile pursuant to section 3203-A, 
19subsection 11, for abuse of discretion, provided that the.  The appeal must be handled 
20expeditiously.; and
21H.  A judicial review decision, pursuant to section 3315, for an abuse of discretion.  
22The appeal must be handled expeditiously.
23Sec. 9.  15 MRSA §3405, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2015, c. 100, §5, is further 
24amended to read:
252.  Record on appeals. In appeals taken pursuant to section 3402, subsection 1, 
26paragraphs A and, B and H, review must be on the basis of the record of the proceedings 
27in juvenile court. In the interest of justice, the Supreme Judicial Court may order that the 
28record consist of: 
29A.  The untranscribed sound recording of the proceedings; or
30B.  An agreed or settled statement of facts with the consent of the parties.
31Sec. 10.  34-A MRSA §3805, sub-§1, as amended by PL 1999, c. 583, §31, is

36SUMMARY
37Currently, Maine has no minimum age at which a child may be prosecuted for a 
38crime.  The purpose of this bill is to prevent children under 12 years of age from being 
Page 8 - 129LR1572(01)-11prosecuted for crimes, to prevent children under 14 years of age from being incarcerated, 
2to eliminate the current requirement that, if committed, a juvenile must be committed for 
3at least a year and to prevent courts from imposing dispositions against juveniles that 
4involve commitment without exhausting all other less restrictive alternatives.  The bill 
5also mandates regular opportunities for judicial review of a juvenile’s commitment in 
6addition to providing an appellate avenue for relief from unfavorable reviews.
7The bill provides that if a court imposes a disposition that involves incarceration, the 
8court must conduct a detailed analysis on the record explaining the rationale for the 
9disposition. Such a disposition is authorized only if the court finds certain criteria by clear 
10and convincing evidence. If the court commits a juvenile to a facility, the bill requires 
11periodic judicial review of the incarceration to ensure that the rehabilitative purposes of 
12incarceration are not being outweighed by the harm caused by incarceration.
13The overarching goal of this bill is to ensure that fewer children are in the juvenile 
14justice system and that, if and when they do become involved in the system, there is a 
15presumption against incarceration and a requirement for the regular review of any 
16commitment imposed, in order to minimize the harm that incarceration can cause 
17children.
18This bill amends the statute governing a juvenile's right to counsel to specify that the 
19right to counsel attaches at the juvenile's initial appearance and continues until the court 
20no longer has jurisdiction over the juvenile, including all post-dispositional hearings and 
21during the time of commitment.  This bill also requires counsel appointed by the court to 
22continue to represent the juvenile throughout all proceedings concerning the juvenile, 
23unless relieved by the court.
