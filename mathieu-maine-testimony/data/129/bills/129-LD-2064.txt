Page 1 - 129LR3026(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §563, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2 and affected 
3by §4, is amended to read:
41.  Municipal-maintained structures.  For a structure for which a municipality has 
5maintenance responsibility, the department shall advise the municipality of its inspection 
6findings, and noted deficiencies and recommendations regarding posting or closure.  The 
7municipality has sole responsibility and authority to determine whether a structure must 
8be posted or closed, except that the department may close the structure in cases of 
9emergency or when the department reasonably determines closure is necessary to protect 
10the traveling public from imminent hazard.  If the department becomes aware of 
11deficiencies in a structure that could impact posting or closure decisions, the department 
12shall promptly notify the municipality.  The department shall notify the municipality 
13when a structure requires a posting or closure, and the municipality shall carry out the 
14posting or closure.  The department has the authority to post or close a structure to protect 
15the traveling public from an imminent hazard.  The municipality is responsible for all 
16costs and expenses related to the posting and closure, including any needed notifications, 
17procedures, signing and barricades.
18Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §565, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2 and affected 
19by §4, is amended to read:
202.  Low use or redundant bridges on town ways.  A municipality has maintenance 
21responsibility for all low use bridges on town ways and all redundant bridges on town 
22ways.
23For the capital improvement of a low use bridge on a town way or a redundant bridge on 
24a town way located wholly within one municipality, the municipality shall pay 50% of 
25the cost or 1% of its property valuation, whichever is less.  For a bridge located on a town 
26line, each municipality shall pay 25% of the cost of the capital improvement or 1% of its 
27property valuation, whichever is less, unless the municipalities and the department agree 
28otherwise.  The department shall pay the remaining portion of the cost of the capital 
29improvement subject to available funds.
30Sec. 3.  23 MRSA §566, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2 and affected 
31by §4, is amended to read:
321.  Changes to structures.  If a structure is improved in a manner that affects 
33whether it is defined as a minor span or a bridge, the responsibilities set forth in this 
34subchapter regarding the structure do not change unless the department determines that 
35there exists a reasonable engineering basis for the improvement and the department 
36approves the design plans and specifications of the improvement prior to the construction.  
37The design of the improvement to the structure must be in accordance with department 
38standards and sealed by a professional engineer licensed under Title 32, chapter 19 to 
39practice in this State.  After construction, the department shall inspect the structure and, if 
40the structure is found to conform with the approved design, the department shall accept 
41responsibility for the structure.  If the inspection reveals the structure was not improved 
42in accordance with the department-approved design, the municipality shall make any 
Page 2 - 129LR3026(01)-11necessary corrections to the structure required by the department so that responsibility for 
2the structure is accepted by the department.
3Sec. 4.  23 MRSA §566, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2 and affected 
4by §4, is amended to read:
52.  New structures.  If a municipality constructs a new bridge on a town way, the 
6department shall assume the responsibilities set forth in the subchapter only if the 
7department determines that there is a reasonable engineering basis for the bridge, as 
8opposed to a minor span, and if the department approves the design and construction of 
9the bridge prior to the construction of the bridge.  The bridge must be designed in 
10accordance with department standards and sealed by a professional engineer licensed 
11under Title 32, chapter 19 to practice in this State.  If the inspection reveals the bridge 
12was not constructed in accordance with the department-approved design, the municipality 
13shall make any necessary corrections to the bridge required by the department so that 
14responsibility for the bridge is accepted by the department.
15Sec. 5.  23 MRSA §567, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 314, §2 and affected by §4 and 
16c. 667, Pt. C, §§20 and 22, is amended to read:
17§567.  Bridge capital improvement priorities list
18The department shall biennially annually prepare a list of bridges that are eligible for 
19capital improvement under this subchapter, arranged in priority order using accepted 
20bridge management principles and as constrained by available funding.  The department 
21is the final arbiter as to whether any bridge is placed on the list.  The department shall 
22consult with municipalities regarding the manner of improving low use bridges on town 
23ways and redundant bridges on town ways.
24SUMMARY
25This bill requires the Department of Transportation to notify a municipality when a 
26bridge for which a municipality has maintenance responsibility requires a posting or 
27closure and requires the municipality to carry out the posting or closure.  Current law 
28provides a municipality sole responsibility to determine whether such a bridge must be 
29posted or closed.  The bill provides that the department's responsibility to pay a portion of 
30the cost of a capital improvement for a low use or redundant bridge on a town way is 
31subject to available funds.  It provides that in order for the department to accept certain 
32responsibilities for an improved bridge or for a new bridge, the department must approve 
33the design of the improvements or construction before the improvements are made or the 
34bridge is constructed.  The design of the improvements or construction must meet 
35standards set by the department and be sealed by a professional engineer.  The 
36department must inspect the bridge after it is improved or constructed.  The bill also 
37changes how often the department must prepare a list of bridges that are eligible for 
38capital improvement from biennially to annually and removes the requirement that this 
39list be arranged in priority order using accepted bridge management principles.
