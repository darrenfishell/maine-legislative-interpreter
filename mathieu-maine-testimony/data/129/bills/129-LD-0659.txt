17Sec. 4.  32 MRSA §13781, as amended by PL 2007, c. 85, §§1 and 2, is further 
18amended to read:
19§13781.  Generic and therapeutically equivalent substitution
20A written prescription issued by a practitioner in this State may contain a box in the 
21lower right-hand corner of the prescription form. The following words must appear to the 
22left of this box: "Any drug which that is the generic and therapeutic equivalent of the 
23drug or any biological product that is an interchangeable biological product of the 
24biological product specified above in this prescription must be dispensed, provided that 
25no check mark ( ) has been handwritten in the box in the lower right-hand corner."
26Except with regard to a patient who is paying for a drug or biological product with 
27the patient's own resources, any pharmacist receiving a prescription in which no 
28handwritten check mark ( ) is found in the box provided shall substitute a generic and 
29therapeutically equivalent drug for the drug or an interchangeable biological product for 
30the biological product specified on the prescription if the substituted drug or 
31interchangeable biological product is distributed by a business entity doing business in 
32the United States that is subject to suit and the service of legal process in the United 
33States and the price of the substituted drug or interchangeable biological product does not 
34exceed the price of the drug or biological product specified by the practitioner; except 
35that, when the cost of a prescription is to be reimbursed under the MaineCare program 
36pursuant to Title 22, chapter 855, the pharmacist shall substitute a generic and 
37therapeutically equivalent drug or an interchangeable biological product only when the 
38Department of Health and Human Services has determined that the substitute drug or 
Page 2 - 129LR0762(01)-11interchangeable biological product would be a more cost-effective alternative than the 
2drug or biological product prescribed by the practitioner.  Except for prescribed drugs 
3listed under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 
4United States Code, Section 812, as amended, as Schedule II drugs, with regard to a 
5patient who is paying for a drug or biological product with the patient's own resources, a 
6pharmacist shall inquire about the patient's preference for either the brand-name drug or 
7generic and therapeutically equivalent drug or for either the prescribed biological product 
8or interchangeable biological product and dispense the drug or biological product that the 
9patient prefers.
10Except with regard to a patient who is paying for a drug or biological product with 
11the patient's own resources, if a written prescription issued by a practitioner in this State 
12does not contain the box described in this section, a pharmacist shall substitute a generic 
13and therapeutically equivalent drug for the drug or an interchangeable biological product 
14for the biological product specified on the prescription if the substituted drug or 
15interchangeable biological product is distributed by a business entity doing business in 
16the United States that is subject to suit and the service of legal process in the United 
17States and the price of the substituted drug or interchangeable biological product does not 
18exceed the price of the drug or biological product specified by the practitioner, unless a 
19practitioner has handwritten on the prescription form, along with the practitioner's 
20signature, "dispense as written," "DAW," "brand," "brand necessary" or "brand medically 
21necessary"; except that, when the cost of a prescription is to be reimbursed under the 
22MaineCare program pursuant to Title 22, chapter 855, the pharmacist shall substitute a 
23generic and therapeutically equivalent drug or an interchangeable biological product only 
24when the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that the substitute 
25drug or interchangeable biological product would be a more cost-effective alternative 
26than the drug or biological product prescribed by the practitioner.  Except for prescribed 
27drugs listed under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 
2821 United States Code, Section 812, as amended, as Schedule II drugs, with regard to a 
29patient who is paying for a drug or biological product with the patient's own resources, a 
30pharmacist shall inquire about the patient's preference for either the brand-name drug or 
31generic and therapeutically equivalent drug or for either the prescribed biological product 
32or interchangeable biological product and dispense the drug or biological product that the 
33patient prefers.
34Any pharmacist who substitutes a generic and therapeutically equivalent drug or an 
35interchangeable biological product under this section shall inform the person to whom the 
36drug or interchangeable biological product is dispensed of the substitution.  When any 
37substitution is made under this section, the pharmacist shall cause all information as 
38required by section 13794, the name of the generic and therapeutically equivalent drug, 
39and the name or abbreviation of the drug manufacturer or distributor of that substitute 
40drug and all other information as required by section 13794 or, in the case of an 
41interchangeable biological product, the proper name and the name of the manufacturer of 
42the interchangeable biological product, to appear on the container label of the drug or 
43interchangeable biological product dispensed.
Page 3 - 129LR0762(01)-11This section does not apply to prescriptions ordered by practitioners for patients in 
2hospitals when those prescriptions are filled by a hospital pharmacy or in any institution 
3where a formulary system is established.
4Within 5 business days after a pharmacist dispenses a biological product, the 
5dispensing pharmacist or the pharmacist's designee shall enter in an electronic records 
6system that is electronically accessible to the practitioner who prescribed the biological 
7product the specific biological product dispensed, including the name of the biological 
8product and the manufacturer.  For purposes of this paragraph, "electronic records 
9system" means an interoperable electronic medical records system, an electronic 
10prescribing technology, a pharmacist benefit management system or an electronic 
11pharmacy record.  Entry into an electronic records system as described in this paragraph 
12is presumed to provide notice to the practitioner.  If a pharmacist cannot make an entry in 
13an electronic records system, the pharmacist shall notify the practitioner of the specific 
14biological product dispensed by facsimile, telephone, electronic transmission or other 
15similar means.  Notice to a practitioner under this paragraph is not required if the federal 
16Food and Drug Administration has not approved an interchangeable biological product 
17for the product prescribed or a refill prescription is not changed from the biological 
18product dispensed on the prior filling of the prescription.
19The board shall maintain a link on the board's publicly accessible website to the 
20current list of all biological products determined by the federal Food and Drug 
21Administration to be an interchangeable biological product.
22For the purposes of this section, "drug" does not include biological products.
23Sec. 5.  32 MRSA §13794, first ¶, as amended by PL 1999, c. 130, §14, is further 
24amended to read:
25Every drug dispensed pursuant to prescription, whether for a legend drug or not, must 
26carry on the label the following information:  the prescription number; the date of filling; 
27the patient's name; directions for use; the name and strength of the drug and the amount 
28dispensed, including either the brand name of the drug or, if a generic and therapeutically 
29equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product is dispensed it the label must be in 
30accordance with section 13781; the beyond use date of the drug; the name of the 
31practitioner prescribing the drug; and the name, address and telephone number of the 
32pharmacy where the prescription was compounded and dispensed.  For purposes of this 
33section, "beyond use date" means a date beyond which the contents of the prescription are 
34not recommended to be used.
35SUMMARY
36This bill provides for pharmacist substitution of interchangeable biological products 
37for prescribed biological products in a manner similar to the current regulation of generic 
38drug substitution.  The bill defines "biological product" and "interchangeable biological 
39product."
