12established in this section except that from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the 
13minimum cash wage paid directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than 
14$5.00 per hour.  An employer who elects to use the tip credit must inform the affected 
15employee in advance, as provided for in this subsection, and must be able to show that the 
16employee receives at least the minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit 
17are combined within the established 7-day workweek.  Upon a satisfactory showing by

20The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 
21not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 
22bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 
23employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 
24employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 
25reimbursement from a credit card company.  The employer may not deduct any amount 
26from employee tips charged to a credit card, including, but not limited to, service fees 
27assessed to the employer in connection with the credit card transaction.
28An employer who elects to use the tip credit must inform the affected employee in 
29advance, either orally or in writing, of the following information: a valid tip pooling 
30arrangement limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips in 
31accordance with subsection 2-A shall inform the affected employee in advance, either 
32orally or in writing, of any required tip pool contribution amount from the employee.

35C.  That the amount of tips to be credited as wages may not exceed the value of the 
36tips actually received by the employee;
37D.  That all tips received by the affected employee must be retained by the employee, 
38except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and 
39regularly receive tips in accordance with subsection 2-A;
Page 2 - 129LR0545(01)-11E.  That the tip credit may not apply to any employee who has not been informed by 
2the employer of the provisions for a tip credit; and
3F.  If the employer uses a tip pooling arrangement, any required tip pool contribution 
4amount from the employee.
5Sec. 4.  26 MRSA §666, as amended by PL 2011, c. 483, §1, is further amended to

7§666.  Workers with disabilities
8For any employment to which the minimum wage is applicable, the The director may 
9not issue to an employer for any a person with a disability a special certificate authorizing 
10the employer to pay that person a wage less than the minimum wage, based on the ability 
11of the person to perform the duties required for that employment in comparison to the 
12ability of a person who does not have a disability to perform the same duties.  The 
13director may hold hearings and conduct investigations as necessary for the purpose of 
14fixing the special minimum wage for the person.  A certificate is valid for 2 years from 
15the date of issue and may be renewed by the director.  The director may issue a certificate 
16to cover several employees with disabilities as long as the employer provides 
17documentation justifying the special minimum wage.  An employer may not pay less than 
18the minimum wage to a person by virtue of that person's having a mental or physical 
19disability.  A special certificate authorizing the payment of less than minimum wage to a 
20person with a mental or physical disability issued pursuant to a law of this State or to a 
21federal law before October 1, 2019 is without effect.
22Sec. 5.  Effective date.  This Act takes effect October 1, 2019.
23SUMMARY
24This bill eliminates current exemptions from the minimum wage law that allow the 
25payment of wages at less than the minimum wage rate to individuals employed in certain 
26agricultural jobs, to individuals employed in service jobs in which tipping is customary 
27and to certain individuals with disabilities, effective October 1, 2019.
