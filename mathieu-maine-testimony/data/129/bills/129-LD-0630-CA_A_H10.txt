Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment "11' fl ... / D/ 
Committee: Agriculture Conservation and Forestry 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Contingent future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry as a result of clarifications to the rules regarding food and food products containing hemp­
derived cannabidiol (CBD) and changes to the definition of "industrial hemp" to "hemp" are anticipated to be minor 
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Although the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has indicated that it plans to review its 
regulatory authority regarding hemp-derived products at a later date, it has not given any indication of a timeline or 
guidance on possible revisions. Any rules regarding CBD that conflict with the USFDA's cuffent guidance could 
result in potential future costs if subject to federal enforcement actions.
