The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend eligiblity criteria under Chapter 101: 
MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section 17, Allowances for Community Support Services. The eligibility 
changes are not outlined in the bill, rather the department is given multiple considerations to include in the eligiblity 
assessment of an individual. These changes should add back some eligible individuals for coverage under this section 
of policy who were removed in February of 2016 with no baseline deappropriation. As there was no deappropriation 
when eligiblity changes were made in February 2016, some of the costs associated with the changes in this bill will 
not require new appropriations. However, as the specific requirements for being eligible will not be known until the 
department updates the eligiblity process, it is possible some individuals who were not eligible in February 2016 will 
become eligible now and require new appropriations and allocations. It is not lmown how many new individuals will 
be eligible for this service, so no estimate of the new costs are made at this time.
