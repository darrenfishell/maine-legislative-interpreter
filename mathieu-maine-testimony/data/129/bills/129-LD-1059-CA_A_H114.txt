This bill allows the Department of Marine Resources to adopt rules establishing an apprentice program for ent1y into 
the scallop fishery and to create an apprentice scallop dragging license. The department has indicated that after 
rulemaking is complete in fiscal year 2020-21 approximately 50 applicants would apply for the $250 apprentice 
scallop dragging license, generating $12,500 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Scallop Research Fund 
(SRF). Each apprentice license also requires an existing scallop dragger license holder to pay a $250 surcharge, 
generating another $12,500 to the SRF. This bill also includes an ongoing Other Special Revenue Funds allocation 
of $25,000 starting in fiscal year 2020-21 to allow for the expenditure of the funds in the SRF for administration of 
the apprenticeship program, research and development programs that address the restoration, development or 
conservation of scallop resources.
