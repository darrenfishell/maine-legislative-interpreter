The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to study the impact of increases in the 
minimum wage and any statutory requirements for earned paid leave on the reimbursement rates for all services 
reimbursed under the DHHS's rnle Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual Chapter III. The DHHS is required to 
develop an assessment of future shortfalls and develop a plan to ensure that reimbursement rates remain sufficient to 
cover any future increases. The DHHS may consult or contract with any experts or stakeholders that the DHHS 
dete1mines appropriate. The DHHS would see a fiscal impact as a result of contracted rate studies that may need to 
occur to fulfill the requirements of this bill. The average contract amount for a rate study is $105,000 and if all 
sections required an outside contractor the cost could be as much as $1,890,000. As it is not known which sections of 
policy will require an outside contractor and which can be done by the DHHS, no estimate of the cost for the rate 
studies can be detennined at this time.
