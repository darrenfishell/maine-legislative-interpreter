1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. Instead of increasing the 
3 penalty for the illegal passing of a school bus as in the bill, the amendment allows the 
4 State or a municipality to use a traffic surveillance camera mounted on a school bus to 
5 prove, enforce or open an investigation into a violation of illegally passing a school bus. 
6 The amendment provides that information recorded by a traffic surveillance camera 
7 mounted on a school bus is confidential and may be used only to prove, enforce or open 
8 an investigation into a violation and may not be retained for more than 30 days unless it is 
9 used to open an investigation. It also clarifies that the penalty provision in statute 
10 regarding overtaking and passing school buses applies only to the passing or overtaking 
11 of a school bus. 
12 The amendment also allows school buses to be equipped with extended stop arms that 
13 when activated extend 3 to 6 feet outward from the left side of a school bus.
