35 provision of services be within the State and provides a structure for the required 
36 reporting of data to facilitate an evaluation of the effectiveness of the credit by the Office

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill increases the maximum tax credit ce1iificates under the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit program from $5 
million to $15 million per year. It would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of $1,282,500 in fiscal year 
2019-20 and $2, 755,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 and a reduction in Local Government Fund revenue of $67,500 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $145,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. 
The responsibilities outlined in this bill for the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability 
(OPEGA) are already reflected in statutorily assigned work for OPEGA in reviewing tax expenditures. However, in 
order for OPEGA to meet the February 1, 2023 deadline for submitting their evaluation of this credit to the Taxation 
Committee, the Government Oversight Committee will need to prioritize this work over other planned tax expenditure 
reviews. Otherwise, OPEGA will need additional staff or contract resources to complete their review and submit their 
evaluation by February 1, 2023. 
Additional costs to the Finance Authority of Maine associated with rep01iing requirements can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
