7(2)  A noise level of 75 decibels when subjected to an operational test measured

9As used in this paragraph, "motorboat" does not include an "airboat," which has the

11Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §13068-A, sub-§10, ¶A-1 is enacted to read:
12A-1.  A person may not operate an airboat in such a manner as to exceed noise level 
13limits established by the commissioner by routine technical rules as described in Title 
145, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  For purposes of this paragraph, "airboat" means a 
15flat-bottomed watercraft propelled by an aircraft-type propeller and powered by 
16either an aircraft engine or an automotive engine.
17Sec. 3.  Collection of information.  The Department of Inland Fisheries and

19information regarding airboats, including, but not limited to, information regarding uses 
20of airboats, noise levels and complaints and suggestions for reducing complaints 
21regarding the use of airboats, from interested parties, including, but not limited to, harbor 
22masters, town clerks and residents of coastal towns and airboat users and sellers.  Based 
23on the suggestions, the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the 
24Commissioner of Marine Resources may submit legislation to the First Regular Session 
25of the 130th Legislature to implement whatever suggestions the commissioners determine 
26are necessary.  As used in this section, "airboat" means a flat-bottomed watercraft 
27propelled by an aircraft-type propeller and powered by either an aircraft engine or an 
28automotive engine.
29SUMMARY
30This bill exempts airboats, which are defined as flat-bottomed watercraft propelled by 
31an aircraft-type propeller and powered by either an aircraft engine or an automotive 
32engine, from the noise level limits imposed on other watercraft.  Instead, this bill allows 
33the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish noise level limits for 
34airboats by routine technical rules.
35This bill also requires the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the 
36Department of Marine Resources to jointly solicit and collect information regarding 
37airboats, including uses of airboats, noise levels and complaints and suggestions for 
38reducing complaints regarding the use of airboats, from interested parties, such as harbor 
39masters, town clerks and residents of coastal towns and airboat users and sellers.  Based 
Page 2 - 129LR3130(01)-11on the suggestions, the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the 
2Commissioner of Marine Resources are authorized to submit legislation to the First 
3Regular Session of the 130th Legislature to implement whatever suggestions the 
4commissioners determine are necessary.
