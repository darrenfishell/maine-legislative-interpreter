8 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or

10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes the provision 
12 of the bill that lowers the age of qualification to be an election official from 17 years of 
13 age to 16 years of age. 
14 The amendment retains all other provisions of the bill, including the provisions of the 
15 bill that change the candidate withdrawal provisions for United States Senator, 
16 Representative to Congress and Governor to match those of other offices, but further 
17 clarifies the laws governing the candidate withdrawal process for all federal, state and 
18 county offices, other than for United States President, as follows. 
19 1. For all elections, as in cunent practice, the name of a candidate who withdraws 70 
20 days or more before any election for any reason will be removed from the ballot. 
21 2. For general elections, as in current practice, a candidate who is a member of a 
22 political party and who withdraws before the 2nd Monday in July preceding the general 
23 election may be replaced by the appropriate political committee no later than 5 p.m. of 
24 the 4th Monday in July preceding the general election. The replacement candidate must 
25 be listed on the general election ballot. 
26 3. For general elections, as in current practice, a candidate who is a member of a 
27 political party and who dies or withdraws due to incapacity may be replaced by the 
28 appropriate political committee as soon as practicable. Also as in current practice, if the 
29 Secretary of State receives notification of the replacement candidate no later than 60 days 
30 before the general election, new ballots listing the replacement candidate must be printed. 
31 If the Secretary of State receives notification of the replacement candidate less than 60 
32 days before the general election, however, the amendment newly clarifies that the 
33 Secreta1y of State is not required to print new ballots but may amend ballots already 
34 printed or issue a notice to supplement ballots already printed informing voters of the 
35 replacement candidate and instructing voters how they may vote for the replacement 
36 candidate. 
37 4. For general elections, as in current practice, the name of a candidate who 
38 withdraws for a reason other than incapacity less than 70 days before the general election 
39 will not be removed from the ballot and voters casting ballots after the withdrawal will be 
40 notified that the candidate has withdrawn and that a vote for that candidate will not be 
41 counted.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 656, L.D. 1904 (_~;-C/ci')_) 
1 5. For uncontested primmy elections, as in current practice, if a candidate dies or 
2 becomes disqualified before the primmy election or withdraws for another reason 70 days 
3 or more before the primary election, the appropriate political committee may select a 
4 replacement candidate. Also as in current practice, if the Secretmy of State receives 
5 notification of the replacement candidate 60 days or more before the primmy election, 
6 new ballots listing the replacement candidate must be printed. If the Secretmy of State 
7 receives notification of the replacement candidate less than 60 days before the primmy 
8 election, however, the mnendment newly clarifies that the Secretmy of State is not 
9 required to print new ballots but may mnend ballots already printed or issue a notice to 
10 supplement ballots already printed informing voters of the replacement candidate and 
11 instructing voters how they may vote for the replacement candidate. 
12 6. For contested primmy elections, as in current practice, if a candidate dies or 
13 becomes disqualified 70 days or more before the primary election, the candidate's name 
14 will be removed from the ballot but a replacement candidate may not be named. If a 
15 candidate dies or becomes disqualified less than 70 days before a contested primmy 
16 election, the mnendment newly clarifies that although the candidate's name will not be 
17 removed from the ballot, voters casting ballots after the death or disqualification will be 
18 notified that the candidate is no longer running for office and that votes for the candidate 
19 will not be counted. 
20 7. For both contested and uncontested primmy elections, as in cu1Tent practice, the 
21 nmne of a candidate who withdraws less than 70 days before the primmy election will not 
22 be removed from the ballot and voters casting ballots after the withdrawal will be notified 
23 that the candidate has withdrawn and that a vote for that candidate will not be counted. 
24 8. For special elections to fill a vacancy in an office, as in current practice, if a 
25 candidate dies or withdraws from the election for any reason, the candidate's name will 
26 not be removed from the ballot and voters casting ballots after the death or withdrawal 
27 will be notified that the candidate has died or has withdrawn and that a vote for that 
28 candidate will not be counted. 
29 The amendment also makes a technical change to the law governing municipal 
30 elections by removing language requiring ballots to be printed so that voters mm·k their 
31 choices in squares printed to the left of each candidate's name and substituting language 
32 authorizing ballots to be printed in any way that allows the voter to designate the voter's 
33 choice.
