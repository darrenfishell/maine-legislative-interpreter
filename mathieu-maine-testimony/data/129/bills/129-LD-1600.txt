2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §201, sub-§3-A, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 294, §2, is 
3amended to read:
4B.  The employee is a law enforcement officer, corrections officer, E-9-1-1 
5dispatcher, firefighter or emergency medical services person and is diagnosed by an 
6allopathic physician or an osteopathic physician licensed under Title 32, chapter 48 or 
7chapter 36, respectively, with a specialization in psychiatry or a psychologist licensed 
8under Title 32, chapter 56 as having post-traumatic stress disorder that resulted from 
9work stress, that the work stress was extraordinary and unusual compared with that 
10experienced by the average employee and the work stress and not some other source 
11of stress was the predominant cause of the post-traumatic stress disorder, in which 
12case the post-traumatic stress disorder is presumed to have arisen out of and in the 
13course of the worker's employment.  This presumption may be rebutted by clear and 
14convincing evidence to the contrary.  For purposes of this paragraph, "law 
15enforcement officer," "corrections officer," "firefighter" and "emergency medical 
16services person" have the same meaning as in section 328-A, subsection 1.  For the 
17purposes of this paragraph, "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" means a person who receives calls 
18made to the E-9-1-1 system and dispatches emergency services.  "E-9-1-1 dispatcher" 
19includes an emergency medical dispatcher as defined in Title 32, section 85-A, 
20subsection 1, paragraph D.
21By January 1, 2022, the board shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of 
22the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters that includes an analysis of the 
23number of claims brought under this paragraph, the portion of those claims that 
24resulted in a settlement or award of benefits and the effect of the provisions of this 
25paragraph on costs to the State and its subdivisions.  The Department of 
26Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Human Resources and the 
27Department of Public Safety shall assist the board in developing the report, and the 
28board shall seek the input of an association, the membership of which consists 
29exclusively of counties, municipalities and other political or administrative 
30subdivisions, in the development of the report.
31This paragraph is repealed October 1, 2022.
32SUMMARY
33This bill adds corrections officers and E-9-1-1 dispatchers to the list of employees for 
34whom there is a rebuttable presumption under the laws governing workers' compensation 
35that when the employee is diagnosed by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist as having 
36post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from work stress that was extraordinary and 
37unusual, the post-traumatic stress disorder is presumed to have arisen out of and in the 
38course of the worker's employment.
