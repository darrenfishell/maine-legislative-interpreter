7State as the trustee and steward of the State's groundwater on behalf of the citizens of the 
8State and requires the State to endeavor to ensure that the groundwater will always be 
9available to the benefit of all the citizens of the State.  It also directs the State to take all 
10reasonable measures to ensure an adequate supply of usable groundwater for the citizens
