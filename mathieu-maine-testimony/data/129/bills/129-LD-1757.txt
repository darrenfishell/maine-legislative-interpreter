3is further amended to read:
43.  Performance metrics.  The trust shall develop quantifiable measures of 
5performance metrics for all programs it administers and to which it will hold accountable 
6all recipients of funding from the trust and recipients of funds used to deliver energy and 
7energy efficiency and weatherization programs administered or funded by the trust.  Such 
8measures performance metrics may include, but are not limited to, reduced energy 
9consumption, increased use of alternative energy resources, reduced heating costs, 
10reduced capacity demand for natural gas, electricity and fossil fuels, reduced carbon 
11dioxide emissions, program and overhead costs and cost-effectiveness, the number of 
12new jobs created by the award of trust funds, the number of energy efficiency trainings or 
13certification courses completed and the amount of sales generated.
14Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. A, 
15§§10 to 13, is further amended to read:
164.  Triennial plan.  The board shall vote on a detailed, triennial, energy efficiency, 
17alternative energy resources and conservation plan that includes the quantifiable measures 
18of performance metrics developed under subsection 3 and make a full report of the vote 
19to the commission in accordance with this subsection. The triennial plan must provide 
20integrated planning, program design and implementation strategies for all energy 
21efficiency, alternative energy resources and conservation programs administered by the 
22trust, including but not limited to the electric efficiency and conservation programs under 
23section 10110, the natural gas efficiency and conservation programs under section 10111, 
24the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 10109, the Heating 
25Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund under section 10119 and any state or federal 
26funds or publicly directed funds accepted by or allocated to the trust for the purposes of 
27this chapter.  The triennial plan must include provisions for the application of appropriate 
28program funds to support workforce development efforts that are consistent with and 
29promote the purposes of the trust.  Beginning January 1, 2011, the triennial plan must 
30specify the appropriate participation of the State in national and regional carbon markets.  
31The plan must be consistent with take into consideration the comprehensive state energy 
32plan pursuant to Title 2, section 9, subsection 3, paragraph C.  The plan must include, but 
33is not limited to, efficiency and conservation program budget allocations, objectives, 
34targets, performance metrics, program designs, program implementation strategies, 
35timelines and other relevant information.
36A.  The triennial plan must be developed by the trust, in consultation with entities and 
37agencies engaged in delivering efficiency programs in the State, to authorize and 
38govern or coordinate implementation of energy efficiency and weatherization 
39programs in the State.  The triennial plan must identify all the maximum achievable 
40cost-effective energy efficiency savings, as defined by rule by the trust, and related 
41programs that could be implemented pursuant to sections 10110 and 10111, the costs 
42and benefits of such programs and the basis and support for such identified costs and 
43benefits.  The trust shall conduct an evaluation of all the maximum cost-effective 
Page 2 - 129LR1639(01)-11potential for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency savings in the State at least 
2once every 5 3 years.
3(1)  Transmission and distribution utilities and natural gas utilities shall furnish 
4data to the trust that the trust requests under this subsection to develop and 
5implement the triennial plan or conduct the evaluation of all cost-effective 
6potential for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency savings subject to such 
7confidential treatment as a utility may request and the board determines 
8appropriate pursuant to section 10106.  The costs of providing the data are 
9deemed reasonable and prudent expenses of the utilities and are recoverable in 
10rates.
11(2)  The Maine State Housing Authority and the Department of Health and 
12Human Services shall furnish to the trust data pertaining to the identity, location 
13and contact information, but not including income or asset information, of 
14households that qualify for low-income programs, as determined necessary by the 
15trust to develop and implement the triennial plan and to evaluate program 
16effectiveness.  Data received pursuant to this subparagraph is deemed to be 
17received by the commission and is subject to a protective order issued by the 
18commission pursuant to section 1311-A.
19B.  In developing the triennial plan, the staff of the trust shall consult the board and 
20provide the opportunity for the board to provide input on drafts of the plan.
21B-1.  In developing the triennial plan, the trust shall provide the joint standing 
22committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters an opportunity 
23to provide input on the plan, which may occur at the same time the trust consults with 
24other entities in the development of the plan.
25C.  The board shall review and approve the triennial plan by affirmative vote of 2/3 of 
26the trustees upon a finding that the plan is consistent with the statutory authority for 
27each source of funds that will be used to implement the plan, advances the state 
28energy efficiency targets in paragraph F and, reflects the best practices of program 
29administration under subsection 2 and is consistent with the provisions of this section.  
30The plan must include, but is not limited to, efficiency and conservation program 
31budget allocations, objectives, targets, measures of performance, program designs, 
32program implementation strategies, timelines and other relevant information.
33D.  Prior to submission of the triennial plan to the commission, the trust shall offer to 
34provide a detailed briefing on the draft plan to the joint standing committee of the 
35Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters and, at the request of the 
36committee, shall provide such a briefing and opportunity for input from the 
37committee.  After providing such opportunity for input and making any changes as a 
38result of any input received, the board shall deliver the plan to the commission for its 
39review and approval.  The commission shall open an adjudicatory proceeding and 
40issue an order either approving the plan and issuing the appropriate orders to 
41transmission and distribution utilities and gas utilities or rejecting the plan and stating 
42the reasons for the rejection to review the triennial plan.  The commission shall 
43review the triennial plan to determine whether it will capture the maximum 
44achievable cost-effective energy efficiency savings.  In conducting the review, the 
45commission shall defer to the trust's calculations of energy savings as long as the 
Page 3 - 129LR1639(01)-11calculations were conducted consistent with rules of the trust and are supported by 
2evidence in the record and the trust used a reasonable and transparent process to 
3make the technical determinations necessary to make those calculations.  The 
4commission shall reject elements of the plan that propose to use funds generated 
5pursuant to sections 3210-C, 10110, 10111 or 10119 if the plan fails to reasonably 
6explain how these elements of the program would achieve the objectives and 
7implementation requirements of the programs established under those sections or the 
8measures of performance metrics under subsection 3.  If the commission approves the 
9triennial plan, the commission shall issue the appropriate orders to transmission and 
10distribution utilities and natural gas utilities for the procurement of energy efficiency 
11resources identified within the plan pursuant to section 10110, subsection 4-A and 
12section 10111, subsection 2.  If the commission rejects the triennial plan, the 
13commission shall issue an order stating the reasons for the rejection.  Funds generated 
14under these statutory authorities may not be used pursuant to the triennial plan unless 
15those elements of the plan proposing to use the funds have been approved by the 
16commission.  The commission shall approve all elements of the triennial plan it 
17determines to be cost-effective, reliable and achievable and shall incorporate into gas 
18utility and transmission and distribution rates sufficient revenue to provide for the 
19procurement of energy efficiency resources identified within the plan pursuant to 
20section 10110, subsection 4-A and section 10111, subsection 2.  The commission 
21shall approve or reject the entire plan or elements of the plan within 120 days of its 
22delivery to the commission.  The board, within 30 days of final commission approval 
23of its the triennial plan, shall submit the triennial plan to the joint standing committee 
24of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters together with any 
25explanatory or other supporting material as the committee may request and, at the 
26request of the committee, shall provide a detailed briefing on the final triennial plan.  
27After receipt of the triennial plan, the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
28having jurisdiction over energy matters may submit legislation relating to the 
29triennial plan.
30E.  The trust shall determine the period to be covered by the triennial plan except that 
31the period of the plan may not interfere with the delivery of any existing contracts to 
32provide energy efficiency services that were previously procured pursuant to 
33efficiency and conservation programs administered by the commission.
34F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 
35energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 
36consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 
37and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 
38funding necessary to meet those goals:
39(1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;
40(2)  Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 
41to participate in and share the costs of cost-effective home weatherization to a 
42minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;
43(3)  Reducing peak-load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 
44megawatts by 2020;
Page 4 - 129LR1639(01)-11(4)  By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 
220% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 
3pursuant to the measures of performance metrics approved by the commission 
4under section 10120;
5(5)  Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 
6efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and
7(6)  Reducing Contributing to the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
8the heating and cooling of buildings in the State by amounts consistent with the 
9State's goals greenhouse gas emission levels established in Title 38, section 576.
10The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 
11emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 
12program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 
13may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 
14generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.
15Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 
16trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 
17as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 
18low-income weatherization programs.
19After the triennial plan is approved, the trust or any party to the triennial plan may 
20petition for, or the commission may initiate on its own, consideration of revising the 
21calculations of avoided energy costs upon a showing that, subsequent to the 
22publication of the avoided cost study relied upon, changes in price forecasts would 
23result in more than a 25% change in the value of avoided cost affecting a significant 
24portion of the program activity in the triennial plan.
25As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 
26#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 
27processes.
28Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§5, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, 
29§3, is amended to read:
30D.  The performance of the trust and individual programs and program delivery 
31agents or service providers in meeting the objectives, targets and measures of 
32performance metrics approved by the commission and contained in the triennial plan.
33Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, §3, is 
34amended to read:
356.  Updated plans.  Within 30 90 days of completion of the annual report under 
36subsection 5, the director shall submit to the board an annual update plan describing any 
37significant changes to the triennial plan under subsection 4 related to program budget 
38allocations, goals, targets, measures of performance metrics, program designs, 
39implementation strategies, timelines and other relevant information for the year ahead for 
40all funds administered and managed by the trust. The director or any contractor, grantee 
41or agency delivering programs may not execute any significant changes until the changes 
42are approved by the board and, in the case of significant changes to programs using funds 
Page 5 - 129LR1639(01)-11generated by assessments under this chapter, until the changes are also approved by the 
2commission using the same standard as for the triennial plan.
3All annual update plans must be presented to the commission and the joint standing 
4committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters.
5Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§4-A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 255, §1, is 
6further amended to read:
74-A.  Procurement of cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation resources.  
8The commission shall ensure that transmission and distribution utilities on behalf of their 
9ratepayers procure all through the trust the maximum achievable cost-effective electric 
10energy efficiency and conservation resources found by the commission to be cost-
11effective, reliable and achievable pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4, except that the 
12commission may not require the inclusion in rates under this subsection of a total amount 
13that exceeds 4% of total retail electricity and transmission and distribution sales in the 
14State as determined by the commission by rule.  The cost of procurement of cost-effective 
15electric energy efficiency and conservation resources is a just and reasonable element of 
16rates.  The commission may issue any appropriate orders to transmission and distribution 
17utilities necessary to achieve the goals of this subsection.  When determining the amount 
18of maximum achievable cost-effective electric energy efficiency resources to be procured 
19under this subsection, the commission shall:
20A.  Consider electric energy efficiency resources that are reasonably foreseeable to be 
21acquired by the trust using all other sources of revenue, including, but not limited to, 
22the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 10109;
23B.  Ensure that Apply the discount rate adopted by the trust and ensure that the 
24calculations of avoided energy costs and the budget identified by the trust in its 
25triennial plan as needed to capture all cost-effective electric energy efficiency 
26resources are reasonable, based on sound evidence and make use of best practices 
27across the region; and are consistent with rules adopted by the trust and are supported 
28by evidence in the record.  Avoided energy costs must include but are not limited to 
29the following elements:
30(1)  Retail value of electricity supply including a wholesale risk premium;
31(2)  Statewide average value of avoided marginal transmission and distribution 
32costs;
33(3)  Statewide average for line losses; and
34(4)  Demand reduction induced price effects.
35The trust shall use, and the commission shall give deference to, values for each 
36element of avoided energy cost from a regional avoided energy supply cost study as 
37long as the analysis has been developed through a transparent process, with input 
38from state agencies, public advocates, utilities or energy efficiency administrators 
39from at least 3 other states in New England and the analysis has been published not 
40more than 24 months prior to the trust's filing of the plan. When values specific to the 
41State are not available in the regional study, the trust may use, and the commission 
Page 6 - 129LR1639(01)-11shall give deference to, regional values provided in that regional study or values 
2determined from other sources when supported by evidence in the record; and
3C.  Maximize total electricity savings for all ratepayers.
4The commission shall consider gross efficiency savings for the purpose of determining 
5savings that are cost-effective, reliable and achievable and.  The commission shall 
6consider both whether the trust is taking reasonable steps to achieve high net and gross 
7efficiency savings for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of the amount 
8identified by the trust in its triennial plan as needed to capture all cost-effective electric 
9energy efficiency resources, including but not limited to the use of national standard 
10practices as identified by the trust by rule.
11Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules under Title 5, chapter 375, 
12subchapter 2-A.
13Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §10111, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, §3, is 
14amended to read:
151.  Program established.  In accordance with the goals and objectives of the triennial 
16plan, the trust shall establish a cost-effective conservation program to promote the 
17efficient use of natural gas.  Each gas utility in the State that serves at least 5,000 
18residential customers shall contribute data and other relevant information to assist in the 
19development of the program. In determining whether the program is cost-effective, the 
20trust may consider whether it promotes sustainable economic development or reduces 
21greenhouse gas emissions to the extent the trust can quantify or otherwise reasonably 
22identify such effects.  The trust shall seek to encourage efficiency in natural gas use, 
23provide incentives for the development of new, energy-efficient business activity cost-
24effective energy efficiency measures in the State and take into account the cost and 
25benefits of energy efficiency and conservation to existing business activity in the State.
26A.  The trust shall consider, without limitation, a natural gas conservation program 
27that:
28(1)  Increases consumer awareness of cost-effective options for conserving 
29energy;
30(2)  Creates more favorable market conditions for the increased use of efficient 
31products and services; and
32(3)  Promotes sustainable economic development and reduces environmental 
33damage.
34B.  The trust shall apportion available funds such that:
35(1)  A reasonable percentage of the available funds is directed to programs for 
36low-income residential consumers, as defined by the trust. The trust shall 
37establish the percentage based on an assessment of the opportunity for cost-
38effective conservation measures for such consumers, including an assessment of 
39the number of low-income residential consumers that may be eligible for such 
40programs;
Page 7 - 129LR1639(01)-11(2)  A reasonable percentage of the available funds is directed to programs for 
2small business consumers, as defined by the trust. The trust shall establish the 
3percentage based on an assessment of the opportunity for cost-effective 
4conservation measures for such consumers. In defining "small business" for the 
5purposes of this subparagraph, the trust shall consider definitions of that term 
6used for other programs in this State that assist small businesses; and
7(3)  To the greatest extent practicable, the remaining available funds are 
8apportioned in a manner that allows all other consumers to have a reasonable 
9opportunity to participate in one or more conservation programs.
10Sec. 7.  35-A MRSA §10111, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 358, §1, is 
11further amended to read:
122.  Procurement level.  The natural gas conservation fund, which is a nonlapsing 
13fund, is established to carry out the purposes of this section.  The commission shall assess 
14each gas utility, in accordance with the triennial plan, an amount necessary to capture all 
15cost-effective energy efficiency that is achievable and reliable for those consumers who 
16are eligible to receive funds from the natural gas conservation fund ensure that gas 
17utilities on behalf of their ratepayers procure through the trust the maximum achievable 
18cost-effective natural gas energy efficiency resources.  To the extent that such an analysis 
19is available, the commission shall ensure that calculations of avoided energy costs used to 
20determine the maximum achievable cost-effective energy efficiency resources use the 
21result of a regional analysis as long as the analysis was conducted consistent with rules of 
22the commission, was developed through a reasonable and transparent process with input 
23from each energy efficiency program administrator or state and is supported by evidence 
24in the record.  The commission may issue any appropriate order to the gas utilities 
25necessary to achieve the goals of this subsection, including the collection of funds for the 
26procurement of cost-effective energy efficiency resources.  The commission shall direct a 
27gas utility that collects any portion of the assessment funds under this subsection from a 
28customer that is a large-volume manufacturer and large-volume agricultural business to 
29collect the assessment funds only on the first 1,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural gas 
30used by that manufacturer or agricultural business in each year.  The limitation on the 
31collection of the assessment funds from large-volume manufacturers and large-volume 
32agricultural businesses may not affect the trust's determination of the amount necessary to 
33capture all cost-effective energy efficiency that is achievable and reliable.  The limitation 
34does not limit prohibit the eligibility of a large-volume manufacturer or large-volume 
35agricultural business to participate in a natural gas conservation program.  All amounts 
36collected under this subsection must be transferred to the natural gas conservation fund.  
37Any interest on funds in the fund must be credited to the fund.  Funds not spent in any 
38fiscal year remain in the fund to be used for the purposes of this section.
39When determining the maximum achievable cost-effective natural gas energy efficiency 
40resources, the commission shall ensure that a discount rate and calculations of avoided 
41energy costs are consistent with rules adopted by the trust and are supported by evidence 
42in the record.  Avoided energy costs must include but are not limited to the retail value of 
43natural gas supply including a wholesale risk premium and demand reduction induced 
44price effects.  The trust shall use, and the commission shall give deference to, values for 
45each element of avoided energy cost from a regional avoided energy supply cost study as 
Page 8 - 129LR1639(01)-11long as the analysis has been developed through a transparent process, with input from 
2state agencies, public advocates, utilities or energy efficiency administrators from at least 
33 other states in New England and the analysis has been published not more than 24 
4months prior to the trust's filing of the triennial plan.  When values specific to the State 
5are not available in the regional study, the trust may use, and the commission shall give 
6deference to, regional values provided in that regional study or values determined from 
7other sources when supported by evidence in the record.  After the triennial plan is 
8approved, the trust or any party to the triennial plan may petition for, or the commission 
9may initiate on its own, consideration of revising the calculations of avoided energy costs 
10upon a showing that, subsequent to the publication of the avoided cost study relied upon, 
11changes in price forecasts would result in more than a 25% change in the value of 
12avoided cost affecting a significant portion of the program activity in the triennial plan.
13The assessments charged to funds collected from gas utilities under this section are just 
14and reasonable costs for rate-making purposes and must be reflected in the rates of gas 
15utilities.
16All funds collected pursuant to this section are collected under the authority and for the 
17purposes of this section and are deemed to be held in trust for the purposes of benefiting 
18natural gas consumers served by the gas utilities assessed under this subsection. In the 
19event funds are not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years of being 
20collected from consumers, the commission shall ensure that the value of those funds is 
21returned to consumers.
22For purposes of this subsection, "large-volume manufacturer" means a customer that is a 
23gas utility ratepayer engaged in manufacturing in the State and purchases at least 
241,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural gas per year.  For purposes of this subsection, 
25"large-volume agricultural business" means a customer that is a gas utility ratepayer that 
26purchases at least 1,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural gas per year and is engaged in 
27the commercial growing or harvesting of plants or commercial aquaculture, as defined in 
28Title 12, section 6001, subsection 1, in the State.
29Rules adopted by the commission under this subsection are routine technical rules as 
30defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
31Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §10120, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, §3, is 
32amended to read:
331.  Performance metrics.  The trust shall incorporate measures of performance 
34metrics in the triennial plan.  The measures of performance metrics must define the 
35electricity, natural gas and heating fuel savings targets established in section 10104, 
36subsection 4, paragraph F and specify the measures metrics for assessing progress in 
37meeting the targets. The commission shall ratify measures of performance metrics 
38incorporated in the triennial plan if it finds that these measures metrics satisfy the 
39requirements of this chapter, including the principles described in section 10104, 
40subsection 2, and are in the public interest. The commission and the trust may revise one 
41or more of the measures of performance metrics in the triennial plan at any time by 
42mutual agreement.
43Sec. 9.  35-A MRSA §10120, sub-§4 is enacted to read:
Page 9 - 129LR1639(01)-114.  Regional analysis of avoided costs.  The commission shall participate in any 
2New England-wide process to establish a common analysis for determining the avoided 
3costs of energy efficiency resources.  The commission shall, at a minimum, provide input 
4on the scope of work for any analysis, provide information specific to the State that may 
5be useful for the analysis and review and provide feedback on drafts or other regional 
6work products.  The trust shall pay that portion attributable to the State of the cost of 
7developing an avoided cost analysis.  This subsection does not limit the ability of the trust 
8to participate in the development of a regional avoided cost analysis.
9SUMMARY
10This bill amends the Efficiency Maine Trust Act to:
111.  Make changes to the Efficiency Maine Trust's triennial plan, including requiring 
12the Maine State Housing Authority and the Department of Health and Human Services to 
13provide data to the Efficiency Maine Trust regarding households that qualify for low-
14income programs to assist the trust with developing and implementing the triennial plan.  
15Data received by the trust is subject to a protective order to preserve confidentiality;
162.  Clarify the process for the adjudicatory proceeding for the approval or rejection of 
17the triennial plan by the Public Utilities Commission;
183.  Extend from 30 days to 90 days the amount of time the Director of the Efficiency 
19Maine Trust has to provide the Efficiency Maine Trust Board with an annual update plan 
20describing significant changes to the triennial plan;
214.  Establish standards of review to be used by the commission when reviewing the 
22triennial plan;
235.  Remove the requirement that the trust preserve the opportunity for carbon 
24emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market; and
256.  Require the commission to participate in a New England-wide process to establish 
26a common analysis for determining the avoided costs of energy efficiency resources.
