Page 1 - 129LR0087(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  21-A MRSA §1125,  sub-§2-A,  as amended by IB 2015, c. 1, §16, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 2-A.  Seed money restrictions.  To be eligible for certification, a participating 
5 candidate may collect and spend  only seed money contributions  subsequent  to becoming 
6 a candidate  and prior to certification.  A participating  candidate may not solicit, accept  or 
7 collect seed money contributions after certification as a Maine Clean Election Act 
8 candidate.  A participating  candidate may not solicit, accept or collect seed money  
9 contributions within a voting place  or on public property within 250 feet of the entrance 
10 to the voting place.
11 A.  All goods and services received prior  to certification must be paid for with seed 
12 money contributions, except for goods  and services that are excluded from  the 
13 definition of contribution in section 1012, subsection 2, paragraph B.  It is a violation 
14 of this chapter for a participating candidate to use fund revenues received after 
15 certification to pay  for goods and services received  prior  to certification.
16 B.  Prior to certification, a participating candidate may obligate an amount greater 
17 than the seed money collected, but may only receive that portion of goods and 
18 services that has been paid for or will be paid for with seed money.   A participating 
19 candidate who has accepted contributions  or made expenditures that do not comply 
20 with the seed money restrictions under this chapter may petition the commission to 
21 remain eligible  for certification  as a Maine Clean  Election Act candidate in 
22 accordance with rules of the commission, if the failure to comply was unintentional  
23 and does not  constitute a  significant infraction of these restrictions.
24 C.  Upon requesting  certification, a participating  candidate shall  file a report  of all 
25 seed money  contributions and expenditures.  If the candidate is certified, any unspent 
26 seed money will be deducted from the amount distributed to the candidate as 
27 provided in subsection 8-F.
28 Sec. 2.  21-A MRSA §1125, sub-§3,  as amended by IB 2015, c. 1, §18, is further  
29 amended to read:
30 3.  Qualifying contributions.  Participating  candidates  must obtain qualifying 
31 contributions during the  qualifying period as follows:
32 A.  For a gubernatorial  candidate, at least 3,200 verified registered voters of this State 
33 must support  the candidacy by providing  a qualifying contribution to that candidate;
34 B.  For a candidate  for the State Senate, at least 175 verified registered voters from  
35 the candidate's electoral division must support the candidacy by providing  a 
36 qualifying contribution to that candidate; or
37 C.  For a candidate  for the State House  of Representatives, at least 60 verified 
38 registered voters from the candidate's electoral  division  must support the candidacy 
39 by providing a qualifying contribution to that candidate.
Page 2 - 129LR0087(01)-11 A participating candidate may not solicit, accept  or collect qualifying contributions within 
2 a voting place or on public property within 250 feet of the entrance to the voting place.  A 
3 payment, gift or anything of value may not be given in exchange  for a qualifying 
4 contribution.  A candidate may pay the fee for a money order that is a qualifying  
5 contribution in the amount  of $5 as long as the donor  making the qualifying contribution  
6 pays the $5 amount  reflected on the money order.  Any money order  fees paid by a 
7 participating candidate must be paid for with seed money and reported in accordance with 
8 commission rules.  A money order  must be signed by the contributor  to be a valid 
9 qualifying contribution.  The commission may establish  by routine technical rule, adopted 
10 in accordance with Title  5, chapter  375, subchapter 2-A, a procedure for a qualifying 
11 contribution to be made by a credit or debit transaction and by electronic  funds transfer 
12 over the Internet. Records containing information provided by individuals who have  
13 made qualifying contributions over the Internet are confidential, except  for the name of 
14 the individual  making  the contribution, the date of the contribution, the individual's 
15 residential address  and the name and office sought  of the candidate in whose support the 
16 contribution was made.
17 It is a violation of this chapter for a participating candidate or an agent of the participating 
18 candidate to misrepresent the purpose of soliciting qualifying contributions and obtaining  
19 the contributor's signed  acknowledgement.
20 SUMMARY
21 This bill prohibits the solicitation, acceptance or collection by a participating 
22 candidate under the Maine Clean Election  Act of seed money contributions or qualifying 
23 contributions within 250 feet of the entrance  to a voting place as well as within the voting 
24 place itself.
