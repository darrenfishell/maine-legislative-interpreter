15SUMMARY
16This bill makes changes to the laws governing dual liquor licenses.  It allows a 
17licensee to serve wine until 10 p.m., rather than until 8 p.m.  It removes the restriction 
18that wine may be served to be consumed on the premises only when accompanied by a 
19full meal and instead requires only that a full meal be available for purchase and 
20consumption.  It removes the requirement that a licensee have 2 employees at least 21 
21years of age present at all times in order to serve wine for on-premises consumption and 
22sell wine for off-premises consumption.
