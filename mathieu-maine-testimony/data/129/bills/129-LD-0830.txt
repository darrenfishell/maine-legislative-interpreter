25SUMMARY
26This bill establishes a minimum hourly wage for small employers that is less than the 
27minimum hourly wage for large employers.  Beginning October 1, 2019, for an employer 
28with fewer than 50 full-time employees in Maine, the minimum hourly wage is 
29established at $10; the minimum hourly wage for an employer of at least 50 full-time 
30employees in Maine remains at $11 until January 1, 2021, when it increases to $12.  This 
31bill also delays the  indexing of the minimum hourly wage for cost-of-living adjustments 
32by one year until 2022.
