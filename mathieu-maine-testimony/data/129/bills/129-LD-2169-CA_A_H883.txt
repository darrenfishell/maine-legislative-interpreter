35SUMMARY
36This amendment designates the provisions of the bill Part A and adds Part B, which 
37does the following.
38Section 1 corrects a conflict in the law concerning the definition of "original source" 
39in the lobbyist disclosure laws, and section 2 updates the use of the term "grassroots 
40lobbying", formerly known as "indirect lobbying", in the law concerning the reporting of 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to H.P. 1552, L.D. 2169
Page 3 - 129LR3217(02)-1
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT1grassroots lobbying efforts.  Section 7 sets an effective date of December 1, 2020 for both 
2of these amendments.
3Section 3 clarifies when state vehicles can be used for commuting.
4Sections 4, 5 and 6 correct 2 errors in the effective dates of Public Law 2019, chapter 
5154.  Section 4 enacts a new paragraph B-1 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, 
6section 802, subsection 4-B that contains the same language as the former paragraph B, 
7providing for religious and philosophical exemptions from immunization requirements 
8for employees of certain health care facilities, except that it contains a sunset of 
9September 1, 2021.  This was the intended repeal date of the exemption.  Because 
10paragraph B was repealed on April 20, 2020, the only way to reinstate the exemption is to 
11enact it as paragraph B-1. 
12Section 5 amends the effective date section of Public Law 2019, chapter 154 to 
13remove the reference to the amendment to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 
14802, subsection 4-B, paragraph A.  This results in the amendment to paragraph A, which 
15expands the categories of health care professionals who can sign a statement for a health 
16care employee about the medical inadvisability of an immunization, taking effect when 
17chapter 154 took effect.  The retroactivity language of section 6 makes this change take 
18effect on April 20, 2020, the effective date of chapter 154, so there is no gap in that date 
19and when this Act takes effect.  These changes are substantive changes.
