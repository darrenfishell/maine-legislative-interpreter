13 sole user of the energy produced by the solar array is the municipality or school 
14 administrative unit that entered into the agreement. 
15 It adds Part F, which requires the ConnectME Authority to establish a process to 
16 ensure state funds made available pursuant to the bond issue under Part B are used to
