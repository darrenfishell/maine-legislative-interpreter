employees based on existing turnover. Accordingly, the bill includes General Fund appropriations of $748 in fiscal 
year 2019-20 and $118 in fiscal year 2020-21 and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $1,216 in fiscal year 
2019-20 and $182 in fiscal year2020-21. 
Additional costs to the Depattment of Public Safety associated with performing background checks can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. Other Special Revenue Funds revenue will be increased by minor amounts not 
requiring any change to the budget.
