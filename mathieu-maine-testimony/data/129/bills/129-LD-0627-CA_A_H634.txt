tnJury to a person requires the disclosure, without delay, of location information 
concerning a specific person and that a warrant cannot be obtained in time to prevent the 
identified danger, and the possessor of the location information, in good faith, believes

Amend the bill by adding after section 15 the following: 
'Sec. 16. Right To Know Advisory Committee; warrants for tracking 
devices and content and location information. The Right To Know Advisory 
Committee shall review the law concerning the application for and issuance of search 
warrants authorizing the installation and monitoring of tracking devices and seeking 
content and location information under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 16, chapter 3, 
subchapters 9-A, 10 and 11 and shall make recommendations concerning the public's 
right to know aggregate information about warrants, including warrants in which the 
application for the warrant included a request for an order to waive notice of the issuance 
of the warrant. The Right To Know Advisory Committee shall include in its report 
submitted by January 15, 2020, pursuant to Title 1, section 411, subsection 10, a 
summary of its review and any recommendations.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
The bill adds a new subchapter on obtaining search warrants for tracking devices and 
makes changes to the laws governing access to content of and location information 
pertaining to portable electronic devices, including cellular telephones. 
This amendment clarifies the definition of "tracking device" to limit the defmition to 
those devices the primary purpose of which is to track a person or obj~ct and to provide 
that the defmition does not include the electronic devices covered by the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 16, chapter 3, subchapters 10 and 11. 
This amendment makes consistent the definition of "adverse result," used when 
requesting that notice not be provided when a warrant is issued, to include "immediate 
danger of death or serious physical injury to any person" and "seriously jeopardizing an 
investigation" but not including "other significantly detrimental consequence." The 
definition is used in the new subchapter on tracking devices as well as the existing 
subchapters on access to content and location information of electronic devices and the 
warrant procedure requirements for content and location information. 
The bill authorizes the court to issue a search warrant for the installation and 
monitoring of a tracking device and waive notice of the issuance of the warrant. This 
amendment directs the Right To Know Advisory Committee to review the law
