8 SUMMARY 
9 This amendment replaces the bill and provides a new title. The amendment amends 
10 the Maine Juvenile Code to provide that statements of a juvenile or of a juvenile's parents, 
11 guardian or legal custodian made during an informal adjustment or during a restorative 
12 justice program or made to a clinical provider during substance use disorder, sexual 
13 behavior or mental health assessment or treatment attended by the juvenile are not 
14 admissible in evidence during the State's case in chief at an adjudicatory hearing against 
15 that juvenile on a petition based on the same facts that caused the referral for informal 
16 adjustment, restorative justice, assessment or treatment. The amendment provides for 
17 similar protections in school disciplinary proceedings. The amendment adds a definition 
18 of "restorative justice program. 11 The amendment also retains the provision of the bill that 
19 removes a cross-reference to a provision of law regarding community resolution teams, 
20 which has been repealed.
