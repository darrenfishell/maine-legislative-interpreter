24 to the special restrictions on dissemination and use of the criminal history record

49 learns of the existence of the new criminal conviction, the court shall notify the person, at

58 criminal history record information relating to the criminal conviction as specified in 
59 section 2265 and shall issue a written order certifying this determination.  If, at the 
60 conclusion of the hearing, the court determines that the person has satisfied the burden of

62 written order certifying this determination.  The order must contain written findings of fact 
63 supporting the court's determination.  A copy of the court's written order must be provided 
64 to the person and the prosecutorial office that represented the State.

6SUMMARY
7 This amendment is a minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary.  It 
8 replaces the bill and replaces the special process to seal certain criminal records, found in 
9 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, chapter 310, that was repealed by its own terms on 
10 October 1, 2019.
11 This amendment uses the same process to seal criminal records of an eligible criminal 
12 conviction as in the repealed law.  This amendment defines "eligible criminal conviction" 
13 to include all current and former Class D and Class E crimes except for:
14 1.  Class D or Class E crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 11, Sexual Assaults;
15 2.  Class D or Class E crimes contained in Title 17-A, chapter 12, Sexual Exploitation 
16 of Minors;
17 3.  The Class D and Class E crimes of aggravated sex trafficking, sex trafficking and 
18 patronizing prostitution of a minor or a person with a mental disability;
19 4.  Stalking and domestic violence stalking;
20 5.  Any crime involving domestic violence, unless the sentence has been commuted;
21 6.  A crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since 
22 entry of the judgment of conviction;
23 7.  A conviction for a violation of a condition of release for a charge that involves a 
24 crime against a family or household member before 20 years have passed since entry of the 
25 judgment of conviction;
26 8.  A conviction for a violation of a protective order under Title 5, section 4659, 
27 subsection 2; Title 15, section 321, subsection 6; Title 17-A, section 506-B; Title 19-A, 
28 section 4011, subsection 3; or Title 19-A, section 4012, subsection 5;
29 9.  A conviction for cruelty to animals; and
30 10.  A conviction for endangering the welfare of a child.
31 A person with an eligible criminal conviction may file a motion for the restrictions on 
32 dissemination and use of criminal history record information for an eligible criminal 
33 conviction if at least 4 years have passed since the person fully satisfied each of the 
34 sentencing alternatives imposed for the conviction; the person has not been convicted of 
35 another criminal violation in this State, and has not had a criminal charge dismissed as a 
36 result of a deferred disposition, since satisfying the sentencing alternatives; the person has 
37 no criminal convictions in another jurisdiction since satisfying the sentencing alternatives; 
38 and the person has no presently pending criminal charges in this State or in another 
39 jurisdiction.
40 The court must hold a hearing on the motion and, if the court determines all the 
41 requirements have been met, the court must find the person entitled to the special 1

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “      ” to H.P. 581, L.D. 776
Page 7 - 129LR1202(03)
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT42 restrictions and issue a written order certifying the determination.  A copy of the order must 
43 be provided to the person and the prosecutorial office that prosecuted the person.  The order 
44 must also be provided to the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, State 
45 Bureau of Identification, which must promptly amend its records relating to the eligible 
46 criminal conviction.
6 If the person is convicted of a crime after the court's order, the new conviction 
7 extinguishes the entitlement.  The court is required to notify the person of the new 
8 conviction and offer an opportunity for a hearing to contest the fact of the new conviction.  
9 If the court determines that there is a new criminal conviction, the court must issue an order 
10 that the person is no longer eligible to have the criminal record sealed.  That order must be 
11 submitted to the State Bureau of Identification.
12 When a person's records are subject to the special restrictions on dissemination and 
13 use, the criminal history record information is confidential and may not be disseminated by 
14 a criminal justice agency to anyone except the following for limited purposes:  the person; 
15 a criminal justice agency; the Secretary of State; victims; the Department of Professional 
16 and Financial Regulation, Office of Securities; and financial institutions.
17 This amendment differs from the majority report in that it does not include language 
18 stating that the person whose conviction has been sealed will not be subject to sanctions 
19 for not disclosing the conviction.
20 The State may appeal as of right an order to seal a record; the person may appeal, but 
21 not as of right, when the court does not order the record sealed.
22 This amendment provides that the whole chapter is repealed October 1, 2025.
