Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill increases the revenue sharing rate from 2% to 5% in fiscal year 2018-19 retroactive to January 1, 2019. It 
would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of $49,941,123 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a corresponding 
increase in Local Government Fund revenue of $49 ,941, 123 in fiscal year 2018-19. This analysis is based on the 
December 2018 revenue forecast. There would be no fiscal impact in the following years since current law already has. 
revenue sharing returning to 5%.
