4any person who has a security interest, mortgage, lien, encumbrance or other interest 
5in the property that is properly recorded in the registry of deeds of the county in 
6which the property is located.  The lien arises and becomes perfected at the time the 
7notice is filed in the appropriate registry of deeds in accordance with this paragraph.  
8The lien constitutes a lien on all property with respect to which the owner receives 
9the credit and the proceeds of any disposition of the property that occurs after notice 
10to the owner of the repayment obligation.  The lien is prior to any mortgage and 
11security interest, lien, restrictive covenant or other encumbrance recorded, filed or 
12otherwise perfected after the notice of lien is filed in the appropriate registry of deeds.  
13The lien may be enforced by a turnover or sale order in accordance with Title 14,

26of buildings for new rental units of senior housing; and

30SUMMARY
31The purpose of this bill is to address Maine's shortage of safe, affordable housing by 
32creating a state affordable housing tax credit.  The tax credit is administered by the Maine 
33State Housing Authority, which will allocate the state credit through a process similar to 
34its current allocation of federal housing tax credits. Ten percent of the credit must be set 
35aside for the preservation of affordable housing units that are constructed with financial 
36assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural 
37Development, Rural Housing Service and at risk of losing their affordable status. In 
38addition, 30% of the credit allocated to new housing units is targeted for seniors and 20% 
39is targeted for rural areas. The credit is subject to reporting requirements and a process for 
40tax expenditure review by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
41Accountability.
