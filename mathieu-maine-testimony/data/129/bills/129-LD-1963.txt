24SUMMARY
25The purpose of this bill is to assist communities and financial institutions when a 
26home becomes abandoned by the property owner.  This bill allows, under specific 
27circumstances, a mortgagee or mortgage servicer to enter the property, secure the 
28property and prevent further deterioration.  This bill enhances the existing abandoned 
29property laws and provides specific procedures for mortgage servicers and their designees 
30to enter abandoned property for the purpose of abating an identified nuisance, preserving 
31property or preventing waste.  Mortgage servicers and their designees must post notices 
32on properties prior to entering them, and the notices must contain information about the 
33rights of the property owners and authorized occupants.  Mortgage servicers and their 
34designees may not enter property that is occupied.
