Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would change the date that state legislative candidates who are not enrolled in a political party must file to 
participate in the Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) from April 1st to June 1st. Any additional costs to the 
Commission on Govemmental Ethics and Election Practices as a result of this change are anticipated to be minor and 
can be absorbed with existing budgeted resources. Based on historical participation rates in the MCEA the change in 
dates will not have an impact on unenrolled candidates future participation rates.
