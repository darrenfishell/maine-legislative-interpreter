41.  Findings.  The Legislature finds that the lower Penobscot River is a unique and 
5valuable natural resource.  The lower Penobscot River serves as an example to the Nation 
6that good public policy carefully implemented can restore and preserve our natural 
7resources.  The river has supported, and is again beginning to support, the greatest run of 
8Atlantic salmon and 11 other species of anadromous fish in North America, providing a 
9unique fishing opportunity for Maine  residents and members of the Penobscot Indian 
10Nation.  The Legislature declares that the preservation and restoration of the lower 
11Penobscot River is of the highest priority.
122.  Prohibition.  To protect water quality and aquatic resources, fisheries and fishing 
13opportunities, and as an exercise of the public trust of the State, no person, firm, 
14corporation, municipality or other legal entity may erect, operate, maintain or use any 
15dam on that portion of the Penobscot River downstream from the Bangor Hydroelectric 
16Company Dam located at Veazie Milford Dam located between Milford and Old Town, 
17except that portion of the river known as the Stillwater Branch, to the southernmost point 
18of Verona Island for any purpose not previously authorized by act, resolve or operation of 
19law, unless specifically authorized by the Legislature.
203.  Study authorized.  Any person, firm, corporation, municipality or other legal 
21entity may study the feasibility of erecting, operating, maintaining or using a dam for 
22hydroelectric generation on the portion of the Penobscot River described in subsection 2.
23Sec. 2.  Study.  The Department of Marine Resources, the Department of Inland 
24Fisheries and Wildlife and the Department of Environmental Protection, referred to in 
25this section as "the departments," in consultation with the Penobscot Indian Nation and 
26interested federal agencies, shall conduct a comprehensive assessment of fish passage 
27barriers, water quality and habitat conditions affecting the full restoration of fisheries 
28within the Penobscot River watershed and the feasibility and costs of mitigating 
29problems.  The departments shall report to the Joint Standing Committee on Marine 
30Resources, the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Joint 
31Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources on the subject matter of their 
32assessment by January 15, 2020.  The joint standing committees may report out 
33legislation relating to the departments' reports to the Second Regular Session of the 129th
