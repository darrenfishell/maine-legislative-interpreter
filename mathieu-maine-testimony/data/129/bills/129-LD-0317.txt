6appointed by the Governor, subject to review by the joint standing committee of the 
7Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters and to confirmation by the Legislature. 
8The Governor, in making appointments, shall name one member and 2 alternates to 
9represent employees, one member and 2 alternates to represent employers and one 
10member and 2 alternates to represent the public.  The member and alternates representing 
11employees may not have worked in a management capacity or represented management 
12interests in any proceedings at any time during the prior 10 years.  The member and 
13alternates representing the public may not have worked in a management capacity or 
14represented management interests in any proceedings or have worked for a labor 
15organization or served in a leadership role in a labor organization at any time during the 
16prior 10 years. The member representing the public serves as the board's chair and the 
17alternate representing the public serves as an alternate chair. Members of the board are 
18entitled to compensation according to the provisions of Title 5, chapter 379. The 
19alternates are entitled to compensation at the same per diem rate as the member that the 
20alternate replaces. The term of each member and each alternate is 4 years, except that of 
21the members and alternates first appointed, one member and 2 alternates are appointed for 
22a term of 4 years, one member and 2 alternates are appointed for a term of 3 years and 
23one member and 2 alternates are appointed for a term of 2 years. The members of the 
24board, its alternates and its employees are entitled to receive necessary expenses. Per 
25diem and necessary expenses for members and alternates of the board, as well as state 
26cost allocation program charges, must be shared equally by the parties to any proceeding 
27at which the board presides and must be paid into a special fund administered by the 
28board from which all costs must be paid.  The executive director may estimate costs upon 
29receipt of a request for services and collect those costs prior to providing the services.  
30The executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties, as appropriate, for any 
31difference between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of 
32providing the services.  Once one party has paid its share of the estimated cost of 
33providing the service, the matter is scheduled for hearing.  A party who has not paid an 
34invoice for the estimated or actual cost of providing services within 60 days of the date 
35the invoice was issued is, in the absence of good cause shown, liable for the amount of 
36the invoice together with a penalty in the amount of 25% of the amount of the invoice.  
37Any penalty amount collected pursuant to this provision remains in the special fund 
38administered by the Maine Labor Relations Board, and that fund does not lapse.  The 
39executive director is authorized to collect any sums due and payable pursuant to this 
40provision through civil action.  In such an action, the court shall allow litigation costs, 
41including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, to be deposited in the General Fund 
42if the executive director is the prevailing party in the action.  At its discretion, the board 
43may allocate all costs to a party that presents a frivolous complaint or defense or that 
44commits a blatant violation of the applicable collective bargaining law.  When the board 
45meets on administrative or other matters that do not concern the interests of particular 
Page 2 - 129LR1013(01)-11parties or when any board member presides at a prehearing conference, the members' per 
2diem and necessary expenses must be paid from the board's regular appropriation for 
3these purposes.  The executive director and legal or professional personnel employed by 
4the board are members of the unclassified service.
