COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "fl" to H.P. 1336, L.D. 1865, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Protection from Abuse Laws Concerning Consent Agreements" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in subsection 1 by striking out all of the first paragraph 
(page 1, lines 4 to 13 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'1. Protection order; consent agreement. The court, after a hearing and upon 
finding that the defendant has committed the alleged abuse as defined in section 4002, 
subsection 1 or engaged in the alleged conduct described in section 4005, subsection 1,

a&use-:-Alternatively, when the parties voluntarily request a consent agreement, the court 
may grant a protective order with or without a finding that the defendant committed abuse 
as defined in section 4002, subsection 1 or with or without a finding that the defendant 
engaged in conduct described in section 4005, subsection 1. The court may enter a 
finding that the defendant represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the plaintiff 
or a minor child residing in the plaintiffs household. The court may enter a finding of 
economic abuse. Relief granted under this section may include:' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that a court may grant a protection from abuse order 
without holding a hearing if the patties have voluntarily requested a consent agreement. 
The court may enter the protective order based on the consent agreement with or without 
a finding that the defendant engaged in abuse. If the protection from abuse order is 
granted to stop alleged conduct described in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, 
section 4005, subsection 1, it may be granted with or without a finding that the alleged 
conduct occurred. Current law is silent on the issue of a protection from abuse order 
when the patties request a consent agreement based on alleged conduct, as opposed to 
abuse.
