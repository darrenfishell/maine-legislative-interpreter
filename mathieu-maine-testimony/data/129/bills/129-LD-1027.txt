4SUMMARY
5This bill removes the 100-megawatt capacity limit for a hydroelectric generator that 
6meets all state and federal fish passage requirements applicable to generators to qualify as 
7a renewable capacity resource and for a hydroelectric generator to qualify as a renewable 
8resource for the purpose of meeting the State's renewable resource portfolio requirement.
