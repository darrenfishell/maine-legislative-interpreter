SUMMARY 
2 This amendment amends the bill by changing the crime of domestic violence 
3 aggravated assault to create the Class A variant of aggravated assault that is consistent 
4 with the existing crime of Class A aggravated assault under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
5 Title 17-A section 208, subsection 1, paragraph A-1, when the defendant causes bodily 
6 injmy to another that causes serious, permanent disfigurement or loss or substantial 
7 impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ. The amendment adds the 
8 newly created crimes of domestic violence aggravated assault, domestic violence elevated 
9 aggravated assault and domestic violence elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant 
10 person to the predicates that may be used to elevate existing domestic violence crimes. 
11 The amendment also adds reference to the newly created crimes of domestic violence 
12 aggravated assault, domestic violence elevated aggravated assault and domestic violence 
13 elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person to the definition of "family or household 
14 members" under Title 19-A, chapter 101, which concerns protection from abuse. The 
15 amendment makes one nonsubstantive, grammatical correction to the provision of the bill 
16 on repeat violations under the protection from abuse law. The amendment adds the 
17 newly created crimes of domestic violence aggravated assault, domestic violence elevated 
18 aggravated assault and domestic violence elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant 
19 person to the mandat01y arrest provisions of Title 19-A, section 4012, subsection 5 and 
20 repeals reference to a violation of Title 17-A, section 208 that has occurred between 
21 members of the same family or household as unnecessary following inclusion in the 
22 subsection of the newly created crimes.

Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
The bill establishes new Class A and B crimes regarding domestic violence aggravated assault. These new crimes are 
variants of existing aggravated assault crimes which have the same class and no additional costs are anticipated from 
these provisions. 
The bill also adds these newly created domestic violence aggravated assault crimes to the predicates that may elevate 
a Class D crime of domestic violence to a Class C crime. The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services has 
indicated that this could increase costs to the commission by minor amounts in future biennia. The elevation of a 
Class D crime to a Class C will increase costs to the Department of Conections (DOC) since Class D sentences are 
served in county jails and Class Care longer and are served in state facilities. Each conviction elevated to a Class C 
costs DOC $44,106 for a one year sentence. 
Also, the bill establishes a new Class C crime for a person who violates a protection from abuse order for the third 
time. In fiscal year 2017-18 there were 797 charges for violations of protective orders brought in 720 cases, indicating 
that some cases include more than one violation. Again, each Class C conviction costs DOC $44, 106 for a one year 
sentence. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed does not require additional funding at 
this time for the courts. The collection of additional fine revenue will increase General Fund and dedicated revenue by 
minor amounts.
