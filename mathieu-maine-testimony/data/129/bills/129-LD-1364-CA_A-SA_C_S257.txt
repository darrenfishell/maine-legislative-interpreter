SUMMARY 
This amendment def mes and uses the term "broadband Internet access service," 
which is the term the Federal Communications Commission uses in its net neutrality 
order, to refer to Internet services. The amendment modifies the definitions of the terms 
"paid prioritization" and "throttling" to be consistent with the Federal Communications 
Commission's net neutrality order. The amendment also clarifies that net neutrality 
continues to allow Internet service providers, consistent with the Federal 
Communications Commission's net neutrality order, to address copyright infringement or 
other illegal activity and to address the needs of public safety and law enforcement as 
permitted by law or the provider's ability to do so. This amendment incorporates the 
provisions of House Amendment "A" to Committee Amendment "A."
