20the expiration of a first, 2nd or 3rd year probationary teacher's contract, the 
21superintendent shall notify the teacher in writing of the superintendent's decision to 
22nominate or not nominate that teacher for another teaching contract.  If, after receiving a 
23complaint from a teacher, the commissioner finds that the superintendent has failed to

25shall pay a forfeiture to the teacher.  The amount of that forfeiture must be equal to the 
26teacher's per diem salary rate times the number of days between the notification deadline
