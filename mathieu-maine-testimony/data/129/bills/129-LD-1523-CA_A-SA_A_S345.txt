This amendment strikes the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services to enter 
into a contract with a third party to certify recovery residences from the bill. The department is currently entering into 
a contract to accomplish this and will fund it with federal funds received from the Maine State Opioid Response 
federal award. Other provisions of the bill may still be needed.
