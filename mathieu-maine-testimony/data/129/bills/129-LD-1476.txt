3repealed.
4Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §2532, as amended by PL 2017, c. 191, §2, is further 
5amended to read:
6§2532.  Referendum recount procedure
7In the case of a referendum, a recount must be granted upon written application of 
810% or 100, whichever is less, of the registered voters in the municipality.  The 
9application must designate a contact person, with the person's mailing address, residential 
10address and telephone number, who is to be considered the official representative of those 
11registered voters with regard to the referendum.  The time limits, rules and all other 
12matters applying to candidates under section 2531-B apply equally to applicants for the 
13recount.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the method of conducting a 
14referendum recount is governed by Title 21-A, section 737-A.  An official representative 
15from the opposing side of a referendum issue is determined by the first submittal of an 
16affidavit signed by 10 registered voters in the municipality.
171.  Date of recount and notice.  When the application for a recount is filed, the 
18municipal clerk shall immediately set a date for the recount, which must be held within 5 
19business days after the application is filed.  The municipal clerk shall notify the municipal 
20officers and the opposing official representative of the recount date.
212.  Procedure at recount.  The municipal clerk shall publicly sort and facilitate the 
22counting of the votes.  All recounts must be conducted by a hand recount, with counters 
23who may be provided by the official representatives.  The number of required counters to 
24facilitate a hand count must be determined by the municipal clerk.  To whatever extent 
25possible, when counters are provided by both opposing sides, each counter must be paired 
26with a counter from the opposing side.  If no counters are provided, the municipal clerk 
27may secure election officials to conduct the hand recount.
28All election materials in any way involved in the election and all records required by law 
29to be kept in connection with the election must be available for inspection.
30Disputed ballots may be resolved by the official representatives or their legal 
31representatives.  If both opposing sides do not have an official representative or legal 
32representative designated, disputed ballots must remain unresolved.  Unresolved disputed 
33ballots or challenged ballots may not be included in the recount and must be segregated 
34and secured with other voted ballots.  If the number of unresolved disputed or challenged 
35ballots affects the result of the recount, the matter must be sent to the Supreme Judicial 
36Court in accordance with Title 21-A, section 737-A, subsection 10.
373.  Packages resealed and marked.  After the recount, the municipal clerk shall 
38reseal the packages of ballots and the incoming voting lists and shall note the fact and 
39date of the recount on them.
Page 2 - 129LR1892(01)-114.  Certificate of election.  Within 24 hours after the results of a recounted 
2referendum are determined, the municipal clerk shall certify the results of the recount to 
3the respective official representatives involved and issue a certificate of election.  This 
4certificate of election supersedes any certificate issued previously.
5SUMMARY
6This bill repeals the law governing a candidate's inspection of ballots and incoming 
7voting lists and amends the law governing the referendum recount procedure to provide 
8for establishing official representatives of both sides of a referendum issue, determining 
9the date of the recount, the hand recount of votes, the availability of election materials for 
10inspection, the resolution of disputed ballots, the resealing of recounted ballots and 
11certification of the election results.
