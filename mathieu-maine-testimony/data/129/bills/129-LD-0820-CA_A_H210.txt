Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The bill provides coverage to MaineCare members for legal abortion services. It is estimated that the annual costs to 
the Department of Health and Human Services of covering abortions in MaineCare would be $375,000 of General 
Fund dollars with no Federal Expenditures Fund allocations, as these services are not eligible for federal match. This 
bill provides no new funding. The impact of these new unfunded costs on other programs in the DHHS cannot be 
determined at this time. 
The state employee health plan and the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation do not anticipate any 
additional costs as a result of this bill.
