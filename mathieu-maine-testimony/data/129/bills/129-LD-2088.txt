20SUMMARY
21This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal 
22Affairs pursuant to Resolve 2019, chapter 15.  The committee has not taken a position on 
23the substance of the bill and by reporting this bill out the committee is not suggesting and 
24does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with any aspect of this bill.  The 
25committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of obtaining a printed bill that can 
26be referred to the committee for a public hearing and subsequent committee action in the 
27normal course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in 
28the legislative review of the proposal.
29This bill consolidates in one section the separate laws prohibiting financial 
30relationships between entities within the 3-tier system of alcohol distribution in Maine.  
31The bill clarifies that, with only a few minor exceptions, an entity in the manufacturer 
32tier, wholesaler tier or retailer tier may not have a financial interest, direct or indirect, in 
33an entity in a different tier of the 3-tier system.  Unlike current law, the bill clarifies that 
34these so-called 3-tier prohibitions apply to entities that sell spirits.  The bill also preserves 
35the prohibition in current law against an in-state wholesaler of malt liquor and wine, 
36referred to in current law as a wholesale licensee, having any financial interest, direct or 
37indirect, in an out-of-state wholesaler of malt liquor or wine whose products are imported 
38into the State.
