$0 $0 $0 
At the close of fiscal year 2015-16 $13,400,000 was transferred from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund 
to the Cost Recovery Fund at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to pay above-market costs of ce1tain biomass 
contracts. This bill moves any money remaining from that transfer that is determined by the PUC to not be needed for 
the original purpose to be credited to the newly created Wood Energy Fund within the Efficiency Maine Trust 
(EMT). The PUC has determined that $5,461,388 is available to be directed into the Wood Energy Fund. 
The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the Wood Energy Fund within the EMT of $5,461,388 
in fiscal year 2019-20 to provide incentives and low or no-interest loans for new wood-derived thermal energy or 
co generation projects. Additional costs to the Finance Authority of Maine to consult with the EMT in the 
development of program incentives and distribution of funds from the wood energy fund can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
