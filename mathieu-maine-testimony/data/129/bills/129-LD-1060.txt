2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §102, sub-§20-B, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 398, Pt. A, §9 
3and affected by §§104 and 105, is amended to read:
420-B.  Transmission and distribution utility.  "Transmission and distribution 
5utility" means a person, its lessees, trustees or receivers or trustees appointed by a court, 
6owning, controlling, operating or managing a transmission and distribution plant for 
7compensation within the State, except where the electricity is distributed by the entity that 
8generates the electricity through private property alone solely for that entity's own use or 
9the use of the entity's tenants or the use of a consumer located adjacent to the entity and 
10not otherwise offered for sale to others.  For purposes of this subsection, "adjacent" has 
11the same meaning as defined by the commission by rule pursuant to section 2102, 
12subsection 5.
13Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §2102, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
145.  Exemption for certain private electric facilities.  The provisions of this section 
15do not apply to the construction of a transmission line, together with all associated 
16equipment and facilities, that is constructed, owned and operated by a generator of 
17electricity solely for the purpose of electrically and physically interconnecting that 
18generator to a consumer of the electricity who is located adjacent, as defined by the 
19commission by rule, to the generator.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are 
20routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
21Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub-§1-B, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 148, §2, is 
22amended to read:
231-B.  Exception; generator interconnection transmission facility.  The 
24construction of a generator interconnection transmission facility is not subject to the 
25requirements of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, "generator 
26interconnection transmission facility" means a transmission line, together with all 
27associated equipment and facilities, that is constructed, owned and operated by a 
28generator of electricity solely for the purpose of electrically and physically 
29interconnecting such generator either to the transmission system of a transmission and 
30distribution utility or to a consumer of the electricity located adjacent to the generator.  
31For purposes of this subsection, "adjacent" has the same meaning as defined by the 
32commission by rule pursuant to section 2102, subsection 5.
33SUMMARY
34This bill allows an electricity generator to build an interconnection from the 
35generator's facility to a consumer of the electricity located adjacent to the generator 
36without becoming subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission as a 
37transmission and distribution utility.   The Public Utilities Commission is directed to 
38adopt rules to determine when a consumer is located adjacent to a generator.
