Page 1 - 129LR1421(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  Reduction in early retirement penalty for certain state employees 
3and teachers.  Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 17852, 
4subsection 3-A or any other provision of law to the contrary, the reduction in the 
5retirement benefit for a qualified member is 2.25% for each year that the qualified 
6member's age precedes 62 years of age at retirement.
7As used in this section, "qualified member" means a member of the Maine Public 
8Employees Retirement System who:
91. Retired from service as a state employee between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 
10or as a teacher between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2012;
112.  Had completed 25 or more years of creditable service upon retirement;
123.  Had neither 10 years of creditable service nor had reached 60 years of age with 
13one year of creditable service immediately before July 1, 1993; and
144.  Had not attained 62 years of age as of retirement from service as a state employee 
15or teacher.
16As used in this section, the terms "creditable service," "employee," "member," 
17"retirement," "retirement benefit," "state employee" and "teacher" have the same meaning 
18as in Title 5, section 17001.
19SUMMARY
20Under changes made to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System in 1993, 
21employees who were members of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System as of 
22July 1, 1993 but did not have 10 years of creditable service as of July 1, 1993 are required 
23to have 25 years of creditable service and attain 62 years of age in order to avoid 
24incurring a penalty of 6% of earned benefits for each year the person retires before 
25attaining 62 years of age.  Prior to that change, the penalty was 2.25% for each year 
26below 60 years of age the person retired.
27This bill changes the rate of the penalty for those state employees who retired 
28between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2012 and for teachers who retired between July 1, 
292011 and July 1, 2012 who had at least 25 years of service on July 1, 2011 but had not 
30attained 62 years of age to 2.25% for each year the person was below 62 years of age 
31upon retirement from service.
