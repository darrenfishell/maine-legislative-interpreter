STATE OF MAINE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
129TH LEGISLATURE 
FffiST REGULAR SESSION 
HOUSE AMENJJMENT ·A "to COMMITTEE AMENJJMENT "A" to H.P. 1295, 
L.D. 1818, Bill, "An Act To Clarify and Enhance Certain Maine Wildlife Laws" 
Amend the amendment by inserting after the title the following: 
'Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the provisions of this Act need to become effective before 90 days after 
the adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature in order for changes 
to laws goveming the hunting of moose to take effect and to provide time to educate 
hunters on these new provisions prior to the first hunt occurring in September 2019; and 
Whereas, chronic wasting disease has been detected in a captive deer farm in the 
Province of Quebec, not far from the Maine border, and it is yet to be determined if this 
disease has reached wild deer populations and, due to the devastating impact this disease 
has on wild deer and moose populations and the potential significant negative impact this 
disease would have on Maine's economy, hunting traditions and people's livelihoods, 
clear authority to allow the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to act 
decisively to protect Maine's moose and deer populations from chronic wasting disease is 
immediately necessary; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' ' 
Amend the amendment after section 2 by inserting the following: 
'Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.''
