Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Effective September 1, 2021, this bill repeals the requirements that measurements of student learning and growth be 
significant factors in performance evaluations and professional growth systems for teachers and principals and that 
certain state assessment growth data be used as at least one measure of performance for teachers and principals. The 
required use of state assessment growth data as a perf01mance measure was pait of statut01y changes made in Public 
Law 2015, chapter 3 to address compliance concerns with the Elementary and Seconda1y Education Act (ESEA) of 
1965 that could have resulted in the loss of certain federal funds had those concerns not been addressed. With the 
passage of the Eve1y Student Succeeds Act, which reauthorized the ESEA, the federal requirements for educator 
evaluation and support systems went away. Given that change, passage of this bill will not put receipt of federal 
funds at risk. 
This legislation requires the Department of Education to amend it rules to implement these changes. Additional costs 
to the department associated with the rulemaking process can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
