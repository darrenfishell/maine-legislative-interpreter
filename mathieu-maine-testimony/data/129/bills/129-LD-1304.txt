6E.  The court may require the juvenile to make restitution in an amount no greater 
7than $800 for any damage to the a victim or other authorized claimant as 
8compensation for economic loss upon reasonable conditions that the court determines

10an amount that the juvenile can reasonably pay while under commitment to a secure 
11facility or under conditions of release, conditions of a deferred disposition agreement, 
12conditions of a filing agreement or conditions of probation. Prior to ordering

14the juvenile's ability to pay pursuant to Title 17-A, section 1325, subsection 4.  A 
15court may order a juvenile to perform court-approved community service to satisfy 
16any restitution required by the court.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the 
17provisions of Title 17-A, chapter 54 apply, except that section Title 17-A, sections 
181326-B, 1326-E, 1326-F, 1329 does and 1330-C do not apply.  Enforcement of a 
19restitution order is available pursuant to subsection 7.  If the restitution was a 
20condition of probation, the attorney for the State may, with written consent of the 
21juvenile community corrections officer, file a motion to revoke modify probation.
22Sec. 3.  15 MRSA §3314, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2009, c. 608, §2, is further 
23amended to read:
247.  Enforcement of a dispositional order.  After To enforce a dispositional order 
25following an adjudication for a juvenile crime, after notice and hearing and in accordance 
26with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 66, the court may exercise its inherent 
27contempt power by way of a plenary contempt proceeding involving punitive sanctions, 
28accompanied or unaccompanied by remedial sanctions, to enforce the disposition ordered 
29following an adjudication for a juvenile crime or to enforce any order requiring the 
30appearance of a juvenile before the court.  Any confinement imposed as a punitive or 
31remedial sanction upon a person who has not attained 18 years of age may not exceed 30 
32days and must be served in a facility approved or operated by the Department of 
33Corrections exclusively for juveniles.  Any confinement imposed as a punitive or 
34remedial sanction upon a person who has attained 18 years of age, if to be served in a 
35facility approved or operated by the Department of Corrections exclusively for juveniles, 
36may not exceed 30 days.  To enforce the disposition ordered following an adjudication 
37for a juvenile crime defined in section 3103, subsection 1, paragraph B or C upon a 
38person who has not attained 18 years of age, the court shall, at the time of the disposition, 
39provide written notice to the juvenile of the court's authority to enforce the dispositional 
40order through an exercise of its inherent contempt power and that a contempt order could 
41include an order of confinement for up to 30 days as a punitive sanction and for up to 30 
42days as a remedial sanction.  Except as explicitly set out in this subsection, nothing in this 
43subsection affects the court's ability to exercise its contempt powers for persons who have 
Page 2 - 129LR1231(01)-11attained 18 years of age except that the court may not order confinement or impose an 
2additional monetary penalty as either a punitive or remedial sanction.  Upon a motion by 
3the State to enforce the payment of restitution or a fine, the court may order as a punitive 
4or remedial sanction that a juvenile subject to the provisions of this subsection earn credit 
5against a fine or restitution owed by completing court-approved community service at an 
6hourly rate set by the court that may be no less than the minimum wage established in 
7Title 26, section 664. In making an order to enforce the payment of restitution or a fine 
8under this subsection, the court may not consider whether the juvenile was found to have 
9excusably or inexcusably failed to comply with the court order.
10In addition to the contempt powers described in this subsection, upon a default in 
11payment of a fine or restitution, execution may be levied and other measures authorized 
12for the collection of unpaid civil judgments may be taken to collect the unpaid fine or 
13restitution.  A levy of execution does not discharge a juvenile confined as a punitive 
14sanction and does not discharge a juvenile confined as a remedial sanction until the full 
15amount of the fine or restitution has been paid.
16SUMMARY
17This bill amends the Maine Juvenile Code concerning the payment of restitution and 
18fines in the following ways:
191.  It removes from the consideration of withholding an institutional disposition 
20following the adjudication of a juvenile crime the juvenile’s ability or agreement to make 
21restitution for a victim's damages or injuries;
222.  It caps the amount of restitution a juvenile may be ordered to pay at $800, requires 
23the court to hold a hearing to determine the juvenile’s financial capacity and allows the 
24court to order community service in place of restitution; and
253.  Regarding a contempt proceeding concerning the enforcement of a dispositional 
26order following the adjudication of a juvenile crime, the bill removes the ability of a court 
27to incarcerate a juvenile or to levy execution of the monetary penalty or restitution to be 
28collected as an unpaid civil judgment.  The bill authorizes the court as a punitive or 
29remedial sanction for the nonpayment of the restitution or fine to require the juvenile to 
30earn credit by court-approved community service, which must be at a rate no less than the 
31state minimum wage without considering whether the nonpayment was excusable or 
32inexcusable.
