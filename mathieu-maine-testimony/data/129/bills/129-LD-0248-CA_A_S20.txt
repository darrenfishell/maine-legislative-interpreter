has entered into a commingling agreement. 
B. In addition to the payment of the refund value, the initiator of the deposit under 
section 3103, subsection 3 shall reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for 
the cost of handling beverage containers subject to section 3103 in an amount that 
equals at least 3 ¢ per returned container for containers picked up by the initiator 
before March 1, 2004, at least 3 1/2¢ for containers picked up on or after March 1, 
2004 and before March 1, 2010 aruli at least 4¢ for containers picked up on or after

C. The reimbursement that the initiator of the deposit is obligated to pay the dealer or 
redemption center pursuant to paragraph A or B must be reduced by 1/2¢ for any 
returned container that is subject to a qualified commingling agreement that allows 
the dealer or redemption center to commingle beverage containers of like product 
group, material and size. A commingling agreement is qualified for purposes of this 
paragraph if the department determines that 50% or more of the beverage containers 
of like product group, material and size for which the deposits are being initiated in 
the State are covered by the commi:p.gling agreement or that the initiators of deposit 
covered by the commingling agreement are initiators of deposit for wine containers 
who each sell no more than 100,000 gallons of wine or 500,000 beverage containers 
that contain wine in a calendar year. Once the initiator of deposit has established a 
qualified commingling agreement for containers of a like product group, material and 
size, the department shall allow additional brands to be included from a different 
product group if they are of like material. The State, through the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
Operations, shall make every reasonable effort to enter into a qualified commingling 
agreement under this paragraph with every other initiator of deposit for beverage 
containers that are of like product group, size and material as the beverage containers 
for which the State is the initiator of.deposit.

than 50,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more 
than 250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product. In

3103, subsections 1 to 4 who is also a brewer who annually produces no more than 
50,000 gallons of its product or a hottler of water who annually sells no more than 
250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product shall 
reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for the cost of handling beverage 
containers subject to section 3103 in an amount that equals at least 3¢ per returned 
container, except that, beginning May 1, 2019, the initiator of deposit shall reimburse 
the dealer or local redemption center at least 3 1/2¢ per returned container and,

This bill would increase the cost of handling reimbursement paid per returned beverage container by the initiator of 
deposit to dealers and local redemption centers under the state bottle redemption program by half a cent beginning 
May 1, 2019 and by another half a cent beginning January 1, 2020. Since the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and 
Lottery Operations (BABLO) functions as the initiator of deposit for all spirits sold in Maine, the increase in 
reimbursement would require an additional allocation from the Alcoholic Beverages Fund of $19,044 in fiscal year 
2019-20 and $181,414 in fiscal year 2020-21. Because the bottle redemption program and any payments required by 
the initiator of deposit is included in the spirits administration contract with Pine State Trading Company, this change 
will require the contract to be renegotiated. 
It is anticipated that the Alcoholic Beverages Fund will have sufficient revenue to fund the additional allocation for 
the foreseeable future. However, additional expenditures from the fund may put required future payments to, the 
Maine Municipal Bond Banlc at risk.
