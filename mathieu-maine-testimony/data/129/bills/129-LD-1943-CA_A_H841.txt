13 'Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §2602-A, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1991, c. 499, §3 and 
14 affected by §26, is further amended to read:
152.  Fees.  The Except as provided in subsection 3, the department shall charge the 
16 average cost of the analysis for an examination, testing or analysis of private residential 
17 water supplies requested under this chapter.  These fees must be recalculated and deposited 
18 according to section 565, subsection 3 and section 568, provided except that the fee charged 
19 for testing a private residential water supply may not exceed $150 when:
20 A.  In the opinion of the department, initial testing or screening performed at the 
21 expense of the owner indicates the need for additional testing at a cost in excess of 
22 $150 to determine whether that water supply contains contaminants potentially 
23 hazardous to human health and that additional testing is essential to the maintenance 
24 of public health; or
25 B.  In the opinion of the department, there is reason to suspect that a private residential 
26 water supply may be affected by contamination potentially hazardous to human health 
27 and that additional testing is essential to the maintenance of public health.  In making 
28 such a determination, the department shall consider the following:
29 (1)  The proximity of the private residential water supply to a known or suspected 
30 source of contamination;
31 (2)  The proximity of the private residential water supply to another private well or 
32 water supply known to be contaminated;
33 (3)  Information provided in writing to the department by a physician who has seen 
34 or treated a person and who has identified contaminated drinking water as a 
35 possible cause of the person's condition or symptoms; or

22 water well.  The fees collected must be credited to the Private Well Safe Drinking Water 
23 Fund established in section 2660-W and used for the purpose of increasing testing of 
24 residential private drinking water wells.  If more than one test of a water sample from the 
25 same residential private drinking water well is conducted, the department may waive
