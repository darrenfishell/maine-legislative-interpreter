13of such a commutation have been evaluated by a qualified health actuary who is a 
14member of the American Academy of Actuaries and has certified that the aggregate value 
15of reserves to be recaptured are reasonably adequate to discharge the insured's expected 
16liability for future costs of the health benefits covered by the excess policy.
