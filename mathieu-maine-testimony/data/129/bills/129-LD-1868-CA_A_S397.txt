17 SUMMARY 
18 The bill requires a lobbyist to report expenditures by a client for grassroots lobbying 
19 if those expenditures exceed $2,000 in a month. This amendment, which is the majority 
20 report of the committee, clarifies that a lobbyist must report on grassroots lobbying if the 
21 lobbyist's client either made or incurred expenditures in excess of $2,000 during a month 
22 for the purposes of grassroots lobbying. As amended, the grassroots lobbying reporting 
23 threshold for lobbyists will match the grassroots lobbying reporting threshold established 
24 in the bill for persons who have not engaged a lobbyist. The amendment also clarifies 
25 that the $2,000 threshold does not apply to the employer's regular employees.
