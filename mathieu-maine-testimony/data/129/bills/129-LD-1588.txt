14SUMMARY
15Current law exempts private homes, when not more than 5 rooms are let in that home, 
16and cottages and rooms, when not more than 3 rooms or cottages are let, from licensing 
17as a lodging place. This bill retains that exemption from licensing for such places, but 
18considers them vacation rentals and requires the owner of a vacation rental to register the 
19vacation rental with the Department of Health and Human Services and obtain a permit. 
20The permit is issued on an annual basis for a fee of no more than $50.  The department is 
21required to establish and maintain a vacation rental registry.  A vacation rental is defined 
22in current law as a residential property that is rented for vacation, leisure or recreation 
23purposes for a day, a week or a month, and typically under 30 days but not for more than 
24an entire summer or winter season, to a person who has a place of permanent residence to 
25which the person intends to return.
26This bill also makes nonsubstantive grammatical changes to reflect current drafting 
27standards.
