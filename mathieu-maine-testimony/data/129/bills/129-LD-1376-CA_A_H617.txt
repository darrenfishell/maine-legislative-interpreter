26 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 997, L.D. 1376 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill. The amendment directs schools to submit annual reports to the Department of 
Education regarding incidents of physical restraint and seclusion including the number of 
uses and number of students, broken down by grade level or age group, gender, race and 
type of education plan, and the number of injuries to students and to staff and directs the 
Commissioner of Education to report biennially to the Governor and the Legislature on 
data regarding the use of physical restraint and seclusion. 
The amendment also directs the Department of Education to, by rule, develop and 
implement a performance review system to define and monitor all schools' use of 
physical restraint and seclusion. 
The amendment also requires the Department of Education to submit major 
substantive rules by December 5, 2019, provide guidance to schools regarding these rules 
and submit a plan by January 15, 2020 to the Joint Standing Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs on professional development opportunities to promote preventive 
practice models that will reduce dependence on physical restraint and seclusion. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section. 
This amendment also incorporates a fiscal note. The fiscal note identifies the 
requirement that school administrative units break down the aggregate data by grade level 
or age group, gender, race and type of plan as a potential unfunded state mandate. 
Because schools are already required to collect this data pursuant to department rule 
Chapter 33: Rule Governing Physical Restraint and Seclusion, the committee finds this 
additional requirement does not require an expansion or modification of activities so as to 
necessitate additional expenditures.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $121,086 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $98,246 in fiscal year 
2020-21 to the Learning Systems Team program within the Department of Education. Of this amount, $50,000 is 
appropriated on a one-time basis for the programming costs to modify the current physical restraint and seclusion 
form in the department's educational information system to accept the data on physical restraint and seclusion by 
grade level or age level, gender, race and type of plan. Ongoing appropriations of $71,086 in fiscal year 2019-20 and 
$98,246 in fiscal year 2020-21 are provided to the Learning Systems Team program for one Education Specialist II 
position and related All Other costs to manage the required data submitted by each covered entity and to monitor 
incidents of physical restraint and seclusion and investigate incidents as necessary. 
School administrative units (SAU's) are required by department rule (Chapter 33: Rule Governing Physical Restraint 
and Seclusion) to rep01t the aggregate data listed above each year. This legislation places the requirement in statute 
and requires that the information be reported by grade level or age level, gender, race and type of plan. To the extent 
that SAU's already collect and report the required data, the additional cost of the required municipal activities may be 
minimal.
