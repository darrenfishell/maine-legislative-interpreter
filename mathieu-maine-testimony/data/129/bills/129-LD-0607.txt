16SUMMARY
17This bill allows a deduction from Maine individual and corporate taxable income for 
18the federal tax credit allowed to an employer for the employer's share of federal social 
19security taxes paid on the portion of an employee's tips that cause the employee's wages 
20to exceed $5.15 per hour.  Under federal tax law, the credit amount must be subtracted 
21from the taxpayer's otherwise deductible expenses, which increases federal taxable 
22income.  Under current Maine law, when an employer takes the credit available under the 
23federal Internal Revenue Code, the employer receives neither a Maine credit nor a return 
24of the federal disallowed deduction for Maine taxable income purposes; such a deduction 
25is allowed from Maine taxable income for the work opportunity credit and empowerment 
26zone employment credit.  This bill makes Maine's treatment consistent across the 3 
27federal credits.
