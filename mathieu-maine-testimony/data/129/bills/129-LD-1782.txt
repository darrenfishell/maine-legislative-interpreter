10SUMMARY
11This bill amends the motorcycle rider education laws to clarify that a person who 
12completes a motorcycle rider education course approved by the Secretary of State on a 2-
13wheel motorcycle may operate a 2-wheel or 3-wheel motorcycle and that a person who 
14completes a motorcycle rider education course approved by the Secretary of State on a 3-
15wheel motorcycle may only operate a 3-wheel motorcycle.  A person who holds a 
16motorcycle learner's permit and who completes a motorcycle road test administered by 
17the Secretary of State on a 3-wheel motorcycle is also restricted to the operation of a 3-
18wheel motorcycle.  The bill requires motorcycle rider education schools to be licensed, 
19submit to inspections and establish a place of business.
20The bill also amends the driver education program laws to require that the 2 
21instructors who serve on the Secretary of State's Technical Review Panel be licensed in 
22the curriculum and training being reviewed.  The bill removes the authorization for the 
23State to bring an action in Superior Court to enjoin a person from violating the driver 
24education laws, as the penalties under those laws are administered by the District Courts.
