26General Fund appropriations and Other Special Revenue allocations from the Fund for a 
27Healthy Maine to the elderly low-cost drug program operated pursuant to section 254-D, 
28including rebates received in that program from pharmaceutical manufacturers, that are 
29no longer needed in that program as a result of the Medicaid waiver obtained pursuant to 
30subsection 1-C.
311-C.  Prescription drug waiver program.  Except as provided in paragraph G, the 
32department shall apply to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a 
33waiver or amend a pending or current waiver under the Medicaid program authorizing the 
34department to use federal matching dollars to enhance the prescription drug benefits 
35available to persons who qualify for the elderly low-cost drug program established under 
36section 254-D.  The program created pursuant to the waiver is the prescription drug 
37waiver program, referred to in this subsection as the "program."

39levels for the program up to and including 200% of the federal nonfarm income 
40official poverty level, except that for individuals in households that spend at least 
4140% of income on unreimbursed direct medical expenses for prescription 
42medications, the income eligibility level is increased by 25%.
Page 7 - 129LR0035(01)-11B.  To the extent reasonably achievable under the federal waiver process, the program 
2must include the full range of prescription drugs provided under the Medicaid 
3program on the effective date of this subsection and must limit copayments and cost 
4sharing for participants.  If cost sharing above the nominal cost sharing for the 
5Medicaid program is determined to be necessary, the department may use a sliding 
6scale to minimize the financial burden on lower-income participants.
7C.  Coverage under the program may not be less beneficial to persons who meet the 
8qualifications of former section 254 than the coverage available under that section on 
9September 30, 2001.

11department shall give equitable treatment to coverage of prescription medications for 
12cancer, Alzheimer's disease and behavioral health.
13E.  The department is authorized to provide funding for the program by using funds 
14appropriated or allocated to provide prescription drugs under sections 254-D and 258.
15F.  The department is authorized to amend the waiver or adjust program requirements 
16as necessary to take advantage of enhanced federal matching funds that may become 
17available.
18G.  If, upon thorough analysis, the department determines that a waiver under this 
19subsection is not feasible or would not significantly benefit participants in the elderly 
20low-cost drug program, the department may decide not to pursue the waiver.  Within 
2130 days of a decision not to proceed with a waiver and before taking action on that 
22decision, the department shall report to the joint standing committee of the 
23Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters and shall 
24provide a detailed analysis of the reasons for reaching that decision.
251-D.  Enrollment fee.  The department may assess an annual enrollment fee of $25 
26for participation in the MaineCare program for a family including a parent or caretaker 
27relative of a child described in subsection 1, paragraph B or D when the family's income 
28exceeds 150% of the nonfarm income official poverty line.
292.  Resource test.  The department may not apply a resource test to those children 
30and pregnant women who are made eligible under this section, unless these persons also 
31receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or United States Supplemental 
32Security Income benefits.
333.  Benefits authorized.  The scope of medical assistance to be provided within this 
34section shall must be that authorized by the Federal Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
35Act, Public Law 99-509.

37transitional Medicaid to families receiving benefits under Section 1931 of the federal 
38Social Security Act in accordance with 42 United States Code, Section 1396r-6 and this 
39subsection.  The amount, duration and scope of services provided under this subsection 
40must be the same as that provided to a parent or caretaker relative of a child described in 
41subsection 1, paragraph B or D.

2period in accordance with 42 United States Code, Section 1396r-6, Subsection (a), 
3Paragraph (5) to families whose eligibility for Medicaid assistance terminated due to 
4an increase in earned income, an increase in hours of employment or a loss of a time-
5limited earnings disregard.
6B.  The department shall provide transitional Medicaid for 4 months to families 
7whose eligibility for Medicaid assistance terminated due to an increase in the amount 
8of child support received by the family.

10Pt. NNNNNNN, ยง10; c. 290, ยง1; and c. 412, ยง2, is further amended to read:
11B.  The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in 
12accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for

15subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:

17support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass-through from the budget 
18tests and benefit calculations;

21Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of 
22noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 
23aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 
24noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 
25assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  
26July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household 
27remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 
28for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 
29receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 
30on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance

39(d)  Unemployed but has obtained proper work documentation, as defined by 
40the department by rule.  Rules adopted by the department under this division

3caretaker relative;
4(4)  To provide an assistance program for needy children, 19 to 21 years of age, 
5who are in full-time attendance in secondary school.  The program is operated for 
6those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United States Social Security 
7Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the 
8parent or caretaker relative of those individuals.  Except for the age requirement, 
9all provisions of TANF, including the standard of need and the amount of 
10assistance, apply to the program established pursuant to this subparagraph;
11(5)  To provide assistance for a pregnant woman who is otherwise eligible for 
12assistance under this chapter, except that she has no dependents under 19 years of

15than 90 days following the date the benefit is received;
16(6)  To provide a special housing allowance for TANF families whose shelter 
17expenses for rent, mortgage or similar payments, homeowners insurance and 
18property taxes equal or exceed 50% of their monthly income.  The special 
19housing allowance is limited to $300 per month for each family.  For purposes of 
20this subparagraph, "monthly income" means the total of the TANF monthly 
21benefit and all income countable under the TANF program, plus child support 
22received by the family, excluding the $50 pass-through payment;

26(a)  One hundred and eight dollars;
27(b)  Fifty percent of the remaining earnings that are less than the federal 
28poverty level; and
29(c)  All actual child care costs necessary for work, except that the department

17Medicaid for a 12-month extension period pursuant to the state option provided in 42 
18United States Code, Section 1396r-6, Subsection (a), Paragraph (5) when a person's 
19eligibility was terminated because of an increase in earned income or hours of 
20employment or a loss of a time-limited earnings disregard.
215.  It eliminates the TANF gross income test for applicants to conform the eligibility 
22methodology for both applicants and recipients.
236.  It establishes a procedure by which the Department of Health and Human Services 
24must consider referrals made in accordance with department rule from educational 
25institutions and similar programs as applications for the Parents as Scholars Program 
26under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 3790.
277.  It provides funds from the TANF block grant to provide personalized professional 
28guidance, support and navigation services for participants in the Parents as Scholars 
29Program in order to promote program completion and student success and requires the 
30Commissioner of Health and Human Services to convene a working group to make 
31recommendations related to the most effective way to achieve this goal, along with other 
32suggestions to improve the program.
338.  It requires the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to convene a working 
34group to review and make recommendations to improve the operations of systems and 
35programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services providing 
36services to people in need.
379.  It provides that additional costs to the State resulting from implementation of this 
38legislation must be paid from funds provided to the Department of Health and Human 
39Services under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant or from 
40resources representing the State's maintenance of effort to qualify for federal funds.
