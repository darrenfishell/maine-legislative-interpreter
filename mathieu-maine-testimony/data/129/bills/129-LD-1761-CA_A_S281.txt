1 3. Similar to the definition of "small beer manufacturer" in the bill, it defmes "small 
2 hard cider manufacturer" as a licensed Maine small winery or out-of-state winery that 
3 ferments, ages or bottles any amount of wine, as long as it ferments, ages or bottles no 
4 more than 3,000 barrels per year of wine that is hard cider; 
5 4. It applies the provisions of the bill that affect the relationship between a wholesale 
6 licensee and a small beer manufacturer to the relationship between a wholesale licensee 
7 and a small hard cider manufacturer, including by establishing the amount of reasonable 
8 compensation that a small hard cider manufacturer must pay to a wholesale licensee when 
9 it terminates the authority of the wholesale licensee to distribute its hard cider products 
10 and by authorizing the small hard cider manufacturer to continue selling its products 
11 during the arbitration of any dispute between the parties regarding the amount of 
12 reasonable compensation; 
13 5. Under current law, when any manufacturer and wholesale licensee disagree over 
14 the amount of reasonable compensation due after the manufacturer amends or terminates 
15 the contract between the parties in a way that removes the wholesaler's authority to 
16 distribute one or more of the manufacturer's brands of liquor, the parties must submit the 
17 reasonable compensation question to arbitration. Under the amendment, the arbitrator is 
18 directed to issue a written decision on the matter no later than 45 days after the date of the 
19 commencement of the arbitration proceeding; and 
20 6. The amendment also makes several technical changes and reorganizes the 
21 structure of the bill.
