Fiscal Note 
Future biem1ium cost increase -General Fund 
Increasing the major capital maximum debt service limit for school construction projects from $126 million to $150 
million beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 will not increase the total state and local cost ofK-12 public education, or the 
State's share of that cost, in the 2020-2021 biennium. Sufficient lead time is not available to bring new projects on line 
that would require funding for additional debt service payments in the 2020-2021 biennium. 
The increase in the debt service limit for school constrnction may increase the total cost of K-12 public education in 
future biennia as a result of higher debt service costs. The impact can not be estimated and will depend on the number 
of projects approved and the debt service required for those projects. Unless additional funds are appropriated to 
cover the increased costs, the distribution of state subsidy to local school administrative units may be impacted.
