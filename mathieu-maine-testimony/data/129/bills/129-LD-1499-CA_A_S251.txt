SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. 
The amendment, as in the bill, establishes the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability 
Board but removes the provisions that allow rate setting by the board and require the 
board to determine excess prescription drug costs based upon certain thresholds for 
prescription drug prices and price increases. 
The amendment instead provides that the board determines prescription drug 
spending targets for public entities, including for specific prescription drugs, based upon 
a 10-year rolling average of the medical care services component of the United States 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index medical care 
services index plus a reasonable percentage for inflation and minus a spending target
