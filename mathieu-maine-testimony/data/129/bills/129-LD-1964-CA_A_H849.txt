18intelligence and investigative record information to a governmental agency or subunit of

22person to whom the records relate to possess a firearm if the person is prohibited 
23from doing so as a result of the adjudication to which the sealed juvenile case records 
24relate; and
25D.  The amendment establishes that a person has a right to appeal a court's denial of 
26the person's petition to seal a juvenile case record.
27The amendment makes no change to current law regarding the process for sealing 
28juvenile court records regarding adjudications for murder or Class A, B or C crimes or 
29operating under the influence, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, 
30section 2411.
