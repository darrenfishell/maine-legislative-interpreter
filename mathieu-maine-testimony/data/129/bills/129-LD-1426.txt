Page 1 - 129LR1767(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §6203-F, as repealed and replaced by PL 1991, c. 707, §2, is 
3repealed and the following enacted in its place:
4§6203-F.  Foreclosure of residential land installment contracts
51.  Foreclosure procedure.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if 
6the purchaser of real estate under a residential land installment contract who is in 
7possession or intends to take possession of the real estate is in default of any of the terms 
8of that contract, the seller or the seller's heirs or assigns may foreclose the rights of the 
9purchaser in the contract. For purposes of this section, "land installment contract" has the 
10same meaning as in Title 33, section 481, subsection 2.
112.  Redemption period.  A judgment for foreclosure under this section must contain 
12a 90-day redemption period. Within the redemption period, the purchaser or a person 
13claiming under the purchaser may apply to any Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court or 
14Superior Court for an extension of time to redeem, and after such notice as the court may 
15order, for good cause shown, the court may extend the redemption period to a maximum 
16of one year. An extension order is not binding against any person without actual notice of 
17the order unless, within the 90-day period, a written notice describing the land, 
18identifying the instrument under which foreclosure proceedings have been brought and 
19setting forth the fact that application for extension of the redemption period has been 
20made is recorded in the registry of deeds in the county in which the land is located. This 
21section may not be construed to extend the life of options with an ascertainable time of 
22termination.
233.  Foreclosing party as mortgagee.  A seller or other foreclosing party under this 
24section is subject to the requirements imposed upon a mortgagee under sections 6101, 
256111, 6321, 6321-A, 6321-B, 6322 and 6322-A.
26Sec. 2.  33 MRSA §481, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1983, c. 368, is amended to 
27read:
282.  Land installment contract.  "Land installment contract" means an agreement 
29under which the vendor agrees to sell an interest in property to the purchaser and the 
30purchaser agrees to pay the purchase price in 5 or more subsequent payments exclusive of 
31the down payment, if any, and the vendor retains title to the property as security for the 
32purchaser's obligation under the agreement.  Land installment contracts include a bond 
33for deed, a contract for the sale of real estate, option contracts for the purchase of real 
34property, an agreement for the occupancy of residential real estate in which the occupant 
35is required to make an initial payment in excess of 4 times the periodic monthly payments 
36required to occupy the premises and an agreement in which a person is induced to occupy 
37a property as a primary residence by a promise or offer to grant ownership of the property 
38to the person at a future date.  Land installment contracts do not include option contracts 
39for the purchase of real property or purchase and sale agreements entered into with the 
40good faith expectation of a separate transaction in which a 3rd party or the seller agrees to 
41finance the purchase price in a single installment.

5Q.  A clear and conspicuous provision above the place for the signature of the 
6purchaser which that acknowledges receipt by the purchaser of a copy of the land 
7installment contract signed by the vendor.; and
8Sec. 4.  33 MRSA §482, sub-§1, ¶R is enacted to read:
9R.  A statement that the vendor has inspected the property to be conveyed and 
10certifies that the property is in compliance with Title 14, sections 6021 and 6021-A.
11Sec. 5.  33 MRSA §482, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1983, c. 368, is amended to 
12read:
132.  Recordation.  Within 20 days after the contract has been signed by both the 
14vendor and the purchaser, the vendor shall cause a copy of the contract or a memorandum 
15of the contract to be recorded at the purchaser's expense in the registry of deeds in the 
16county where the property sold under the contract is located.  If a memorandum of the 
17contract is recorded, it shall must be entitled "Memorandum of a Land Installment 
18Contract" and shall must contain, as at a minimum, the names of the parties, the 
19signatures of the parties, a description of the property and applicable time periods.  A 
20person other than a vendor and purchaser may rely on the recorded materials in 
21determining whether the requirements of this subsection have been met.  If a contract is 
22not recorded pursuant to this subsection, the vendor may not enforce the contract.
23Sec. 6.  33 MRSA §482, sub-§§4 and 5 are enacted to read:
244.  Vendor is creditor.  A vendor in a land installment contract is a creditor under 
25Title 9-A, section 1-301, subsection 17.

27Practices Act. In addition to any other rights and remedies a purchaser may have in the 
28law, upon a finding that a violation of this chapter by a vendor has occurred, a court shall 
29find one or both of the following:
30A.  The purchaser is entitled to recover all actual damages or $1,000, whichever is 
31greater; and
32B.  The purchaser is entitled to recover the aggregate amount of costs, expenses and 
33attorney's fees determined by the court to have reasonably been incurred on the 
34purchaser's behalf in connection with the prosecution or defense of the matter.
35Sec. 7.  33 MRSA §483 is enacted to read:
Page 3 - 129LR1767(01)-11§483.  Prohibited acts
21.  Bad faith avoidance.  A person may not in bad faith attempt to avoid the 
3application of this chapter including engaging in subterfuge or designing or structuring a 
4transaction with the purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter.
52.  Survival of foreclosure.  A land installment contract may not require a purchaser 
6to enter into a promissory note or any other financial instrument or obligation that 
7survives the foreclosure of the purchaser's interest in the real estate.
8SUMMARY
9This bill expands the definition of "land installment contracts," creates foreclosure 
10procedures for residential land installment contracts that include a 90-day redemption 
11period and removes the right to cure of the purchaser and imposes mortgagee 
12requirements on the foreclosing party.  This bill also requires the vendor of a land 
13installment contract to certify that the property meets the warranty of habitability under 
14state law, makes the vendor of a land installment contract a creditor under the Maine 
15Consumer Credit Code and, along with other remedies, makes a violation of the 
16provisions regarding land installment contracts a violation under the Maine Unfair Trade 
17Practices Act.
