28SUMMARY
29This bill amends the motor vehicle laws in the following ways.
301.  It amends the law governing motor vehicle frame end heights to increase 
31dimensions for current weight ranges of vehicles.  It also adds vehicles from 11,501 
32pounds to 13,000 pounds, which may have frame end heights of 32 inches in the front and 
3334 inches in the rear.
342.  It establishes that a vehicle owned by the Department of Public Safety may be 
35equipped with blue emergency lighting and a siren, but neither the lighting nor the siren 
36may be displayed or used except when the vehicle is being operated by a law enforcement 
37officer.
Page 3 - 129LR2346(01)-113.  It establishes that a person may not operate, or cause to have operated, a 
2diesel-powered motor vehicle with a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating under 
318,000 pounds that emits visible smoke on a public way or parking area because of a 
4permanent or temporary alteration to the air pollution control system of the motor vehicle.  
5Emitting visible smoke by using such an alteration is commonly referred to as "rolling 
6coal."
74.  It excludes the use of electronic logging devices from the definition of "text 
8messaging" in the law that governs text messaging while operating a motor vehicle.
95.  It establishes that the law governing motor vehicle heights and widths does not 
10apply to snowplows and equipment mounted on a vehicle traveling from one work 
11location to another work location during a snow event, or traveling from the point of 
12purchase to a storage location, as long as the vehicle does not exceed 108 inches in total 
13width.  The term "snow event" is defined as the period beginning 48 hours before a 
14predicted snowstorm and ending 48 hours after the snowstorm.
