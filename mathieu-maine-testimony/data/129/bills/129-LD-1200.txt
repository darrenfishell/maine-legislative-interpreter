Page 1 - 129LR1066(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit Program promotes the growth of new 
4and existing small businesses in the State, which results in increased job opportunities for 
5Maine residents, produces more spending in the State and increases municipal tax bases; 
6and
7Whereas, the total amount of tax credits available to investors is limited on a 
8calendar year basis; and
9Whereas, for calendar year 2019, the limit has already been reached; and
10Whereas, without an immediate increase in the limit on available tax credits, 
11investment in Maine businesses could suffer; and
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,
