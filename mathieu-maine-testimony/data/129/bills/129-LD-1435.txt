H.P. 1045 House of  Representatives, March 28, 2019
Resolve, Directing the Joint Standing  Committee on Transportation  
To Study Transportation Funding Reform
(EMERGENCY)
Reference to the Committee on Transportation  suggested and ordered  printed.
ROBERT  B. HUNT
Clerk
Presented by Representative McLEAN of Gorham.

Page 1 - 129LR1215(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, adequate, sustainable and predictable transportation funding is critical to 
4the safety and economic well-being of all Maine citizens; and
5Whereas, funding for transportation infrastructure in Maine and the nation is 
6seriously deficient; and
7Whereas, the shortfall of funding related to Maine's state highway and bridge 
8system is at least $168,000,000 per year, without consideration of general obligation 
9bonding; and
10Whereas, the shortfall of capital funding related to Maine's multimodal system of 
11ports, rail and other modes of transportation is substantial; and
12Whereas, general obligation bonding levels are unpredictable due to the current 
13short-term focus of the process that determines bonding levels and priorities, a process 
14that usually takes place late in a legislative session after finalization of the General Fund 
15budget, if at all; and
16Whereas, higher fuel efficiency of vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles continue to 
17erode the funding provided by per gallon fuel taxes and increase the inequity among 
18drivers in terms of the fee paid per mile for use of the highway and bridge system; and
19Whereas, fuel prices are relatively low but surely will rise in the years ahead; and
20Whereas, approximately 30,000,000 people visit Maine each year, a state with a 
21year-round population of about 1,300,000 people, and the capacity and a significant 
22portion of the cost of Maine's transportation system are driven by seasonal traffic 
23volumes; and
24Whereas, through years of capital planning, prioritization and efficiency initiatives, 
25the Department of Transportation has proven that it uses funding efficiently and 
26effectively; and
27Whereas, although federal transportation funding levels have been established for 
28the next 5 years, these funding levels will not solve Maine's transportation funding 
29problems and additional federal funding solutions are unlikely; and
30Whereas, other states are finding transportation funding solutions and the State has 
31an obligation to all its citizens to seek solutions now; and
32Whereas, the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation is charged with 
33analyzing options and recommending legislation and is best equipped to study these 
34issues and find ways to reform and supplement transportation funding in Maine; and
Page 2 - 129LR1215(01)-11Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that 
2the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
3legislative session; and
4Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
5the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
6immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
7therefore, be it
8Sec. 1.  Study.  Resolved:  That the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation, 
9referred to in this resolve as "the committee," shall study how to reform and adequately 
10supplement funding for the State's transportation infrastructure to promote equity, 
11sustainability and predictability in a manner that allows the State to responsibly provide a 
12safe and reliable state transportation system.
13Sec. 2.  Convening of committee.  Resolved:  That the chairs of the committee 
14shall call and convene the first meeting of the committee for the purposes of this resolve 
15no later than 30 days following the effective date of this resolve.
16Sec. 3.  Meetings.  Resolved:  That the committee may meet for the purposes of 
17this resolve only when the Legislature is not in regular or special session.  The committee 
18may meet up to 4 times to accomplish its duties under section 4.  At least 2 meetings must 
19allow public comment.
20Sec. 4.  Duties. Resolved:  That the committee shall focus on funding the state 
21highway and bridge system, but shall also consider capital funding through the issuance 
22of bonds for multimodal infrastructure.  The committee shall:
231. Identify mechanisms that will increase the predictability of general obligation 
24bonding levels for capital planning at the Department of Transportation for the state 
25highway and bridge system and multimodal infrastructure for the next 10 years;
262. Consult with the Secretary of State to identify mechanisms to address the erosion 
27of Highway Fund receipts and the rising inequity among drivers caused by higher 
28automobile fuel efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles, such as adding a registration fee 
29surcharge on hybrid, electric or other alternative fuel passenger automobiles or a 
30voluntary so-called vehicle miles traveled pilot program for passenger automobiles;
313. Consult with the Secretary of State to consider adjustments to motor vehicle fees 
32that will align these fees with regional averages;
334. Consider dedicating a portion of sales tax receipts from transportation-related sales 
34to transportation infrastructure;
355. Consider adding a wholesale fuel tax component, including options that would 
36reduce baseline per gallon fuel tax rates;
Page 3 - 129LR1215(01)-116. Consider adjusting fuel tax rates, including a pump-price surcharge that is 
2eliminated as fuel prices increase, or a reduction of the year-round baseline gasoline tax 
3rates and the addition of a seasonal gasoline tax surcharge; and
47. Invite knowledgeable stakeholders to provide written and oral comments on draft 
5recommendations of the committee.  Knowledgeable stakeholders must include 
6representatives from the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, the 
7Maine Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Associated General

14provide information and data to the committee as necessary for its work.
15Sec. 6.  Staff assistance.  Resolved:  That the Legislative Council shall provide 
16necessary staffing services to the committee.
17Sec. 7.  Report.  Resolved:  That, no later than December 4, 2019, the committee 
18shall submit a report that includes its findings and recommendations, including suggested 
19legislation, for presentation to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.  The 
20committee may submit legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature 
21related to the report.

23Highway Fund by appropriate appropriation or allocation.

25legislation takes effect when approved.
