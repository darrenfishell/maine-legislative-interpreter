Page 1 - 129LR1328(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §4301-A, sub-§§4-A and 4-B are enacted to read:
34-A.  Emergency medical condition.  "Emergency medical condition" means the 
4sudden and, at the time, unexpected onset of a physical or mental health condition 
5manifesting itself by symptoms of sufficient severity, regardless of the final diagnosis 
6that is given, that would lead a prudent layperson, possessing an average knowledge of 
7medicine and health, to believe:
8A.  That the absence of immediate medical attention for an individual could 
9reasonably be expected to result in:
10(1)  Placing the physical or mental health of the individual or, with respect to a 
11pregnant woman, the health of the pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious 
12jeopardy;
13(2)  Serious impairment of a bodily function;
14(3)  Serious dysfunction of any organ or body part; or
15(4)  Inadequately controlled pain; or
16B.  With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions, that there is:
17(1)  Inadequate time to effect a safe transfer of the woman to another hospital 
18before delivery; or
19(2)  A threat to the health or safety of the woman or unborn child if the woman 
20were to be transferred to another hospital.
214-B.  Emergency service.  "Emergency service" means a health care item or service 
22furnished or required to evaluate and treat an emergency medical condition that is 
23provided in an emergency facility or setting by a health care provider.
24Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §4304, sub-§5, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 742, §13, is 
25amended to read:
265.  Emergency services.  When conducting utilization review or making a benefit 
27determination for emergency services, a carrier shall provide benefits for emergency 
28services consistent with the requirements of this subsection and any applicable bureau 
29rule.
30A.  A carrier may not require prior authorization for emergency services.
31B.  Before a carrier denies benefits or reduces payment for an emergency service 
32based on a determination of the absence of an emergency medical condition or a 
33determination that a lower level of care was needed than is required for an emergency 
34medical condition, the carrier shall review the enrollee's medical record related to the 
35emergency medical condition subject to dispute.  If a carrier requests records related 
36to a potential denial of or payment reduction for an enrollee's benefits when 
37emergency services were furnished to an enrollee, a provider has an affirmative duty 
38to respond to the carrier in a timely manner.  A carrier's utilization review of 
Page 2 - 129LR1328(01)-11emergency services must be conducted by a clinical peer that is board certified in the 
2same specialty and licensed to practice in this State.
3Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4320-C, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 364, §34, is amended to 
4read:
5§4320-C.  Emergency services
6If a carrier offering a health plan subject to the requirements of the federal Affordable 
7Care Act provides or covers any benefits with respect to services in an emergency 
8department of a hospital, the plan must cover emergency services in accordance with the 
9requirements of the federal Affordable Care Act, including requirements that emergency 
10services be covered without prior authorization and that cost-sharing requirements, 
11expressed as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate, for out-of-network services are the 
12same as requirements that would apply if such services were provided in network.  A 
13carrier offering a health plan in this State shall also comply with the requirements of 
14section 4304, subsection 5.
15SUMMARY
16This bill establishes a definition of "emergency medical condition" in the law 
17governing utilization review in the Maine Insurance Code and makes clear that the 
18determination of an emergency medical condition relies on the prudent layperson 
19standard regardless of the final diagnosis that is given.  The bill also prohibits a carrier 
20from requiring prior authorization for emergency services and requires that utilization 
21review of benefit determinations for emergency services be conducted by a clinical peer, 
22who is a licensed provider in the same or similar specialty as typically manages the 
23medical condition, procedure or treatment under review.
