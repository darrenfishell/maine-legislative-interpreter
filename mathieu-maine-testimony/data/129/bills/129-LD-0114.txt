30SUMMARY
31This bill provides for open primary elections for the elections for United States 
32Senator, United States Representative to Congress, Governor, State Senator and State 
33Representative.  All of the candidates for those offices, including candidates enrolled in a 
34party and unenrolled candidates, must appear on the same open primary ballot.  All 
35qualified voters, regardless of enrollment status, are eligible to vote in open primary 
36elections.
Page 12 - 129LR0189(01)-11The votes in an open primary election must be tabulated using ranked-choice voting, 
2except that the 2 candidates who receive the most votes are declared the winners of the 
3open primary and their names must appear on the ballot for the general election.  If one of 
4the 2 candidates who received the most votes at the open primary withdraws from the 
5race at least 70 days before the general election, that candidate must be replaced with the 
6candidate who received the 3rd most votes in the open primary election, if any. Voters 
7may not vote for a write-in candidate in a general election that was preceded by an open 
8primary election.  As a result, ranked-choice voting will no longer be used in general 
9elections for United States Senator and United States Representative to Congress.  
10Instead, the candidate who receives a plurality of votes at the general election will be 
11elected to those offices.
