FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 94, L.D. 112, Bill, "An Act To 
Implement Changes to Maine's Solid Waste Laws Pursuant to a Review of the State 
Waste Management and Recycling Plan" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'PART A 
Sec. A-1. 38 MRSA §1303-C, sub-§1-C, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 338, §1 and 
affected by §5 and enacted by c. 414, §1, is amended to read: 
1-C. Bypass. "Bypass" means any solid waste that is destined for disposal, 
processing or beneficial use at a an operating solid waste facility but that cannot be 
disposed of, processed or beneficially used at that facility because of the facility's 
temporary malfunction, temporary insufficient capacity, temporary inability to process or 
burn, or temporary downtime or any other comparable reason. For the purposes of this 
subsection, "operating solid waste facility" means a licensed solid waste facility that is 
fully operational at the time that the malfunction, insufficient capacity, inability to 
process or bum or downtime begins and that intends to resume full operation at the time 
that the malfunction, insufficient capacity. inability to process or bum or downtime ends. 
Sec. A-2. 38 MRSA §2152-A is enacted to read: 
§2152-A. State-owned solid waste dis.posal facilities; purpose, management and 
operation; disposal of municipal solid waste 
1. Purpose of State-owned solid waste disposal facilities. The Legislature finds 
that the purpose of State-owned solid waste disposal facilities is to ensure that adequate 
disposal capacity is available for the disposal of solid waste generated within the State 
through the development of new disposal capacity for anticipated state disposal capacity 
needs and the operation of existing facilities to address current state disposal capacity 
needs.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A"to H.P. 94, L.D. 112 
2. Consistency with solid waste management hierarchy. The Legislature intends 
2 that all aspects of the management and operation of State-owned solid waste disposal 
3 facilities be conducted in a manner that maximizes alignment with the solid waste 
4 management hierarchy under section 2101. 
5 The bureau, the operators of State-owned solid waste disposal facilities and the 
6 department shall ensure that the acceptance of waste at State-owned solid waste disposal 
7 facilities is consistent with the hierarchy and that options for the management of such 
8 waste that represent a higher priority on the hierarchy are not otherwise reasonably 
9 available. 
10 3. Disposal of municipal solid waste at State-owned solid waste disposal 
11 facilities;' department authorization criteria; department limitation of disposal. The 
12 Legislature intends that the State prioritize the disposal at State-owned solid waste 
13 disposal facilities of special wastes for which there are limited disposal options in the 
14 State and minimize the disposal at State-owned solid waste disposal facilities of non-
15 bypass, unprocessed municipal solid waste. In accordance with this intent and with the 
16 provisions of this chapter and chapter 13, the department may: 
17 A. Authorize the land disposal of non-bypass. unprocessed municipal solid waste at a 
18 State-owned solid waste disposal facility only when: 
19 (1) A specific need for the disposal has been identified by the bureau and the 
20 operator of the facility: 
21 (2) The disposal is consistent with the solid waste management hierarchy under 
22 section 2101. as determined by the department: and 
23 (3) Options for the management of the waste that represent a higher priority on 
24 the hierarchy are not otherwise reasonably available, as determined by the 
25 department: and 
26 B. Limit the volume of municipal solid waste disposed of at a State-owned solid 
27 waste disposal facility and the duration of such disposal through the imposition of 
28 such limitations under the facility's license. 
29 Sec. A-3. 38 MRSA §2156-A, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 655, Pt. GG, 
30 §43 and affected by §70, is further amended to read: 
31 1. Planning for development. The bureau, in consultation with the department, 
32 shall plan for the development of facilities sufficient to meet anticipated unmet needs for 
33 municipal solid waste and special waste identified in the state plan and any revisions to 
34 the plan and to serve all geographic areas of the State. The bureau, in consultation ',vith 
35 the department, may plan for th@ development of facilities suffieioot to meet needs for 
36 special wast@ idootifi@d in the state plan and any rnvisions to the plan and to serve all
