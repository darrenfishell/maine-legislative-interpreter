2§3106.  Application
31.  Dealer acceptance.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a dealer 
4operating a retail space of 5,000 square feet or more may not refuse to accept from any 
5consumer or other person not a dealer any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean 
6beverage container of the kind, size and brand sold by the dealer, or refuse to pay in cash 
7the refund value of the returned beverage container as established by section 3103 unless 
8the dealer has a written agreement with a redemption center that is located within 10 
9miles from the dealer, as measured along public roadways, to provide redemption 
10services on behalf of the dealer. This section does not require an operator of a vending 
11machine to maintain a person to accept returned beverage containers on the premises 
12where the vending machine is located.
132.  Permissive refusal by dealer.  A dealer may refuse to accept from a consumer or 
14other person and to pay the refund value on any beverage container, if the place of 
15business of the dealer and the kind, size and brand of beverage container are included in 
16an order of the department approving a redemption center under section 3109.
173.  Limitation or number of returnables accepted.  A dealer may limit the total 
18number of beverage containers that the dealer will accept from any one consumer or other 
19person in any one business day to 240 containers, or any other number greater than 240.
204.  Limitation on hours for returning containers.  A dealer may refuse to accept 
21beverage containers during no more than 3 hours in any one business day. If a dealer 
22refuses to accept containers under this subsection, the hours during which the dealer will

245.  Distributor acceptance.  A distributor may not refuse to accept from any dealer 
25or local redemption center any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage container

28chapter of the kind, size and brand sold by the distributor or refuse to pay to the dealer or 
29local redemption center the refund value of a beverage container as established by section 
303103.

32distributor or its agent may refuse to accept, or pay the refund value and handling costs to 
33a dealer, redemption center or other person for, a beverage container that has been 
34processed by a reverse vending machine in a way that has reduced the recycling value of 
35the container below current market value.  This subsection may not be interpreted to 
36prohibit a written processing agreement between a distributor and a dealer or redemption 
37center and does not relieve a distributor of its obligation under subsection 8 to accept 
38empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers.  The department shall adopt 
39rules to establish the recycling value of beverage containers under this subsection and the 
40rules may authorize the use of a 3rd-party vendor to determine if a beverage container has 
41been processed by a reverse vending machine in a manner that has reduced the recycling 
42value below current market value.  The rules must outline the method of allocating 
Page 9 - 129LR2466(01)-11among the parties involved the payment for 3rd-party vendor costs.  Rules adopted under 
2this subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
32-A.
47.  Reimbursement of handling costs.  Reimbursement of handling costs is 
5governed by this subsection.
6A.  In addition to the payment of the refund value, the initiator of the deposit under

8center for the cost of handling beverage containers subject to section 3103, in an 
9amount that equals at least 3¢ per returned container for containers picked up by the 
10initiator before March 1, 2004, at least 3 1/2¢ for containers picked up on or after 
11March 1, 2004 and before March 1, 2010 and at least 4¢ for containers picked up on 
12or after March 1, 2010.  The initiator of the deposit may reimburse the dealer or local 
13redemption center directly or indirectly through a party with which it has entered into 
14a commingling agreement.
15B.  In addition to the payment of the refund value, the initiator of the deposit under 
16section 3103, subsection 3 shall reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for

202004 and before March 1, 2010 and at least 4¢ for containers picked up on or after 
21March 1, 2010.  The initiator of the deposit may reimburse the dealer or local 
22redemption center directly or indirectly through a contracted agent or through a party 
23with which it has entered into a commingling agreement.
24C.  The reimbursement that the initiator of the deposit is obligated to pay the dealer or 
25redemption center pursuant to paragraph A or B must be reduced by 1/2¢ for any 
26returned container that is subject to managed in a commingling program in 
27accordance with a qualified commingling agreement that allows the dealer or 
28redemption center to commingle beverage containers of like product group, material 
29and size.  A commingling agreement is qualified for purposes of this paragraph if the 
30department determines that 50% or more of the beverage containers of like product 
31group, material and size for which the deposits are being initiated in the State are 
32covered by the commingling agreement or that the initiators of deposit covered by the 
33commingling agreement are initiators of deposit for wine containers who each sell no 
34more than 100,000 gallons of wine or 500,000 beverage containers that contain wine 
35in a calendar year.  Once the initiator of deposit has established a qualified 
36commingling agreement for containers of a like product group, material and size, the 
37department shall allow additional brands to be included from a different product 
38group if they are of like material.  The State, through the Department of 
39Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
40Operations, shall make every reasonable effort to enter into a qualified commingling 
41agreement under this paragraph with every other initiator of deposit for beverage 
42containers that are of like product group, size and material as the beverage containers 
43for which the State is the initiator of deposit.
44D.  Paragraphs A, B and C do not apply to a brewer who annually produces no more 
45than 50,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more 
Page 10 - 129LR2466(01)-11than 250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product.  In 
2addition to the payment of the refund value, an initiator of deposit under section 
33103, subsections 1 to 4 who is also a brewer who annually produces no more than 
450,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more than 
5250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product shall 
6reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for the cost of handling beverage 
7containers subject to section 3103 in an amount that equals at least 3¢ per returned 
8container.
98.  Obligation to pick up and recycle containers.  The obligation to pick up and 
10recycle beverage containers subject to this chapter is determined as follows.
11A.  A distributor that initiates the deposit under section 3103, subsection 2 or 4 has 
12the obligation to pick up and recycle any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean 
13beverage containers of the particular kind, size and brand sold by the distributor from 
14dealers to whom that distributor has sold those beverages and from licensed 
15redemption centers designated to serve those dealers pursuant to an order entered 
16under section 3109.  A distributor that, within this State, sells beverages under a 
17particular label exclusively to one dealer, which dealer offers those labeled beverages 
18for sale at retail exclusively at the dealer's establishment, shall pick up any empty, 
19unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers of the kind, size and brand sold 
20by the distributor to the dealer only from those licensed redemption centers that serve 
21the various establishments of the dealer, under an order entered under section 3109 
22are located within 25 miles from the dealer, as measured along public roadways.  A 
23dealer that manufactures its own beverages for exclusive sale by that dealer at retail 
24has the obligation of a distributor under this section.  The commissioner may 
25establish by rule, in accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, 
26criteria prescribing the manner in which distributors shall fulfill the obligations 
27imposed by this paragraph.  The rules may establish a minimum number or value of 
28containers below which a distributor is not required to respond to a request to pick up 
29empty containers.  Any rules adopted under this paragraph must allocate the burdens
