The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $3,018,013 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $2,810,620 in fiscal year 2020-21 to provide grants to behavioral health providers to fund the 
costs of attracting, retaining and training new professional employees to deliver evidence-based outpatient 
psychosocial treatment services for children and families involved in the child protective services known as 
"functional family therapy -child welfare" and "multisysternic therapy for child abuse and neglect." 
This resolve also requires the DHHS to consult with behavioral health providers to develop a rate of reimbursement 
for these services under MaineCare and amend its rules under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Sections 
28 and 65 accordingly. However, since this consultation has not occured, it is not known what, if any, changes wiII be 
made to these rates in Mainecare. Thus, no estimate of these additional costs are made at this time.
