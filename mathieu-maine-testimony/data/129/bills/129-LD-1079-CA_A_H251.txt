129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 802, L.D. 1079, Bill, "An Act To 
Require Public Schools To Periodically Test for Radon" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Authorize Public Schools To Periodically Test for Radon' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §4013 is enacted to read: 
§4013. Radon 
1. Testing. A school administrative unit may hire a person registered with the 
division of environmental health within the Department of Health and Human Services 
under the Radon Registration Act to test an occupied elementary school, secondary 
school or other building of the school administrative unit every 5 years for radon. The 
method of testing must be consistent with testing standards established in rules adopted 
by the Department of Health and Human Services. The school administrative unit shall 
maintain, make available for review and notify parents, faculty and staff of test results 
under this subsection. The school administrative unit shall report radon test results to the 
Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. No later 
than October 1, 2025, and every 5 years thereafter, the Department of Health and Human 
Services shall submit a report of the test results from all school administrative units to the 
Legislature and the Governor. 
2. Funding. When funds are available, the department shall disburse money to 
school administrative units to use for radon testing. The department shall adopt rules to 
implement this subsection. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine 
technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
3. New schools. A school administrative unit, when building a new elementary 
school, secondary school or other building, shall use radon-resistant new construction

techniques consistent with rules adopted by the Department of Health and Human 
2 Services.' 
3 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
4 section number to read consecutively. 
5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, removes the 
7 requirement in the bill that school administrative units test for radon, but allows school 
8 administrative units to test for radon. It provides that any testing and new school 
9 construction must comply with rules adopted by the Department of Health and Human 
10 Services instead of recommendations of the United States Environmental Protection 
11 Agency as in the bill.

An Act To Require Public Schools To Periodically Test for Radon 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment•(+( JI· )S~ 
Committee: Health and Human Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to adopt rules to disburse funding for radon testing to local school 
administrative units (SAU's) when funding becomes available can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
The requirement that SAU's use radon-resistant new construction techniques when building a new elementary or 
secondary school will not have a fiscal impact on school construction costs as radon resistant techniques are already 
being used in new school contruction projects. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the provisions of this bill are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
