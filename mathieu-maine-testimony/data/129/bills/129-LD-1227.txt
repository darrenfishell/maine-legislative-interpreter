8unit willing to enroll the student in one of its schools, upon a written request from the 
9superintendent of the school administrative unit where the student resides setting forth the 
10student's circumstances giving rise to the request.  Upon written request by the student's 
11parent or guardian for a change of enrollment for any reason to any other school 
12administrative unit submitted to the superintendent of the school administrative unit 
13where the student resides, the superintendent shall submit a written request to the

16administrative unit where the student resides shall pay tuition for that student to the 
17receiving school administrative unit as calculated in accordance with this subsection 
18and chapter 219.
19B.  If a student subject to a designation under this subsection is receiving special 
20education services, the receiving school administrative unit designated by the 
21commissioner under this subsection is responsible for providing a free, appropriate 
22public education to the student, subject to the provisions of this subsection.  The 
23receiving school administrative unit shall invite the school administrative unit where 
24the student resides to participate in individualized education program team meetings 
25for the student, but the authorized representative of the receiving school 
26administrative unit shall make the decision on any issue on which consensus is not

28tuition payable pursuant to chapter 219, pay to the receiving school administrative 
29unit:

38the student resides or the superintendent of the receiving school administrative unit 
39may, within 10 calendar days of the commissioner's decision, request that the state

11programs or provide for students to participate in such programs in accordance with the 
12requirements of this Title.  They shall determine which students attend each school, 
13classify them and transfer them from school to school where more than one school is 
14maintained at the same time.  If a school administrative unit neither maintains a school 
15nor contracts for school privileges pursuant to chapter 115 and a student who resides in 
16the school administrative unit is unable to enroll in another school administrative unit, the 
17school board shall direct the superintendent of the school administrative unit where the 
18student resides to make a written request to the commissioner to designate a place of 
19enrollment for the student, pursuant to section 254, subsection 19.
20SUMMARY
21Current law allows the superintendent of a school administrative unit that neither 
22maintains a school nor contracts for school privileges to request the Commissioner of 
23Education to designate a school administrative unit as the receiving school administrative 
24unit for a student who is unable to find a school administrative unit willing to enroll the 
25student in one of its schools.
26This bill allows any student's parent or guardian to make a request for any reason to 
27the Commissioner of Education for the student to be transferred.  Upon the 
28commissioner's approval, the student must be enrolled in the receiving school 
29administrative unit.
