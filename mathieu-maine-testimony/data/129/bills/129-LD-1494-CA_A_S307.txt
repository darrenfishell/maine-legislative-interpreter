requirements. By March 31, 2024 and every 5 years thereafter. the commission shall 
submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
energy matters based on a review, conducted in consultation with the Governor's Energy 
Office, of the status and impacts of the implementation of the portfolio requirements for 
Class IA resources under subsection 3-B and thermal renewable energy credits under 
subsection 3-C. The review must be completed through a public process and must include 
consideration of impacts of these renewable portfolio requirements on energy prices and 
assessment of benefits on greenhouse gas emissions and the economy of the State. The 
report required under this subsection may be submitted in conjunction with the report 
required under subsection 3-A. paragraph C. After reviewing the report required under 
this subsection, the committee may report out legislation regarding renewable portfolio 
requirements.' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3210-G is enacted to read: 
§3210-G. Renewable portfolio standard procurement

commission. If the commission determines that contracts for an amount greater 
than 7% of retail electricity sales will provide financial benefits to ratepayers, it 
may approve contracts by December 31, 2020 for up to 10% of retail electricity 
sales. 
(2) No later than January 15, 2021, the commission shall initiate a 2nd

separately from the Class IA resource; or 
{b) Located at a different location from the Class IA resource and the 
commission finds that inclusion of the energy storage system would result in

remain stationary and under the same ownership throughout the contract term. 
(5) The commission may permit an energy storage system to be paired with and

absorbing energy and storing it for a period of time for use at a later time. 
2. Contract terms. A contract entered into pursuant to this section must be for a 
term of 20 years, unless the commission finds a contract for a longer term to be prudent. 
If a Class IA resource offers to sell capacity. the commission may allow a contract with

require any Class IA resource to offer or sell capacity in order to participate in any 
solicitation or contract under this section. 
3. Report. No later than March 31, 2023 and biennially thereafter. the commission 
shall submit a report regarding the status of contracts for Class IA resources under this 
section to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities 
and energy matters. The report must include, but is not limited to, a description of Class 
IA resources participating in competitive solicitations. information about the resources 
selected for contracts and the selection process, the benefits and costs of the contracts and 
recommendations about how to further stimulate investment in Class IA resources or 
achieve ratepayer benefits from Class IA resources. The report may include information 
about benefits and costs of the contracts to the State's economy, environmental quality or 
electricity consumers over both the short and long terms. Any analysis of the benefits or 
costs of the contracts must be based on a forecast of all avoided costs resulting from the 
contracts that is transparent and balanced over the long term. 
Sec. 3. Study; report; renewable energy goals market assessment. The 
Governor's Office of Policy and Management and the Governor's Energy Office shall 
jointly conduct a market assessment study, including an in-depth analysis and review of

SUMMARY 
This amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
1. It adds state goals for consumption of electricity from renewable resources. 
2. It updates renewable portfolio requirement terminology to use the terms "Class I" 
and "Class II," which are the terms used in practice and in agency rules. 
3. It clarifies certain definitions in the bill. 
4. It creates a Class IA renewable resource portfolio requirement and removes the 
increased requirements for Class I resources that are in the bill; the new Class IA 
requirement combined with the existing Class I requirement preserves the overall 
increase in requirements to 50% by 2030 that is in the bill. 
5. It applies a 300% multiplier for the output of a generator fueled by municipal solid 
waste in conjunction with recycling in Class II. 
6. It delays by one year the portfolio requirements for thermal renewable energy 
credits in the bill. 
7. It extends the alternative compliance payment policy to Class IA resources and 
thermal renewable energy credit requirements, and establishes a maximum alternative 
compliance payment rate of $50 for Class I, Class IA and thermal renewable energy 
credits. 
8. It creates options for electricity customers that receive service at the transmission 
or subtransmission voltage level to elect to opt out of Class IA resource portfolio 
requirements and thermal renewable energy credit requirements and the costs and 
benefits resulting from long-term contracts for Class IA resources. 
9. It requires the Public Utilities Commission to submit a report by March 31, 2024 
and every 5 years thereafter regarding the status and impacts of implementing the 
portfolio requirements for Class IA resources and thermal renewable energy credits. 
10. It amends the long-term contracting provisions in the bill to require 2 competitive 
solicitations for contracts with Class IA resources to procure, in total, an amount of 
energy or renewable energy credits equal to 14% of retail electricity sales in the State 
during calendar year 2018. It also adds language to allow energy storage systems to be 
awarded long-term contracts when paired as a complementary resource with a Class IA 
resource.

The bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to enter into long term contracts for the procurement of renewable 
capacity resources and establishes the evaluative criteria the PUC must use when awarding the contracts. The PUC 
has indicated that certain assessments related to the economic benefits of the contracts will require the use of an 
outside consultant. Based on the cost of previous consulting agreements, the PUC estimates these contracted services 
would cost $300,000 a year beginning in fiscal year 2019-20. The PUC is funded by an assessment set to produce 
sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the Legislature for operating the PUC. The increased allocations 
in this bill require a corresponding increase in revenue from the assessment on transmission and distribution utilities. 
These costs may eventually be passed on to customers through scheduled rate cases. 
The bill also directs the Governor's Office of Policy and Management and the Future (OPMF) and the Governor's 
Energy Office (GEO) to conduct a market assessment study and an analysis of the opportunities, potential and 
challenges of meeting the State's renewable energy goals. Upon request, the PUC may provide technical, legal and 
other assistance to the OPMF and GEO as part of the study and may recover up to $150,000 of the cost of doing so 
from an additional assessment on transmission and distribution utilities. If the PUC's assistance is requested, a 
financial order for an additional allocation would be required to allow for the expenditure of the funds.
