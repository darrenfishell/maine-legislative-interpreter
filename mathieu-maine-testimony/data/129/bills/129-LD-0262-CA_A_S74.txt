COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 74, LD. 262 ( ~_;1 lf) 
C. The court may impose a sentence other than a minimum unsuspended term of 
2 imprisonment set forth in paragraph B, if: 
3 (1) The court finds by substantial evidence that: 
4 (a) Imposition of a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under

7 paragraph B will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and
