20SUMMARY
21Current law requires that, when a person files with the Public Utilities Commission a 
22petition of approval for the construction, rebuilding or relocation of a transmission line, 
23that person must pay, in addition to the filing fee paid to the commission, an additional 
24filing fee to the Office of the Public Advocate equal to 1/100 of 1% of the estimated cost 
25to erect, rebuild or relocate the transmission line.  This bill increases the amount of the 
26additional filing fee to 2/100 of 1% of the estimated cost to erect, rebuild or relocate the 
27transmission line.  It also allows the Office of the Public Advocate to recover expenses in 
28the transmission line proceeding that exceed the amount of the original filing fee from the 
29person.
