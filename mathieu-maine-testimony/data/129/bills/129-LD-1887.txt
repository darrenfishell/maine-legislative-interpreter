Page 1 - 129LR2950(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, this legislation requires the Department of Transportation, Maine State 
4Ferry Service to develop an evaluation process to compare the cost of fuel over the 
5anticipated service life of a vessel as part of the new ferry vessel procurement process; 
6and
7Whereas, this legislation also requires the Department of Transportation to perform 
8a feasibility assessment to determine the costs and barriers associated with the use of 
9ferry vessels powered by electricity instead of fossil fuel; and
10Whereas, it is imperative that the evaluation process be developed and the 
11feasibility assessment be performed as soon as possible in order to be available for new 
12ferry vessel procurements using existing funds; and
13Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
15immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
16therefore, be it
17Sec. 1.  Ferry vessels powered by alternative fuel sources.  Resolved:  That 
18the Department of Transportation, Maine State Ferry Service shall seek alternative fuel 
19sources for its ferry vessels, including electricity from renewable sources, in order to help 
20reduce or control ongoing operational costs as well as to help the State meet its climate 
21goals established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 576-A.
22Sec. 2.  Feasibility assessment.  Resolved:  That the Department of 
23Transportation shall perform a feasibility assessment to determine the costs and barriers 
24associated with the use by the Maine State Ferry Service of ferry vessels powered by 
25electricity instead of fossil fuel.  The feasibility assessment must examine, at a minimum, 
26the following issues:
271.  The age of the current Maine State Ferry Service fleet and the expected service 
28life of each vessel;
292.  The anticipated timing of any repowering or significant overhauls of existing 
30vessels;
313.  The anticipated timing of the planning and construction of new vessels and the 
32expected or planned service life of the new vessels;
334.  For each vessel, the current annual fuel usage, the current annual cost of fuel, the 
34number of hours operated each year, the average gallons per hour, the size of the fuel 
35tanks and the refueling frequency;
365.  Any foreseeable operational changes that may have a bearing on the amount of 
37fuel used by each vessel;
Page 2 - 129LR2950(01)-116.  The difficulty of switching fuel sources when repowering existing vessels;
27.  The availability of naval architects, engineers and boatyards to design and build 
3vessels powered by electricity;
48.  Operational, staffing, safety and reliability concerns associated with including at 
5least one vessel powered by electricity in the Maine State Ferry Service fleet and whether 
6the use of diesel or electric hybrid technology would reduce those concerns; and
79.  Regulatory constraints from the United States Coast Guard and specific 
8identification of the applicable statutes, rules and guidance documents that bear on those 
9constraints.
10Sec. 3.  Evaluation of alternatives.  Resolved:  That, in any procurement 
11process for a new ferry vessel, the Department of Transportation, Maine State Ferry 
12Service shall develop an evaluation process to compare the cost of fuel over the 
13anticipated service life of a vessel powered by electricity and a vessel powered by fossil 
14fuel.  This evaluation should focus solely on operational costs and be based on reasonable 
15assumptions about the cost of fuel over the anticipated service life of the vessel.
16Sec. 4.  Report.  Resolved:  That, no later than July 31, 2020, the Department of 
17Transportation shall submit a report detailing the results of the feasibility assessment 
18under section 2 and the process to evaluate alternatives under section 3 to the Joint 
19Standing Committee on Transportation.
20Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
21legislation takes effect when approved.
22SUMMARY
23This resolve directs the Department of Transportation, Maine State Ferry Service to 
24seek alternative fuel sources for its ferry vessels, including electricity from renewable 
25sources, in order to help reduce or control ongoing operational costs as well as to help the 
26State meet its climate goals.  It directs the Maine State Ferry Service to develop an 
27evaluation process to compare the cost of fuel over the anticipated service life of a vessel 
28powered by electricity and a vessel powered by fossil fuel to use as part of the new vessel 
29procurement process.
30The department is directed to perform a feasibility assessment to determine the costs 
31and barriers associated with the use by the Maine State Ferry Service of ferry vessels 
32powered by electricity instead of fossil fuel and to submit a report on its findings and the 
33vessel evaluation process developed by the Maine State Ferry Service to the Joint 
34Standing Committee on Transportation by July 31, 2020.
