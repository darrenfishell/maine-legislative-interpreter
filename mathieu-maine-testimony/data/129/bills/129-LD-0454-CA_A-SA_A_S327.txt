9 L.D. 454, Bill, "An Act To Encourage the Purchase of Local Produce for Public Schools" 
10 Amend the amendment by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
11 'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §6602, sub-§12, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. 000, 
12 §1, is further amended to read: 
13 12. Local Produce Fund. The Local Produce Fund is established within the 
14 department. The fund is authorized to receive revenue from public and private sources. 
15 The fund must be held separate and apart from all other money, funds and accounts. Any 
16 balance remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year must be carried forward to the 
17 next fiscal year. The fund must be used to match $1 for every $3 a school administrative 
18 unit pays for produce or minimally processed foods purchased directly from a farmer, 
19 farmers' cooperative or local food hub in the State, to a maximum state contribution of 
20 $1,000 per school administrative unit in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,500 per school 
21 administrative unit in fiscal year 2020-21 and subsequent years or $2,000 per school 
22 administrative unit if funding is received and the school administrative unit sends a food 
23 service employee to local foods training administered by the department under subsection 
24 13. At the end of the fiscal year, the school administrative unit may provide the 
25 department with receipts documenting purchases pursuant to this subsection during that 
26 year. For purposes of this subsection, "minimally processed" means only the washing, 
27 cleaning, trimming, drying, sorting and packaging of food items or a combination of 
28 those activities. Reimbursement or partial reimbursement to school administrative units 
29 may only be made up to the amount available in the fund. Failure to reimburse does not 
30 constitute an obligation on behalf of the State to a school administrative unit. The 
31 department shall apply for federal grant funding to provide state contributions in excess 
32 of $1,000 per school administrative unit in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,500 per school 
33 administrative unit in fiscal year 2020-21 and subsequent years pursuant to this 
34 subsection if applicable grant funding is available. The department may accept grant 
35 funding from hospitals and other sources to provide state contributions in excess of 
36 $1,000 per school administrative unit in fiscal year 2019-20 and $1,500 per school 
37 administrative unit in fiscal year 2020-21 and subsequent years pursuant to this 
38 subsection.'
