10SUMMARY
11This bill establishes a procedure for the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and 
12Wildlife to take administrative action regarding alleged property violations without first 
13requiring criminal conviction or civil adjudication of the allegation.  Under this bill, if the 
14director of the Bureau of Warden Service has probable cause to suspect that civil trespass 
15or abuse of another person's property while fishing, hunting or trapping has been 
16committed by a person holding a fishing, hunting or trapping license or permit, the 
17commissioner may:
181.  For a first violation, order that the person complete a hunter safety course or other 
19safety course designated by the commissioner, regardless of whether the person is exempt 
20from hunter safety course requirements;
212.  For a 2nd violation, order that all licenses and permits issued to the person by the 
22Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife be suspended for a period of 2 years; and
233.  For a 3rd or subsequent violation, order that all licenses and permits issued to the 
24person by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife be permanently suspended.
25The bill provides a mechanism for notice and opportunities for hearing and appeal of  
26administrative action taken by the commissioner.
