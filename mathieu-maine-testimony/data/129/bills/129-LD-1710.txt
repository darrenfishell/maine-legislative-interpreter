3CHAPTER 25
4AUTOMATED DRIVING SAFETY ACT
5§2701.  Short title
6This chapter may be known and cited as "the Automated Driving Safety Act."
7§2702.  Definitions
8As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
9have the following meanings.
101.  Automated driving system.  "Automated driving system" means the hardware 
11and software that provide the capability of an automated vehicle to perform the complete 
12dynamic driving task on a sustained basis while engaged, regardless of whether the 
13system is limited to a specific operational design domain.
142.  Automated vehicle.  "Automated vehicle" means a vehicle equipped with an 
15automated driving system.
163.  Dynamic driving task.  "Dynamic driving task" means the real-time operational 
17and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, including:
18A.  Lateral vehicle motion control by way of steering;
19B.  Longitudinal vehicle motion control by way of acceleration and deceleration;
20C.  Monitoring the driving environment by way of object and event detection, 
21recognition, classification and response preparation;
22D.  Object and event response execution;
23E.  Maneuver planning; and
24F.  Enhancing conspicuity by way of lighting, signaling and gesturing.
25"Dynamic driving task" does not include functions such as trip scheduling and selection 
26of a destination or a waypoint.
274.  Operational design domain.  "Operational design domain" means the specific 
28conditions under which a particular automated driving system is designed to function.
295.  Operator.  "Operator" means the person with active control over an automated 
30vehicle.  If the automated driving system is not engaged, the operator is the individual 
31who is in control of the automated vehicle. If the automated driving system is engaged, 
32the operator is the provider.
Page 2 - 129LR1957(01)-116.  Provider.  "Provider" means an individual, organization or joint enterprise that 
2controls an automated driving system for testing or deployment of an automated vehicle 
3on a public way.  "Provider" includes an original equipment manufacturer, a multiple or 
4final stage manufacturer, an individual, organization or joint enterprise that alters an 
5automated vehicle prior to first retail sale or deployment of the vehicle or an individual, 
6organization or joint enterprise that modifies an automated vehicle after first retail sale or 
7deployment of the vehicle.
8§2703.  Registration of automated vehicles
91.  Registration.  An automated vehicle must be registered pursuant to chapter 5.  
10When the owner of a motor vehicle applies for registration under section 401, subsection 
112, or upon renewal of a registration of a motor vehicle, the Secretary of State shall 
12determine and record whether the motor vehicle is an automated vehicle.  If the Secretary 
13of State determines that the motor vehicle is an automated vehicle, the Secretary of State 
14shall record on the registration the name of the provider as the operator of the automated 
15vehicle while the automated driving system of the automated vehicle is engaged.
162.  Criteria for registration.  In addition to any other applicable requirements under 
17chapter 5, the Secretary of State may not register an automated vehicle unless:
18A.  The automated vehicle meets the federal motor vehicle safety standards for the 
19automated vehicle's model and year and all other applicable safety standards and 
20performance requirements established by federal and state statutory and regulatory 
21provisions.  A certification by a provider licensed under section 2704 that an 
22automated vehicle meets the requirements of this paragraph is prima facie evidence 
23that the requirements are met; and
24B.  The provider named as the operator of the automated vehicle while the automated 
25driving system is engaged under subsection 1 is licensed under section 2704.
263.  Modification of automated vehicle.  Any modification to an automated vehicle 
27or an automated vehicle's automated driving system invalidates a registration issued by 
28the Secretary of State for that vehicle and prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing a 
29registration for the automated vehicle unless the modification is:
30A.  Required by law;
31B.  Made on behalf of the automated vehicle's provider; or
32C.  Permitted by rule of the Secretary of State.
334.  Determination of unsafe or unfit automated vehicle.  The Secretary of State by 
34rule or by practice may decline to register or, with reasonable notice to the registrant, 
35suspend, revoke or decline to renew a registration of an automated vehicle that the 
36Secretary of State determines is unsafe, improperly equipped or otherwise unfit to be 
37operated on a public way.  In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary 
38of State may consider or treat as conclusive a decision of the federal Department of 
39Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the responsible 
40agency in another jurisdiction to decline to register or restrict a registration of a make, 
41model, kind or category of automated vehicle.
Page 3 - 129LR1957(01)-115.  No presumption of safety.  The issuance of a registration for an automated 
2vehicle under this section does not create a presumption as to the safety of an automated 
3vehicle or automated driving system and may not be interpreted to abrogate or amend any 
4statutory or regulatory provisions or any aspects of the common law pertaining to liability 
5for any damages or harm caused by an automated vehicle.
6§2704.  Licensure of operators of automated vehicles
71.  License required.  An individual or provider may not operate on a public way an 
8automated vehicle without a license issued by the Secretary of State under this 
9subsection.
102.  License requirements.  The Secretary of State may not issue a license to operate 
11an automated vehicle to an individual or provider unless:
12A.  The provider certifies that the provider has not and will not offer, enter into or 
13enforce a predispute arbitration agreement with a passenger, individual operator or 
14other individual riding in, hailing or involved in a collision with an automated 
15vehicle;
16B.  The provider maintains and provides evidence of insurance covering damages for 
17personal injury, death or property damage arising from the operation of the automated 
18vehicle in the amount of at least $25,000,000 in the form of:
19(1)  An instrument of insurance issued by an insurer with a valid certificate of 
20authority issued by the Superintendent of Insurance under Title 24-A, section 
21404;
22(2)  A surety bond issued by an authorized surety insurer or an eligible surplus 
23lines insurer; or
24(3)  Proof of self-insurance in a form and manner determined by the Secretary of 
25State; and
26C.  The provider:
27(1)  Consents that all matters arising from the operation of the automated vehicle 
28be subject to the jurisdiction of the State;
29(2)  Maintains a registered office and a registered agent in the State to accept 
30service of process; and
31(3)  Provides to the Secretary of State the name of the registered agent and 
32address of the registered office.
333.  Determination of unsafe or unfit operator.  The Secretary of State by rule or by 
34practice may decline to license or, with reasonable notice to the operator, suspend, revoke 
35or decline to renew a license of an operator that the Secretary of State determines is 
36unsafe or otherwise unfit to operate an automated vehicle on a public way.  In making a 
37determination under this subsection, the Secretary of State may consider or treat as 
38conclusive a decision of the federal Department of Transportation, National Highway 
39Traffic Safety Administration or the responsible agency in another jurisdiction to decline 
40to license or restrict a license of an operator.
Page 4 - 129LR1957(01)-114.  No presumption of safety.  The issuance of a license to a provider under this 
2section does not create a presumption as to the safety of an automated vehicle or 
3automated driving system and may not be interpreted to abrogate or amend any statutory 
4or regulatory provisions or any aspects of the common law pertaining to liability for any 
5damages or harm caused by an automated vehicle.
6§2705.  Liability
71.  Individual as operator.  If an individual is operating an automated vehicle when 
8the automated driving system is disengaged, that individual is the operator and is 
9responsible for the operation of the automated vehicle and is liable for any infraction, 
10offense or negligence resulting in personal injury, death or property damage that occurs 
11during the operation.  If while operating an automated vehicle an individual operator 
12engages the automated driving system or a safety system automatically engages without 
13the input of the individual, the question of responsibility for the operation of the 
14automated vehicle or liability for any subsequent infraction, offense or negligence 
15resulting in personal injury, death or property damage caused by the engagement of the 
16automated driving system or safety system is governed by applicable common or 
17statutory law and determined by the totality of the evidence and circumstances regarding 
18the infraction, offense or negligence.
192.  Provider as operator.  Except for the provisions of subsection 1, if the automated 
20driving system is engaged while an automated vehicle is being operated, the provider is 
21the operator and is responsible for the operation of the automated vehicle and is liable for 
22any infraction, offense or negligence resulting in personal injury, death or property 
23damage that occurs during the operation. A provider who is an operator has a duty to 
24exercise due care and reasonable diligence in the proper operation of the automated 
25vehicle.  A violation of a motor vehicle law or rule while a provider is the operator that 
26results in personal injury, death or property damage is negligence per se by the provider.
273.  Accidents.  If an automated vehicle is involved in an accident while a provider is 
28the operator, the provisions of section 2251 apply and the provider shall:
29A.  Ensure that the automated vehicle remains at the scene of the accident;
30B.  Pursuant to section 2251, subsection 2, immediately contact the appropriate law 
31enforcement agency;
32C.  Inform the law enforcement agency under paragraph B that the automated driving 
33system was engaged at the time of the accident; and
34D.  Transmit electronically or by the fastest means available the provider's financial 
35responsibility information under section 2251, subsection 6.
364.  Supplemental to other laws.  This section is supplemental to and does not repeal, 
37modify or preempt any liability that may arise under common or statutory law applicable 
38to a vehicle manufacturer.
Page 5 - 129LR1957(01)-11§2706.  Rules
2The Secretary of State shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this chapter.  
3Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, 
4chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
5SUMMARY
6This bill establishes the Automated Driving Safety Act, which provides standards for 
7the registration of automated vehicles, the licensure of automated vehicle operators and 
8the liability of the operators and providers of automated vehicles, including:
91. Defining a provider for an automated vehicle as an individual, organization or joint 
10enterprise that controls an automated driving system of an automated vehicle for testing 
11or deployment of the automated vehicle on a public way;
122. Requiring the Secretary of State to record on the automated vehicle's registration 
13that the vehicle is an automated vehicle and the identity of the provider for the automated 
14vehicle;
153. Requiring the Secretary of State to terminate the registration or refuse to register or 
16renew a registration of an automated vehicle that has been modified or has had its 
17automated driving system modified or that the Secretary of State determines is unsafe or 
18unfit for operation on a public way;
194.  Providing that the automated vehicle has 2 operators, an individual operator when 
20the automated driving system is not engaged and the provider as the operator when the 
21automated driving system is engaged, and, under most instances, that the applicable 
22operator is responsible for the proper operation of the automated vehicle and is liable for 
23an infraction, offense or negligence resulting in bodily injury, death or property damage; 
24and
255.  Requiring, if an automated vehicle is involved in an accident while the automated 
26driving system is engaged, that pursuant to the provisions of law regarding motor vehicle 
27accident reports, the automated vehicle not be moved and that the provider immediately 
28contact the applicable law enforcement agency, inform the law enforcement agency that 
29the automated driving system was engaged at the time of the accident and transmit 
30electronically or by the fastest means available the financial responsibility information 
31required for the vehicle.
