1 to a minor or allow a minor under that person's control or in a place under that person's 
2 control to possess or consume a tobacco product. This provision does not apply to a 
3 licensee under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 262-A or an agent of that 
4 licensee in the scope of employment. Current law provides that a person is guilty of 
5 endangering the welfare of a child if the person knowingly sells, furnishes, gives away or 
6 offers to sell, furnish or give away cigarettes to a child under 16 years of age. This 
7 amendment instead makes the same conduct illegal with respect to a tobacco product.
