Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
This legislation requires school counselors and school social workers to spend at least 80% of their time providing 
direct or indirect services to students but does not address how the time spent providing these services will be tracked. 
This fiscal note assumes that the process will be infonnal and will not require extensive recordkeeping and reporting. 
However, if the major substantive rules adopted by the department and submitted to the Legislature for review include 
a fonnal time recording and reporting process, the fiscal impact to local school administrative units for the additional 
requirement will need to be addressed. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with the rulemaking process can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
