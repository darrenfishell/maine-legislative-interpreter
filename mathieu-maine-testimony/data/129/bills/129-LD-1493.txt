15SUMMARY
16This bill amends the laws regarding games of chance conducted and regulated 
17pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17, chapter 62, including the following.
181.  It provides a definition of "bona fide charitable organization" to include entities 
19such as fire departments and political, recreational and patriotic organizations, as long as 
20those entities have tax-exempt status under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 
211986, are licensed as charitable organizations under the Charitable Solicitations Act and 
22are corporations in good standing with the Secretary of State.
232.  It provides a definition of "game of chance and skill" for the purpose of 
24distinguishing a game that requires the skillful exercise of judgment to influence the 
25outcome of a game from a game of chance, which is a game in which chance influences 
26the outcome in a manner that cannot be eliminated through the application of skill.
273.  It provides that a game of chance and skill that is conducted by a bona fide 
28charitable organization is exempt from licensing and other regulation.
294.  It provides that a game of chance and skill that is conducted by a person that is not 
30a bona fide charitable organization is treated in the same manner, for purposes of 
31regulation and licensing, as a game of chance.
325.  It removes the cap on the maximum number of players allowed in tournament 
33games and requires prizes to be paid by check.
346.  It removes the specific regulation of cribbage tournaments and the exceptions for 
35cribbage tournaments, since they will either not be regulated if conducted by a bona fide 
Page 8 - 129LR1635(01)-11charitable organization or will be subject to the same regulation as other tournament 
2games if conducted by an organization that is not a bona fide charitable organization.
37.  It removes the requirement that the Department of Public Safety, Gambling 
4Control Unit adopt rules that regulate undesirable activities and conduct of organizations 
5established primarily to operate games but that do not have a bona fide nonprofit 
6charitable, educational, political, civic, recreational, fraternal, patriotic, religious or public 
7safety purpose.
