The bill makes several changes to the Retired County and Municipal Law Enforcement Officers and Municipal 
Firefighters Health Insurance Program, including increasing the State subsidy of premiums from 45% to 55%, 
allowing eligible employees more time to enroll in the program and allowing certain enrollees to join the State 
Employee Health Plan (SEHP). The SEHP currently contributes about $524,000 to meet the requirement of 
subsidizing 45% of premiums and will require $181,000 to subsidize 55%, after accounting for an anticipated increase 
in health premiums for this population. This change is not effective until July 1, 2021 and any costs will occur in a 
future fiscal biennium. 
Currently, eligible employees must choose to enroll within 60 days of being hired. If an employee enrolls, 1.5% of 
their gross wages are sent to the Firefighters and Law Enforcement Officers Health Insurance Program Fund. For 
employees hired on or after October 1, 2019, the bill allows an employee to enroll in the program within 5 years, but 
would require the employee to contribute 2% of gross wages from the effective date of hire to the date the employee 
enrolls in the program, after which the enrollee will contribute 1.5% to the fund. This would result in an increase in 
revenues collected by the fund, but no estimate is available at this time since it is unknown how many employees will 
enroll. 
Last, including additional persons in the SEHP could result in increased costs to the plan, depending on the 
demographics and claim histories of those who join the plan. Any costs would likely be reflected through changes in 
premium amounts in future fiscal years.
