25coverage for maternity services shall provide coverage for abortion services for an 
26enrollee in accordance with this section.
272.  Limits; deductible; copayment; coinsurance.  A health plan that provides

20Sec. 6.  Application.  That section of this Act that enacts the Maine Revised 
21Statutes, Title 24-A, section 4320-L applies to all policies, contracts and certificates 
22executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State on or after 
23January 1, 2020.  For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be renewed no 
24later than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.
