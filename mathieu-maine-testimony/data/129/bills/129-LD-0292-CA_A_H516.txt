Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 7 MRSA §2964 is enacted to read: 
§2964. Donations of fresh milk to food banks 
The minimum price provisions of this chapter do not apply to donations of fresh milk 
produced and processed within the State by a dealer or producer-dealer to an incorporated 
nonprofit organization within the State established for the purpose of reducing hunger and 
increasing food security. Donations under this section may occur only if the fresh milk 
produced and processed within the State to be donated does not have a wholesale or retail 
market that will provide a higher monetary value to the dealer or producer-dealer.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Pait letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report, strikes and replaces the bill. The 
amendment exempts from the Maine Milk Commission's minimum price requirements 
donations of fresh milk produced and processed within the State by a dealer or producer­
dealer to an incorporated nonprofit organization in the State established for the purpose of 
reducing hunger and increasing food security. The amendment also provides that these 
donations may occur only if the fresh milk produced and processed within the State to be 
donated does not have a wholesale or retail market that will provide a higher monetary 
value to the dealer or producer-dealer.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill exempts fresh milk produced and processed in the State that is donated to nonprofit organizations 
established for the purpose of reducing hunger and increasing food security from the minimum price requirements of 
the Maine Milk Commission (MMC), if the donation does not have a wholesale or retail market that will provide a 
higher monetary value to the producer-dealer of fresh milk. Any additional costs to the MMC within the Department 
of Agriculture, Conservation and Foresty resulting from this exemption are anticipated to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
