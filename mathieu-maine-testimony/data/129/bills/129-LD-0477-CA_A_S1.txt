This bill establishes the Federal Shutdown Loan Guarantee Program Fund (the Fund) within the Office of Treasurer of 
State. The Fund will be used to guarantee the repayment ofup to 10% of the amount of loans made by eligible 
financial institutions to Maine residents who are federal employees going without pay during any full or partial 
government shutdown between February 15, 2019 and December 31, 2019 that lasts longer than 14 days. The bill 
allows loans up to a maximum of the lesser of$5,000 or an individual's most recent monthly after-tax pay reduced by 
any unemployment compensation benefits. Individuals are eligible to apply for up to 3 loans under the program. Given 
that there are approximately 1,200 federal employees residing in Maine and assuming that each receives $5,000 for 
each of 3 loans, the maximum potential liability to the State from this bill is $1,800,000 if every single loan recipient 
defaulted on their loans. However, the actual loan default rate is expected to be quite small, the average amount of 
loans will be less than $5,000 and many may choose not to apply for 3 loans. Accordingly, the bill provides a one-time 
transfer of $250,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the Fund and it 
includes an allocation of $250,000 to the Office of Treasurer of State to allow expenditures from the Fund. If this 
amount is not sufficient to cover the State's liability, additional funding will be required. The bill also includes a $500 
Other Special Revenue Funds allocation beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to expend any remaining funds from the 
transfer in future years. Administrative costs incutTed by the. Office of Treasurer of State can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources. 
LR2261(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
Because this legislation includes a provision that allows the Finance Authority or Maine (FAME) to retain a portion 
of the funds it recovers from loans in default to pay for its costs to administer the loan guarantee program, FAME will 
not require a General Fund appropriation. However, this provision will reduce the amount of funds returned to the 
Federal Shutdown Loan Guarantee Program Fund from the recovery of defaulted loans. 
Any additional costs to the Bureau of Financial Institutions within the Department of Professional and Financial 
Regulation to implement the provisions of this bill are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
