This bill requires certain governmental entities when issuing permits or licenses and setting rates to evaluate the 
negative externalities resulting from unique uses of water, such as the bulk exp01tation of water out of a region. The 
Department of Health and Human Services is charged with staffing, creating, implementing and administering a 
regulatory structure for determining "inequities" and defending decisions from appeals, including the costs associated 
with support from the Attorney General during appeals and potential litigation. Although no cost estimate can be made 
until the DHHS has developed a plan to implement the provisions of the bill, the costs are expected to be significant. 
The Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Depattment of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry have indicated that provisions in the bill related to consideration of externalities may be 
difficult to quantify in the regulatory process and may require additional expenditures to incorporate. Again, no cost 
estimate can be made until a more concrete plan of implementation is developed.
