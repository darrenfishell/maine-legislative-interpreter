Page 3 - 129LR2282(01)-11B.  The commission or its delegated commissioner or investigator shall conduct such 
2preliminary investigation as it determines necessary to determine whether there are 
3reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred. In 
4conducting an investigation, the commission, or its designated representative, must 
5have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and 
6other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy 
7those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are 
8reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The commission may 
9issue subpoenas to compel access to or production of those materials or the 
10appearance of those persons, subject to section 4566, subsections 4-A and 4-B, and 
11may serve interrogatories on a respondent to the same extent as interrogatories served 
12in aid of a civil action in the Superior Court. The commission may administer oaths. 
13The complaint and evidence collected during the investigation of the complaint, other 
14than data identifying persons not parties to the complaint and other information 
15designated as confidential in subsection 1-A, is a matter of public record at the 
16conclusion of the investigation of the complaint prior to a determination by the 
17commission.  An investigation is concluded upon issuance of a letter of dismissal or 
18upon listing of the complaint on a published commission meeting agenda, whichever 
19first occurs.  Prior to the conclusion of an investigation, all information possessed by 
20the commission relating to the investigation is confidential and may not be disclosed, 
21except that the commission and its employees have discretion to disclose such 
22information as is reasonably necessary to further the investigation.  Notwithstanding 
23any other provision of this section, the complaint and evidence collected during the 
24investigation of the complaint may be used as evidence in any subsequent 
25proceeding, civil or criminal.  The commission must conclude an investigation under 
26this paragraph within 2 years after the complaint is filed with the commission.
271-A.  Confidential documents.  The following information collected during the 
28investigation of a complaint pursuant to this section is confidential and may not be 
29disclosed except to the parties to a complaint, the commission and its federal partner 
30agencies or in a subsequent civil or criminal legal action:
31A.  Medical, counseling, psychiatric and other confidential health records;
32B.  Social security numbers;
33C.  Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise settlement negotiations, 
34offers of settlement and final agreements made prior to the conclusion of the 
35investigative process;
36D.  Names of minor children;
37E.  Any information the commission is required to keep confidential pursuant to 
38work-sharing agreements with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity 
39Commission, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or 
40any other federal partner agencies;
41F.  Criminal history record information that is not otherwise made public by law;
42G.  Personnel records and personal information that has been made confidential by 
43law;
Page 4 - 129LR2282(01)-11H.  Notes made by the investigator for the investigator's private use in assessing 
2evidence gathered during an investigation; and
3I.  Any other records that are not public records in accordance with Title 1, section 
4402.
5Documents containing information set forth in this subsection are not "public records," as 
6defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3, and do not become a matter of public record 
7under this section.
82.  Order of dismissal. If the commission does not find reasonable grounds to 
9believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred, it shall enter an order so finding, and 
10dismiss the proceeding. 
112-A.  Administrative dismissal.  The executive director of the commission may 
12administratively dismiss a complaint for reasons including, but not limited to:
13A.  Lack of jurisdiction;
14B.  Failure to substantiate the complaint of discrimination;
15C.  Failure to file a complaint of discrimination within 300 days of the date of alleged 
16discrimination; 
17D.  Failure by complainant to proceed or cooperate with the investigation, including 
18but not limited to a complainant's repeated or egregious failure to abide by the 
19commission's confidentiality requirements;
20E.  Bankruptcy filing by respondent; or
21F.  Death of a complainant, if no person with legal authority to continue the case 
22appears on that person's own behalf or on behalf of the complainant's estate within a 
23reasonable time.
24An administrative dismissal operates as an order of dismissal and has the same effect as a 
25finding by the commission that no reasonable grounds exist to believe that unlawful 
26discrimination has occurred.
273.  Informal methods, conciliation.  If the commission finds reasonable grounds to 
28believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred, but finds no emergency of the sort 
29contemplated in subsection 4, paragraph B, it shall endeavor to eliminate such 
30discrimination by informal means such as conference, conciliation and persuasion. 
31Everything said or done as part of such endeavors is confidential and may not be 
32disclosed without the written consent of the parties to the proceeding, nor used as 
33evidence in any subsequent proceeding, civil or criminal, except in a civil action alleging 
34a breach of agreement filed by the commission or a party.  Any post-finding conciliation 
35agreement that includes the commission as a signatory is a public record.  
36Notwithstanding this subsection, the commission and its employees have discretion to 
37disclose such information to a party as is reasonably necessary to facilitate conciliation. If 
38the case is disposed of by such informal means in a manner satisfactory to a majority of 
39the commission, it shall dismiss the proceeding. 
Page 5 - 129LR2282(01)-114.  Civil action by commission.  The commission may file a civil action in 
2accordance with this subsection.
3A.  If the commission finds reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful 
4discrimination has occurred, and further believes that irreparable injury or great 
5inconvenience will be caused the victim of such discrimination or to members of a 
6racial, color, sex, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, religious or 
7nationality group or age protected class group if relief is not immediately granted, or 
8if conciliation efforts under subsection 3 have not succeeded, the commission may 
9file in the Superior Court a civil action seeking such relief as is appropriate, including 
10temporary restraining orders.  In a complaint investigated pursuant to a memorandum 
11of understanding between the commission and the United States Department of 
12Housing and Urban Development that results in a reasonable grounds determination, 
13the commission shall file a civil action for the use of complainant if conciliation 
14efforts under subsection 3 are unsuccessful.
15B.    Grounds for the filing of such an action before attempting conciliation include, 
16but are not limited to: 
17(1)  In unlawful housing discrimination, that the housing accommodation sought 
18is likely to be sold or rented to another during the pendency of proceedings, or 
19that an unlawful eviction is about to occur; 
20(2)  In unlawful employment discrimination, that the victim of the discrimination 
21has lost or is threatened with the loss of job and income as a result of such 
22discrimination; 
23(3)  In unlawful public accommodations discrimination, that such discrimination 
24is causing inconvenience to many persons; 
25(4)  In any unlawful discrimination, that the victim of the discrimination is 
26suffering or is in danger of suffering severe financial loss in relation to 
27circumstances, severe hardship or personal danger as a result of such 
28discrimination.
295.  Confidentiality of 3rd-party records.  The Legislature finds that persons who 
30are not parties to a complaint under this chapter as a complainant or a respondent have a 
31right to privacy. Any records of the commission that are open to the public under Title 1, 
32chapter 13, must be kept in such a manner as to ensure that data identifying these 3rd 
33parties is not reflected in the record.  Only data reflecting the identity of these persons 
34may be kept confidential.
356.  Right to sue.  If, within 180 days of a complaint being filed with the commission, 
36the commission has not filed a civil action in the case or has not entered into a 
37conciliation agreement in the case, the complainant may request a right-to-sue letter, and, 
38if a letter is given, the commission shall end its investigation.  The executive director of 
39the commission may issue a right-to-sue letter in any case in which the commission has 
40not filed a civil action in the case or has not entered into a conciliation agreement in the 
41case within 180 days of the complaint being filed, whether or not such a letter has been 
42requested by the complainant.

6private person may not be awarded attorney's fees and costs and is not liable to pay any 
7party's attorney's fees and costs.
