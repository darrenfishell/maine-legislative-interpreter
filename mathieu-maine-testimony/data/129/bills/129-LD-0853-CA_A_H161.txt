SUMMARY 
This amendment permits retailers licensed for on-premises consumption of malt 
liquor to purchase malt liquor from retailers licensed for the sale of malt liquor to be 
consumed off the licensed premises only during weekend hours and only 2 times 
annually. If an on-premises retailer purchases malt liquor from an off-premises retailer, 
the on-premises retailer must immediately notify both the Department of Administrative 
and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations and the 
retailer's malt liquor wholesaler of the purchase. The on-premises retailer may not 
purchase more than 10 gallons of malt liquor in a single weekend and must purchase the 
malt liquor from an off-premises retailer located within the same malt liquor wholesaler's 
sales territory.
