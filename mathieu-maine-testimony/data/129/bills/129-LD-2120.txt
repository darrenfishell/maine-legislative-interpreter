Page 1 - 129LR3154(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law requires that a municipality hold a referendum to authorize 
4the sale of liquor in that municipality; and
5Whereas, current law requires the county commissioners for an unincorporated 
6place to determine whether or not to authorize the sale of liquor in that unincorporated 
7place; and
8Whereas, based upon the affirmative referendum or decision, the Department of 
9Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
10Operations is authorized to issue a license to a qualified establishment in that 
11municipality or unincorporated place; and
12Whereas, the bureau has recently become aware that it does not have proof of a 
13referendum or decision in some municipalities and unincorporated places that have 
14licensed establishments, endangering the ability of these currently licensed businesses to 
15continue to be licensed by the bureau; and
16Whereas, it is imperative that this legislation take effect as soon as possible to avoid 
17irreparable harm to businesses that have complied with all requirements but could lose 
18their licenses to sell liquor due to inadequate record keeping; and
19Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
20the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
21immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
22therefore,
23Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
24Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA §121, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 475, Pt. C, §8, is

29SUMMARY
30Current law requires a municipality through a local option election to affirmatively 
31authorize the licensing of businesses to sell liquor in that municipality.  In an 
32unincorporated place, the county commissioners must decide whether to authorize or not 
33authorize the licensing of businesses to sell liquor in that unincorporated place.  Based on 
34the type of sales authorized in that municipality or unincorporated place, the Department 
35of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
36Operations issues licenses to the establishments or agency liquor stores in that 
37municipality or unincorporated place.
38Since a municipality or unincorporated place may not be able to provide proof that 
39the sale of liquor was authorized in that municipality or unincorporated place, despite the 
40presence in that municipality or unincorporated place of establishments licensed by the 
Page 4 - 129LR3154(01)-11bureau, the continuation of licensing by the bureau is in jeopardy.  In order to prevent the 
2loss of licensing, this bill provides a window, until July 1, 2022, for a municipality or 
3unincorporated place to either provide the bureau with proof of an affirmative vote or 
4decision or to hold a local option election or, in the case of an unincorporated place, to 
5authorize the sale of liquor.  This bill requires the bureau, no later than October 1, 2020, 
6to notify a municipality or unincorporated place that has a business licensed by the bureau 
7in it that the bureau does not have a record of a local option vote or decision authorizing 
8the sale of liquor in that municipality or unincorporated place.  In order to continue as a 
9municipality or unincorporated place in which the sale of liquor is authorized, that 
10municipality or unincorporated place must either provide proof of a local option election 
11or decision authorizing the sale of liquor or, before July 1, 2022, hold a local option 
12election to authorize the sale of liquor or, in the case of an unincorporated place, decide 
13affirmatively to authorize the sale of liquor. Beginning July 1, 2022, if a municipality or 
14unincorporated place that has been notified of noncompliance fails to affirm the 
15authorization to sell liquor, the bureau is prohibited from licensing an establishment or 
16agency liquor store in that municipality or unincorporated place.  If the bureau fails to 
17notify by October 1, 2020 a municipality or unincorporated place in which there is a 
18business licensed by the bureau that the municipality or unincorporated place is in 
19noncompliance with the requirement to hold a local option election or issue a decision 
20authorizing the sale of liquor in that municipality or unincorporated place, then the bureau 
21may not fail to continue to license a business based on that noncompliance.
22This bill also makes the following changes to the laws regarding the authorization of 
23the sale of liquor in a municipality.
241.  It reduces the number of signatures of voters needed on a petition to hold a local 
25option election to determine whether the sale of liquor is authorized in a municipality 
26from 15% of the number of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in that 
27municipality to signatures of 30 voters in that municipality.
282.  It allows the municipal officers in a municipality to hold a local option election.
