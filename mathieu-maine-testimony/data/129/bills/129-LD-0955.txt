2This bill prohibits a person from performing or causing to be performed any oil or 
3natural gas exploration, development or production in, on or under the waters of the State 
4or that may adversely affect the waters of the State.
5The bill also prohibits the Department of Environmental Protection and the Director 
6of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
7and Forestry from permitting, approving or otherwise authorizing any oil or natural gas 
8exploration, development or production in, on or under the submerged and intertidal land 
9owned by the State.
10It is the intent of this legislation to generally prohibit activities relating to offshore oil 
11and natural gas exploration, development and production within the boundaries and 
12jurisdiction of the State, which place the State's coastal communities at economic and 
13ecological risk from oil spills, and from the pollution caused by routine drilling 
14operations and onshore industrialization, and threaten the quality of life and livelihoods 
15of Maine citizens and economically significant industries, including tourism, recreation 
16and commercial and recreational fishing, and small businesses that rely on a clean and 
17healthy ocean and clean and healthy beaches.
