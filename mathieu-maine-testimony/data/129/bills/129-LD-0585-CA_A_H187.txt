Trash on Private Property in Plantations' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §7051, sub-§11, as amended by PL 2017, c. 3, §1, is further 
amended to read: 
11. Ordinances. Chapter 141, but only with respect to animal control ordinances, 
subject to Title 7, section 3950, and the sale and use of consumer fireworks within the 
plantation, subject to Title 8, section 223-A, and the accumulation of garbage, refuse, 
rubbish or trash or unwanted or discarded material of any kind or source on private 
property.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment limits the applicability of the bill to plantations. It removes 
reference to junkyards and automobile graveyards. It grants plantations the authority to 
enact ordinances with respect to the accumulation of garbage, refuse, rubbish or trash or 
unwanted or discarded material of any kind on private property.
