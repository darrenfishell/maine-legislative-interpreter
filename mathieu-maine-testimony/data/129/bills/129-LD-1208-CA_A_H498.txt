Allowing detectives employed in the Office of the Attorney General on or after July 1, 2020 to participate in the 1998 
Special Plan of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System will increase both the normal cost and unfunded 
actuarial liability components of the employer retirement rate, resulting in increased employer contributions to the 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System for detectives beginning in fiscal year 2020-21. 
This legislation includes a transition provision for those detectives hired by the Office of the Attorney General prior to 
July 1, 2020 which allows these employees to elect to pmticipate in the 1998 Special Plan by September 30, 2020. 
Based on an analysis performed by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System, this fiscal note assumes that 7 of 
the 12 eligible detectives (including one new detective position proposed to be added in the 2020-2021 biennial 
budget) will elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan as soon as the option becomes available and the remaining 
detectives will opt to stay in the State Regular Plan. 
The Office of the Attorney General has indicated that it will pay for the cost of this provision within its proposed 
budgeted resources for fiscal year 2020-21. This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $6,687 in fiscal year 
2020-21, a Federal Expenditures Fund allocation of $13,494 in fiscal year 2020-21 and an Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocation of $3,598 in fiscal year 2020-21 to the Personal Services line category and a corresponding 
deappropriation and deallocations to the All Other line category to the Administration -Attorney General program 
within the Office of the Attorney General to self-fund the cost in fiscal year 2020-21. 
If any of the detectives hired by the Office of the Attorney General prior to July 1, 2020 who choose to remain in the 
State Regular Plan eventually retire or otherwise vacate their positions, any newly hired detectives will be placed in 
the 1998 Special Plan. The additional cost to the Office of the Attorney General to fill these positions at the higher 
employer contribution rate is estimated to be between $2,000 and $3,000 per position annually. When this additional 
cost will be incurred and which funds will be impacted can not be determined at this time.
