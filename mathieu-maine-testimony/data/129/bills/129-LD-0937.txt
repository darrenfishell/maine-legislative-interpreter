6SUMMARY
7This bill amends the State's litter law to provide that a person who releases  or 
8abandons a balloon outdoors is subject to penalties under that law regarding the waste 
9materials resulting from that release or abandonment.  It also requires a seller of balloons 
10to register with the Department of Environmental Protection and to display in a 
11conspicuous place at each purchase counter warning information developed by the 
12department concerning the risks to the environment and to wildlife posed by waste 
13materials resulting from the outdoor release of balloons; the choking and suffocation risks 
14to children posed by the unsupervised use of balloons; the risks to individuals with latex 
15allergies posed by exposure to balloons made wholly or partly from latex; and the 
16penalties for littering resulting from the outdoor release of balloons that may be imposed 
17by the State's litter laws.
18The intent of this legislation is to prevent the release into the environment of balloons 
19that pose a danger and a nuisance to the environment, particularly to wildlife and marine 
20animals, and that cause hardship for the municipalities that must clean up the debris from 
21balloons.
