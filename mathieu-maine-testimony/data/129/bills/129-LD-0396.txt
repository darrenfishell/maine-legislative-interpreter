3amended to read:
43.  Completed kit.  If the alleged victim has not reported the alleged offense to a law 
5enforcement agency when the examination is complete, the hospital or health care 
6practitioner shall then notify the nearest law enforcement agency, which shall transport 
7and store the completed forensic examination kit for at least 90 days a period of time 
8equal to the period of limitations under Title 17-A, section 8 for the underlying crime 
9under Title 17-A, chapter 11.  The completed kit may be identified only by the tracking 
10number.  If during that 90-day storage period an alleged victim decides to report the 
11alleged offense to a law enforcement agency, the alleged victim may contact the hospital 
12or health care practitioner to determine the tracking number.  The hospital or health care 
13practitioner shall provide the alleged victim with the tracking number on the forensic 
14examination kit and shall inform the alleged victim which law enforcement agency is 
15storing the kit.
16If the alleged victim reports the alleged offense to a law enforcement agency by the time 
17the examination is complete, the investigating agency shall retain custody of the forensic 
18examination kit.  Except for when the forensic examination kit is being processed or 
19analyzed by a 3rd party or unless preservation is required by Title 15, section 2138, 
20subsection 14, the investigating agency shall store the forensic examination kit for a 
21period of time equal to the period of limitations under Title 17-A, section 8 for the 
22underlying crime under Title 17-A, chapter 11 or until the underlying crime is prosecuted 
23and a conviction is obtained, whichever comes first.
24If an examination is performed under subsection 5 and the alleged victim does not, within 
2560 days, regain a state of consciousness adequate to decide whether or not to report the 
26alleged offense, the State may file a motion in the District Court relating to storing or 
27processing the forensic examination kit.  Upon finding good cause and after considering 
28factors, including, but not limited to, the possible benefits to public safety in processing 
29the kit and the likelihood of the alleged victim's regaining a state of consciousness 
30adequate to decide whether or not to report the alleged offense in a reasonable time, the 
31District Court may order either that the kit be stored for additional time or that the kit be 
32transported to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory for processing, or such other 
33disposition that the court determines just.  In the interests of justice or upon motion by the 
34State, the District Court may conduct hearings required under this paragraph 
35confidentially and in camera and may impound pleadings and other records related to 
36them.

43agency shall transport the completed forensic examination kit, identified only by a

2law enforcement agency shall store the forensic examination kit for at least 90 days from 
3the time of receipt a period of time equal to the period of limitations under Title 17-A, 
4section 8 for the underlying crime under Title 17-A, chapter 11.  If during that 90-day

6investigating agency shall take possession of the forensic examination kit.  Except for 
7when the forensic examination kit is being processed or analyzed by a 3rd party or unless 
8preservation is required by Title 15, section 2138, subsection 14, the investigating agency 
9shall store the forensic examination kit for a period of time equal to the period of 
10limitations under Title 17-A, section 8 for the underlying crime under Title 17-A, chapter 
1111 or until the underlying crime is prosecuted and a conviction is obtained, whichever 
12comes first.
