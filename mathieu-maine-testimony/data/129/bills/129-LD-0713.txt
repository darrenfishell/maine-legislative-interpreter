15SUMMARY
16This bill gives a law enforcement officer discretion in issuing a warning to a first-
17time violator of the State's laws prohibiting negligently feeding, baiting or harassing an 
18endangered or threatened species or feeding, baiting or harassing a delisted species.  It 
19removes the requirement that a law enforcement officer must issue a warning to a first-
20time violator of the law prohibiting intentionally feeding, baiting or harassing an 
21endangered or threatened species.
22It increases from Class E crimes to Class D crimes negligently importing, exporting, 
23hunting, taking, trapping, possessing, processing, selling, offering for sale, delivering, 
24carrying, transporting, shipping, feeding, baiting or harassing endangered or threatened 
25species.  It also increases from Class D crimes to Class C crimes intentionally engaging in 
26any of those acts with endangered, threatened and delisted species.
