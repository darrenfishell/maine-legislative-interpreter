19of State to create a separate voter instruction poster for ranked-choice voting.  This bill 
20provides that municipalities count and report only the first choice votes cast for elections 
21determined by ranked-choice voting.  This bill substitutes the word "count" for the word 
22"tabulate" in reference to ranked-choice voting.  This bill removes an inconsistent 
23provision regarding ties in ranked-choice contests and changes the permitted restriction 
24on the number of rankings allowed on the ballot in a ranked-choice voting contest from 6 
25to 5.  This bill limits who can request a recount of a ranked-choice voting contest to the 
26candidates receiving the top 3 rankings in the penultimate round of ranked-choice 
27counting.
