3further amended to read:
41.  Death of employee; date of injury prior to January 1, 2013.  If an injured 
5employee's date of injury is prior to January 1, 2013 and if death results from the injury of 
6the employee, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the dependents of the 
7employee who were wholly dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the 
8time of the injury a weekly payment equal to 80% of the employee's after-tax average 
9weekly wage, but not more than the maximum benefit under section 211, for a period of 
10500 weeks from the date of death.  If the employee leaves dependents only partially 
11dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the time of injury, the employer 
12shall pay weekly compensation equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for 
13the benefit of persons wholly dependent, as 80% of the amount contributed by the 
14employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the 
15time of injury.  If, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially 
16dependent person is less than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause 
17to be paid the weekly compensation until that person reaches the age of 18.
18If a dependent spouse dies or becomes a dependent of another person, the payments must 
19cease upon the payment to the spouse of the balance of the compensation to which the 
20spouse would otherwise have been entitled but in no event to exceed the sum of $500.00.  
21The remaining weeks of compensation, if any, are is payable to those persons either 
22wholly or partially dependent upon the employee for support at the employee's death.  
23When, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any wholly or partially dependent person 
24is less than 18 years of age, the employer shall continue to pay or cause to be paid the 
25weekly compensation, until that person reaches the age of 18.  The payment of 
26compensation to any dependent child after the expiration of the 500-week period ceases 
27when the child reaches the age of 18 years, if at the age of 18 years the child is neither 
28physically nor mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child reaches the age of 
2916 years and thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months.  If the child ceases to be self-
30supporting thereafter, the dependency must be reinstated.  As long as any of the 500 
31weeks of compensation remain, and that compensation is payable to the person either 
32wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time of the 
33employee's death, with the exception of a dependent spouse who becomes a dependent of 
34another.  If a wholly dependent or partially dependent child who reaches 18 years of age 
35is either physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be unable to earn a living as 
36determined by the board, the payments must continue until such time as the child either 
37dies or is no longer physically or mentally incapacitated from earning.

26employee's death, with the exception of a dependent spouse who becomes a dependent of 
27another.  If a wholly dependent or partially dependent child who reaches 18 years of age 
28is either physically or mentally incapacitated so as to be unable to earn a living as 
29determined by the board, the payments must continue until such time as the child either

33governing workers' compensation.  This bill removes the 500-week cap.
