10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment adds 2 members to the Victims' Compensation Board, amends its 
12 quorum from 2 to 3 members and clarifies that the board performs the duties assigned to 
13 it under the victims' property compensation program beginning July 1, 2022. The 
14 amendment allows the board to compensate a victim of a crime up to $1,000 for property 
15 losses or insurance deductibles paid pursuant to an insurance claim as a result of the 
16 property loss. The amendment provides July 1, 2022 as the date on which the board is 
17 authorized to begin to process or pay claims. The amendment removes from the bill the 
18 prohibition on the court's waiving the imposition of the assessment that funds the Victims' 
19 Property Compensation Fund. The amendment removes from the bill eligibility for an 
20 award for a person who is the victim of a crime that occurred in another state or a crime 
21 of terrorism that occurred outside of the country. The amendment provides for 
22 rulemaking for the Victims' Property Compensation Fund and designates rules for both 
23 this fund and the Victims' Compensation Fund as routine technical rules. The amendment 
24 amends the law on restitution for victims of a crime so that, once a victim has been 
25 compensated as allowed by law from either fund or a combination of a fund and 
26 restitution, any additional restitution payments are paid into the applicable fund. The 
27 provisions of law incorporating the Victims' Property Compensation Fund into the duties 
28 of the Victims' Compensation Board and increasing the membership of that board do not 
29 apply until July 1, 2022.

This bill creates the Victims Property Compensation Fund, which will be overseen by the existing Victims 
Compensation Board, to compensate victims of crimes in which the victims suffered property losses. Revenue will 
come from a $10 assessment on any person convicted of murder or a Class A, B or C crime, and a $5 assessment on 
any person convicted of a Class D or E crime. Over the past three years there were an average of 4,346 Class A, B and 
C convictions annually and 37,185 Class D and E convictions annually. It is estimated that $230,000 in revenues will 
be generated annually for the fund beginning January 1 2020. 
The judicial branch has indicated assessing an additional fee would require one-time technology related modifications 
to its current revenue collection software. The bill includes one-time General Fund appropriations to the judicial 
branch of $10,000 in fiscal year 2020. Any ongoing costs related to assessing the additional fee can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. 
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has indicated it would require an additional Research Assistant MSEA-B 
Position to support the expanded functions of the Victims Compensation Board. As the bill authorizes the board to 
begin paying claims in fiscal year 2022-23, the position would not be needed until fiscal year 2022-23. Also, the bill 
adds two additional members to the Victims Compensation Board beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 and members are 
entitled to per diem plus compensation for actual and necessary expenses, estimated to be $1,320 annually. 
Accordingly, the OAG will require ongoing allocations of approximately $83,000 for personal services and other 
costs beginning in fiscal year 2022-23.
