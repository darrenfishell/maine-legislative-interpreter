SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes and replaces the title and bill. 
Like the bill, this amendment allows a person with a student lobster and crab fishing 
license to fish for or take lobster during a closed season on fishing for or taking lobsters if 
that closed season occurs during an interim between school years, except this amendment 
limits the permission to a student license holder issued trap tags to fish only in the 
Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area who may fish only during the closed season in the 
Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area. This amendment retains the number of Monhegan 
Lobster Conservation Area trap tags that may be issued by the commissioner to a student 
license holder at 15 for a student license holder 8 years of age or older and under 14 years 
of age and increases from 15 to 25 the number of trap tags issued to a student license 
holder 14 years of age or older and under 23 years of age. 
This amendment also adds an emergency preamble and clause so that it will take 
effect in time for a Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area student license holder to fish 
for lobster during the summer months.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill allows the holder of a student lobster and crab fishing license who has been issued trap tags to fish in the 
Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area (MLCA) during the closed season if that closed season occurs during an 
interim between school years. The bill also specifies that the age of the licensee determines the number of trap tags 
issued to student lobster and crab fishing licensees who fish in the MLCA. Due to the limited number of student 
lobster and crab fishing licensees who fish in the MLCA, any additional costs to the Department of Marine 
Resources to implement the provisions of this bill are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
