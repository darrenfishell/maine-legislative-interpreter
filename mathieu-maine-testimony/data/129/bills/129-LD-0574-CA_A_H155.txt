This bill would add filing a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Comt to the services provided by the Maine 
Conunission on Indigent Legal Services. The Commission estimates about 3 to 7 instances per year that a petition 
would be filed. Assuming a petition takes 40 hours of time to prepare, each petition would cost the Commission 
$2,400. As a result, costs to the Cmmnission could total $7,200 to $16,800 per year, averaging $12,000 per year. The 
bill includes appropriations of $9,000 in FY 2019-20 and $12,000 in FY 2020-21.
