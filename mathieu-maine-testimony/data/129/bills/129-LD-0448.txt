Page 1 - 129LR1799(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §683, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 478, §1, is further 
3amended to read:
41.  Exemption amount.  Except for assessments for special benefits, the just value of 
5$10,000 of the homestead of a permanent resident of this State who has owned a 
6homestead in this State for the preceding 12 months is exempt from taxation.  
7Notwithstanding this subsection, a permanent resident of this State who loses ownership 
8of a homestead in this State due to a tax lien foreclosure and subsequently regains 
9ownership of the homestead from the municipality that foreclosed on the tax lien is 
10deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be determined ineligible 
11for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of the homestead by the 
12municipality.  In determining the local assessed value of the exemption, the assessor shall 
13multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current just value upon which the 
14assessment is based as furnished in the assessor's annual return pursuant to section 383.  
15If the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in common with others, the 
16exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the homestead, but may be 
17apportioned among the owners who reside on the property to the extent of their respective 
18interests.  A municipality responsible for administering the homestead exemption has no 
19obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest in a homestead owned 
20jointly or in common.
21Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §942, 3rd ¶, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 478, §2, is repealed.
22Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §943-C, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 478, §3, is repealed.
23Sec. 4.  36 MRSA §1281, as amended by PL 2017, c. 478, §4, is further amended 
24to read:
25§1281.  Payment of taxes; delinquent taxes; publication; certificate filed in registry
26Taxes on real estate mentioned in section 1602, including supplementary taxes 
27assessed under section 1331, are delinquent on the 15th day of January next following the 
28date of assessment.  Annually, on or before February 1st, the State Tax Assessor shall 
29send by mail to the last known address of each owner of such real estate upon which 
30taxes remain unpaid a notice in writing, containing a description of the real estate 
31assessed and the amount of unpaid taxes and interest, and alleging that a lien is claimed 
32on that real estate for payment of those taxes, interests and costs, with a demand that 
33payment be made by the next February 21st.  For property that constitutes a homestead 
34for which a property tax exemption is claimed under chapter 105, subchapter 4-B, the 
35State Tax Assessor shall include in the written notice written notice to the owner named 
36on the tax lien mortgage that that owner may be eligible to file an application for tax 
37abatement under section 841, subsection 2, indicating that the State Tax Assessor, upon 
38request, will assist the owner in requesting an abatement and provide information 
39regarding the procedures for making such a request.  The notice must also indicate that 
40the owner may seek assistance from the Department of Professional and Financial 
41Regulation, Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection regarding options for finding an 
Page 2 - 129LR1799(01)-11advisor who can help the owner work with the State Tax Assessor to avoid tax lien 
2foreclosure and provide information regarding ways to contact the bureau.  The 
3Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Consumer Credit 
4Protection, by July 15th annually, shall provide to a statewide organization representing 
5municipalities and to the State Tax Assessor information regarding assistance in avoiding 
6tax lien foreclosure to assist municipalities and the State Tax Assessor in providing the 
7information required in the notice.  If the owners of any such real estate are unknown, 
8instead of sending the notices by mail, the assessor shall cause the information required in 
9this section on that real estate to be advertised in the state paper and in a newspaper, if 
10any, of general circulation in the county in which the real estate lies.  Such a statement or 
11advertisement is sufficient legal notice of delinquent taxes. If those taxes and interest to 
12date of payment and costs are not paid by February 21st, the State Tax Assessor shall 
13record by March 15th, in the registry of deeds of the county or registry district where the 
14real estate lies, a certificate signed by the assessor, setting forth the name or names of the 
15owners according to the last state valuation, or the valuation established in accordance 
16with section 1331; the description of the real estate assessed as contained in the last state 
17valuation, or the valuation established in accordance with section 1331; the amount of 
18unpaid taxes and interest; the amount of costs; and a statement that demand for payment 
19of those taxes has been made, and that those taxes, interest and costs remain unpaid.  The 
20costs charged by the register of deeds for the filing may not exceed the fees established 
21by Title 33, section 751.
22SUMMARY
23This bill removes the provisions enacted in Public Law 2017, chapter 478 that 
24established a preforeclosure process that municipalities must use in order to foreclose on 
25homestead property for nonpayment of property tax if the owner is 65 years of age or 
26older and has income and liquid assets below specified limits.
