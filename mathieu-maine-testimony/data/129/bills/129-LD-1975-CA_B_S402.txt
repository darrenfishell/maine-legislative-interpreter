1 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
2 section number to read consecutively. 
3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment is the minority report of the committee and replaces the bill. 
5 Like the bill, the amendment prohibits a health insurance carrier or dental insurer 
6 from imposing a waiting period for any dental or oral health service or treatment, except 
7 for orthodontic treatment, for an enrollee under 19 years of age. The bill allocates the 
8 prohibition to the Maine Insurance Code, chapter 56-A. The amendment allocates the 
9 prohibition to the appropriate chapters of the Maine Insurance Code to ensure the 
10 prohibition applies to stand-alone dental insurance plans and to health insurance plans 
11 that provide coverage for dental or oral health services. 
12 The amendment makes clear that the provisions apply to policies and contracts issued 
13 or renewed on or after January 1, 2021 and repeals the provisions in 2 years. 
14 The amendment also corrects a conflict created by Public Law 2019, chapters 274 
15 and 388, which affected the same provision oflaw.
