24SUMMARY
25This bill is the Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles' 
26omnibus bill.  The bureau is recommending several changes to the motor vehicle laws to 
27facilitate program administration and to bring administrative fees more in line with actual 
28costs.
29It amends the enforcement provision governing dealers, transporters and automobile 
30graveyards to change investigators to motor vehicle detectives to match the current job 
31title.
32It replaces the requirement that an applicant for an original motor vehicle registration 
33submit a dealer's certificate with the requirement that the applicant submit a properly 
34completed bill of sale.  It replaces the requirement that a municipal official retain from 
35the use taxes collected a fee of $1.25 for each vehicle with a requirement that the 
36Secretary of State be reimbursed by the State Tax Assessor $1.25 per use tax certificate 
37processed.  It requires registration certificates to be forwarded to the Secretary of State as 
38well as the State Tax Assessor.
Page 8 - 129LR2280(01)-11It amends the law allowing the Secretary of State to refuse to issue or to recall a 
2vanity plate having language that encourages violence or may result in an act of violence 
3or other unlawful activity to remove express language stating that it is the Secretary of 
4State who makes the finding regarding the language.
5It repeals the requirement that the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
6submit a new sportsman registration plate design every 6 years.
7It repeals the trailer transit plate provision from the law regarding temporary 
8registration plates and enacts the language of the provision in the law regarding special 
9dealer licenses and plates.  It makes a violation of that provision a traffic infraction and 
10specifies a trailer transit plate expires annually at the end of March.
11It removes the 10-year authorization period for recognition license plates.
12It reduces the minimum number of registrations required for eligibility for the 25-
13year permanent registration program for semitrailers from 30,000 to 20,000.
14It repeals the moratorium on commemorative veteran decals, which ran from October 
151, 2009 to October 1, 2014.
16It clarifies that International Registration Plan credentials may be presented in 
17electronic format.
18It changes the retention period for information pertaining to a scrapped vehicle from 
19one year to 5 years to bring it into compliance with the record requirements for salvage 
20vehicle recyclers. It adds an accuracy requirement to allow for a penalty for recyclers 
21who incorrectly record information for scrapped vehicles of model years 1995 to 1999 
22and makes a violation a traffic infraction.
23It amends the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 667, regarding salvage 
24vehicles, to change the reporting requirements due date in the provisions regarding 
25surrender and cancellation of a certificate of title or certificate of salvage from 
26"immediately" to within 30 days.  It adds scrap processors to the list of persons to whom 
27an owner must have transferred a vehicle for which a certificate of salvage has not been 
28issued in order for that vehicle to be deemed declared by the owner to be a salvage 
29vehicle.  It also allows a salvage dealer, recycler or scrap processor to retain possession of 
30a certificate of salvage until the recycler scraps or dismantles the vehicle and requires that 
3130 days after the scrapping or dismantling of the vehicle the certificate of title or 
32certificate of salvage must be delivered to the Secretary of State for cancellation.  It 
33repeals the current requirement regarding the surrender of the certificate of title or 
34certificate of salvage.
35It requires a salvage dealer, recycler or scrap processor to obtain the vehicle seller's 
36name and address from a government-issued photograph identification document or 
37credential.  It requires a licensed mobile crusher to maintain an operator log for each of 
38its locations, which must include the make, model, model year and vehicle identification 
39number of each vehicle crushed and the date of the action.
Page 9 - 129LR2280(01)-11It adds the requirement for recyclers to use the National Motor Vehicle Title 
2Information System as required by federal law and regulation.
3It provides for the issuance of a commercial learner's permit for one year.
4It provides a motorcycle driver education instructor a hearing pursuant to Title 29-A, 
5chapter 23, subchapter 2, article 3 when refused an instructor's license or the instructor's 
6license is suspended or revoked.
7It allows the Secretary of State to suspend, revoke or refuse to issue or renew a driver 
8education school or instructor license or deny a driver education program certificate of 
9completion for just cause or for noncompliance with statutory or regulatory requirements.
10It provides that a driver's license or nondriver identification card of a person under 21 
11years of age must bear a distinctive layout or marking rather than a distinctive color code.
12It eliminates the sticker designation for a deaf or hard-of-hearing person and replaces 
13it with a distinctive marker or code on the person's driver's license or nondriver 
14identification card.
15It clarifies that when any change is made to a driver's license, nondriver identification 
16card, registration certificate or learner's permit that requires that an updated credential be 
17issued, it is considered a duplicate for processing purposes.
18It includes vehicles of the Attorney General's office and the Secretary of State's office 
19in the definition of "police vehicle" in the law governing emergency and auxiliary lights.
20It removes the requirement that the Secretary of State report annually to the joint 
21standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters on 
22the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program.
