129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT "b " to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 
1167, L.D. 1615, Bill, "An Act To Enact Laws Governing Private Vehicle Rentals" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 in §7403 in subsection 4 by striking out all of 
paragraph A (page 3, lines 20 to 27 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
'A. Procure insurance coverage of the shared vehicle during the car sharing period. 
At a minimum, the insurance must provide: 
(1) Primary liability coverage for the shared vehicle owner and secondary 
liability coverage for the shared vehicle driver in an amount not less than 3 times 
the minimum requirements for liability in Title 29-A. section 1605; and 
(2) Beginning June 1, 2020, property and casualty coverage, including 
comprehensive and collision protection, for physical loss to the shared vehicle 
during the time that the vehicle is in the custody of the provider or shared vehicle 
driver in an amount not less than the replacement cost of the shared vehicle;' 
Amend the amendment by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter 
or section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the requirement for a peer-to-peer car sharing program 
provider to procure liability insurance coverage and specifies that the requirement for a 
peer-to-peer car sharing program provider to procure property and casualty coverage 
begins June 1, 2020. The amendment also replaces the requirement that property and 
casualty insurance coverage for physical loss to a shared vehicle be provided to the same 
extent that coverage for physical loss is provided under a shared vehicle owner's policy 
with a requirement that coverage be pro~ed in an amount not less than the replacement 
cost of a shared vehicle.
