Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium impact-All Funds 
Allowing employees of an academy approved for tuition purposes to be eligible for coverage under the state employee 
health insurance program could result in increased costs to an academy to cover the employer costs ofpa1iicipating in 
the program. Any potential costs to an academy will depend on the number of persons employed who elect for 
coverage and would be offset by elimination of costs from coverage already offered by an academy. According to data 
provided by the Depatiment of Education, there are currently 10 town academies that are approved for tuition 
purposes. These IO academies include 743 full time employees and 60 part time employees. 
Including additional persons in the state employee health insurance program could result in increased costs or savings 
to the plan depending on the demographics and claim histories of those who join the plan. Any costs or savings would 
likely be reflected through changes in premium amounts in future fiscal years.
