16services of an architect and construction manager for the project, the costs of which must 
17be included as a cost of the Biddeford courthouse design and construction project.
18Sec. 3.  Construction of York County facilities.  The judicial branch, working

20York County district attorney in Biddeford pursuant to section 1 using the funding

37SUMMARY
38This bill resolves logistical issues created by the construction of a consolidated 
39courthouse for York County in Biddeford.  Earlier legislation that authorized construction 
Page 2 - 129LR1158(01)-11of the courthouse did not factor in adequate space for the office of the district attorney, a 
2required component of the judicial process.  This bill provides for the construction of a 
3building of sufficient size to accommodate the office of the district attorney to be 
4connected to the new courthouse.  This bill authorizes the issuance of up to $6,000,000 in 
5Maine Government Facilities Authority securities to construct the building, but the 
6planning and design, a joint project by the judicial branch and York County, will be 
7covered by the existing funding of the courthouse.
8The goal of this bill is to make the new building as cost-neutral to the parties as 
9possible.  York County will pay the debt service on the bonds and pay annual rent for the 
10land of $1 until the debt service is fully paid, at which time the State will transfer the land 
11and building to York County for $1.  In addition, the 3 district court buildings vacated 
12when the new consolidated courthouse opens must be transferred at no cost to York 
13County for its exclusive use.
