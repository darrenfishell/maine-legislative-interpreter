11 SUMMARY 
12 The bill adds remedies for economic abuse to the relief a court may include in a 
13 protection from abuse order. This amendment makes revisions to the bill ensuring that it 
14 does not conflict with the federal Fair Credit Repo1iing Act, including provisions 
15 concerning identity theft, as well as modifying the monetary relief generally available to 
16 the court to allow the court broader discretion in addressing economic abuse issues. 
17 This amendment addresses concerns about preemption of state law by the federal Fair 
18 Credit Reporting Act and makes clear that a credit reporting agency's removal from a 
19 consumer's credit report of references to debt or any portion of a debt determined to be 
20 the result of economic abuse is not intended to conflict with federal law but complement 
21 the federal law and protect survivors of economic abuse when possible. The amendment 
22 requires the credit reporting agency to reinvestigate the debt, and if it is determined that 
23 the debt is the result of economic abuse, the credit reporting agency must remove 
24 reference to the debt, or any part determined to be the result of economic abuse, from the 
25 consumer's credit report. 
26 The amendment clarifies the definition of "economic abuse" to include both 
27 unauthorized and coerced use of credit, recognizing that there are already remedies for 
28 the crime of identity theft. This amendment is not intended to address identity theft, 
29 which is covered by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act in 15 United States Code, 
30 Section 168lc-2. Instead, the amendment includes, but is not limited to, the exploitative 
31 use of joint credit accounts without authorization by both joint owners and debt incurred 
32 through coercion. 
33 The amendment adds language to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 19-A, section 
34 4007, subsection 1 to ensure that it is clear that the abuse for which a plaintiff may seek 
35 the issuance of a protection from abuse order is what is defined as abuse in Title 19-A, 
36 section 4002, subsection 1. The bill does not add economic abuse as a type of conduct 
37 for which a protection from abuse order may be sought, although it does provide that if a 
38 protection from abuse order is issued, the court has expanded discretion to order 
39 appropriate monetary relief to help address the impact of any economic abuse that may be 
40 found by the court. The amendment makes clear that the court may make a finding of 
41 economic abuse. 
42 The amendment strikes from the bill language specific to economic abuse relief that 
43 may be included in a protection from abuse order and instead amends the current law

concerning monetary compensation. The amendment broadens the available relief by 
changing the monetary compensation in current law to monetary relief to the plaintiff that 
includes, but is not limited to, the existing types of relief and adds transitional living 
expenses, which are often necessary for plaintiffs who have suffered economic abuse. It 
also provides that the monetary relief component of a protection from abuse order does 
not limit the court's discretion to provide any other relief in a protection from abuse order, 
either as the statute specifically enumerates or as the court may find necessary and 
appropriate to issue as part of the proceeding under its discretion in section 4007, 
subsection 1, paragraph M, and does not preclude the plaintiff from seeking monetary 
relief through other actions as permissible by law.
