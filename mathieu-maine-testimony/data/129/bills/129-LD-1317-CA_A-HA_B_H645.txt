This amendment eliminates the General Fund appropriations that were in the bill. It also eliminates the bill's 
expansion of eligiblity for certain programs within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The 
DHHS is directed to implement administrative changes in compliance with current state law to ensure that, within 
existing resources, certain noncitizens are able to access certain assistance. Without additional funding, the impact of 
these new provisions on other programs and services in the DHHS cannot be determined at this time.
