34SUMMARY
35This bill provides a fee of $150 for surplus lines authority.  It authorizes the 
36Superintendent of Insurance to cancel the Maine license or authority of a nonresident 
37insurance licensee subject to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-A, chapter 16.  Such a 
Page 2 - 129LR2456(01)-11cancellation applies to a nonresident licensee only in the event that the licensee's license 
2authority in the licensee's home state is no longer active and the Maine license has been 
3granted on a reciprocal basis.  It removes language that prohibits an adjuster seeking to 
4provide adjusting services to an insured for a fee to be paid by the insured from soliciting 
5an adjustment services contract to any person for at least 36 hours after an accident or 
6occurrence as a result of which the person might have a potential claim.
