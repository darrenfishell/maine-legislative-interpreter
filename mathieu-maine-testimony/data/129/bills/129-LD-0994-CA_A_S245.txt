9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 284, L.D. 994, "Resolve, To Require 
10 the Approval by the Public Utilities Commission of a Proposal for a Long-term Contract 
11 for Deep-water Offshore Wind Energy" 
12 Amend the resolve by striking out everything after the title and inserting the 
13 following: 
14 'Preamble. Whereas, legislative power is defined by limitation, not by grant, and 
15 is absolute except as restricted by the Constitution of Maine; and 
16 Whereas, regulation of public utilities is a function of the Legislature, or a 
17 subordinate body, in the exercise of the police powers, as an attribute of sovereignty; and 
18 Whereas, the Legislature's delegation of authority to the Public Utilities 
19 Commission may be withdrawn, modified or superseded in whole or in part from time to 
20 time by the Legislature by specific legislative act or resolve exercising the Legislature's 
21 absolute authority; and 
22 Whereas, in 2010, the 124th Legislature enacted An Act To Implement the 
23 Recommendations of the Governor's Ocean Energy Task Force, Public Law 2009, 
24 chapter 615, finding that development of offshore wind energy projects in the Gulf of 
25 Maine is in the public interest; and 
26 Whereas, Public Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, section 6 directed the Public 
27 Utilities Commission to conduct a competitive solicitation for proposals for long-term 
28 contracts to supply installed capacity and associated renewable energy and renewable 
29 energy credits from one or more deep-water offshore wind energy or tidal energy 
30 demonstration projects and further directed the commission to make every effort to 
31 effectuate any such project; and

1 Whereas, on August 30, 2013, Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC submitted a 
2 responsive proposal to the Public Utilities Commission in response to the request for 
3 proposals; and 
4 Whereas, the Public Utilities Commission evaluated the Maine Aqua Ventus 
5 proposal and by orders issued February 13, 2014 and February 19, 2014 in Docket No. 
6 2010-00235 selected Maine Aqua Ventus as the seller to transfer to Central Maine Power 
7 Company transmission and distribution capacity and associated energy produced by its 
8 deep-water offshore wind energy pilot project, subject to certain terms and conditions, 
9 referred to as "the term sheet," set forth in the February 13, 2014 and February 19, 2014 
10 orders; and 
11 Whereas, in its February 19, 2014 order approving the term sheet, the Public 
12 Utilities Commission found that Maine Aqua Ventus had satisfied each of the 6 criteria 
13 enacted by the Legislature in Public Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, section 6, subsection 
14 1, paragraphs A to Fas prerequisites to ordering a transmission and distribution utility to 
15 enter into a long-term contract for the purchase of energy and capacity from Maine Aqua 
16 Ventus; and 
17 Whereas, consistent with the terms and conditions set forth by the Public Utilities 
18 Commission in its February 2014 orders, Maine Aqua Ventus and Central Maine Power 
19 Company negotiated and drafted a long-term contract for capacity and associated energy 
20 following a series of meetings involving Maine Aqua Ventus, Central Maine Power 
21 Company, the Office of the Public Advocate and commission staff and legal counsel and 
22 filed the final draft with the Public Utilities Commission in December 2017; and 
23 Whereas, in January 2018, the Public Utilities Commission delayed the contract's 
24 approval and solicited public comment on whether to reconsider the February 2014 orders 
25 approving the term sheet; and 
26 Whereas, on June 12, 2018, the Public Utilities Commission decided, despite 
27 objections from Maine Aqua Ventus and the great majority of public commenters, to not 
28 act on the long-term contract between Maine Aqua Ventus and Central Maine Power 
29 Company filed with the commission in December 2017 and by order issued August 6, 
30 2018 reopened the proceeding to reconsider the February 2014 orders; and 
31 Whereas, since 2010, scientists and energy experts in the State and around the 
32 world have increasingly concluded that offshore wind will make a major contribution to 
33 the expansion of essential renewable energy generation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels 
34 and greatly assisting in the transition to a reduced carbon future; and 
35 Whereas, since 2010, offshore wind energy development has rapidly accelerated in 
36 southern New England and other states on the Atlantic Coast, with fixed-bottom offshore 
3 7 wind energy projects contracting to deliver thousands of megawatts of power to regional 
38 electricity consumers and hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in projects and 
39 related onshore logistical and construction support; and 
40 Whereas, the finite locations available for siting fixed-bottom offshore wind energy 
41 projects in the State, the United States and much of the world limit such development, 
42 creating a clear need for and public interest in the prompt development of cost-effective 
43 floating offshore wind energy technology, especially for regions such as the Gulf of

Maine that lack the shallow water and sandy ocean floor necessary for fixed-bottom 
technologies; and 
Whereas, in 2019, floating offshore wind energy technology remains essential to the 
State to reach its carbon reduction goals in a cost-effective manner, to mitigate the 
destructive warming of the Gulf of Maine and to benefit the economy through becoming 
an international source of floating offshore wind energy technology and manufacturing; 
and 
Whereas, the Legislature finds that the public interest in prompt action by the State 
to determine the feasibility of the Maine Aqua Ventus floating offshore wind energy 
technology in the Gulf of Maine requires that the Legislature make certain findings and 
require the Public Utilities Commission to order execution of the December 2017 long­
term contract between Maine Aqua Ventus and Central Maine Power Company necessary 
to effectuate the deep-water offshore wind energy pilot project; and 
Whereas, the Legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the State to approve 
the December 2017 long-term contract between Maine Aqua Ventus and Central Maine 
Power Company as previously negotiated and drafted except with only such revisions as 
may be commercially necessary in light of the passage of time and the maturation of the 
offshore wind industry so that the deep-water offshore wind energy pilot project may 
move forward expeditiously and generate the benefits to the State and its people sought 
by the Legislature in Public Law 2009, chapter 615 and subsequent legislation; now, 
therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Findings. Resolved: That, notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
contrary or prior action or failure to act by the Public Utilities Commission, in order to 
best and most expeditiously effectuate the policies, goals and mandates set forth in the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3202, subsection 1 and Title 35-A, section 
3404, subsections 1 and 2; complete the competitive solicitation initiated by enactment of 
Public Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, section 6; and make every effort to effectuate the 
Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC floating deep-water offshore wind energy demonstration 
project, the Legislature: 
1. Finds that based on information filed by Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC, referred 
to in this resolve as "Maine Aqua Ventus," and others in the Public Utilities Commission 
Docket No. 2010-00235 and information otherwise in the public domain regarding the 
rapid worldwide development of offshore wind energy since 2010 and most recently 
offshore of the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New 
Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, including hundreds of millions of dollars of planned 
investment in onshore logistical support and construction, the Public Utilities 
Commission correctly concluded in its February 19, 2014 order that Maine Aqua Ventus, 
referred to in this subsection as "the supplier," had satisfied each of the 6 criteria enacted 
by the Legislature in Public Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, section 6, subsection 1, 
paragraphs A to F, as follows: 
A. "Supplier proposes sale of renewable energy produced by a deep-water offshore 
wind energy pilot project or a tidal energy demonstration project as defined in this 
RFP";

1 B. "Supplier has the technical and financial capacity to develop, construct, operate 
2 and, to the extent consistent with applicable federal law, decommission and remove 
3 the project in the manner provided by Title 38, section 480-HH, subsection 3, 
4 paragraph G"; 
5 C. "Supplier has quantified the tangible economic benefits of the project to the State, 
6 including those regarding goods and services to be purchased and use of local 
7 suppliers, contractors and other professionals, during the proposed term of the 
8 contract"; 
9 D. "Supplier has experience relevant to tidal power or the offshore wind energy 
10 industry, as applicable, including, in the case of a deep-water offshore wind energy 
11 pilot project proposal, experience relevant to the construction and operation of 
12 floating wind turbines, and has the potential to construct a deep-water offshore wind 
13 energy project 100 megawatts or greater in capacity in the future to provide electric 
14 consumers in Maine with project-generated power at reduced rates"; 
15 E. "Supplier has demonstrated a commitment to invest in manufacturing facilities in 
16 Maine that are related to deep-water offshore wind energy or tidal energy, as 
17 applicable, including, but not limited to, component, turbine, blade, foundation or 
18 maintenance facilities"; and 
19 F. "Supplier has taken advantage of all federal support for the project, including 
20 subsidies, tax incentives and grants, and incorporated those resources into its bid 
21 price"; 
22 2. Finds that the development and operation of Maine Aqua Ventus technology under 
23 the long-term contract will: 
24 A. Meet and surpass the substantial economic and professional opportunities and 
25 other societal benefits to the State anticipated by the Legislature in Public Law 2009, 
26 chapter 615 and subsequent legislation; 
27 B. Provide benefits to providers of supervisory control and data acquisition systems 
28 and other monitoring services, systems controls providers, marine and construction 
29 engineering fmns, marine transport services technology apprenticeship programs and 
30 other industries and service providers in the State; 
31 C. Promote the public interest in development of reasonably priced, high load factor, 
32 winter-peaking renewable energy at projected and stable rates to serve the State and 
33 the regional power grid; and 
34 D. Achieve several public purposes, including creating offshore-wind-related 
35 employment in the State, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing 
36 availability of renewable energy, mitigating the destructive warming of the Gulf of 
37 Maine and greatly assisting the State in achieving its carbon reduction goals; and 
38 3. Finds that the public interest requires that the State Government maintain 
39 consistent, transparent and predictable regulatory processes and that the State 
40 Government thus be known to the world to keep its word. 
41 Sec. 2. Maine Aqua Ventus to file draft contract with Public Utilities 
42 Commission. Resolved: That, within 15 days of the effective date of this resolve,
