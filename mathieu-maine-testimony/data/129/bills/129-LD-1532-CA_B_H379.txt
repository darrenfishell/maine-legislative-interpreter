SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment provides 
that the prohibitions and requirements in the bill, as amended, apply only in a 
participating municipality, which is a municipality that has approved at referendum an 
article subjecting the municipality to the prohibitions and requirements. The amendment 
requires a retail establishment in a participating municipality to charge at least a 5¢ fee 
for each reusable bag made of plastic and for each recycled paper bag used to bag 
products at the point of sale. It also clarifies provisions in the bill regarding the 
implementation of the statewide preemption on single-use carry-out bag regulation and 
the provision regarding violations of the bag prohibition and bag fees requirements. It 
makes additional technical changes to clarify the application of existing state law 
regarding plastic bags and removes language in the bill regarding the application of bag 
fees to purchasers using the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program or the 
Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental Food Program of the United States 
Child Nutrition Act of 1996.
