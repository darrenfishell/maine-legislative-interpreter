1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces the 
3 bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment authorizes the Department of Public 
4 Safety, Gambling Control Unit to regulate sports wagering in the State. 
5 Licensed commercial tracks, licensed off-track betting facilities, licensed casinos and 
6 federally recognized Indian tribes are eligible to apply for facility sports wagering 
7 licenses to conduct in-person sports wagering in the State. These entities are also eligible 
8 to apply for mobile sports wagering licenses to conduct sports wagering through mobile 
9 applications or digital platforms. Facility sports wagering licensees and mobile sports 
10 wagering licensees, referred to in the amendment as operators, may purchase or lease 
11 equipment, systems or services for sports wagering from entities with a supplier license, 
12 whose equipment, systems or services must meet standards established by rule. Operators 
13 may also enter into written contracts, approved by the director of the Gambling Control 
14 Unit within the Department of Public Safety, with management services licensees that 
15 have sufficient knowledge and experience in the business of operating sports wagering to 
16 effectively conduct sports wagering on behalf of operators. A person employed by a 
17 facility sports wagering licensee to be engaged directly in sports wagering-related 
18 activities must be licensed by the Gambling Control Unit. 
19 Operators may accept wagers on professional, collegiate and amateur sports events, 
20 including international events, as well as on the individual performances of athletes, on 
21 motor vehicle races and on electronic sports. Sports wagers are prohibited on high school 
22 events, other events where a majority of participants are less than 18 years of age and 
23 events involving Maine-based colleges and universities. Operators may not accept sports 
24 wagers from individuals under 21 years of age; participants in the sports event, including 
25 athletes and officials; persons with an interest in the outcome of the sports event 
26 identified by the director by rule; the operator's own directors or employees or persons 
27 living in their households; persons voluntarily or involuntarily placed on a list maintained 
28 by the Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety of persons not 
29 authorized to make sports wagers; 3rd persons making wagers on behalf of another 
30 person; and Gambling Control Unit employees. Mobile sports wagering licensees are 
31 also prohibited from accepting sports wagers from persons who are not physically located 
32 within the State. 
33 A facility sports wagering licensee must remit 10% of the licensee's adjusted gross 
34 sports wagering receipts to the State and a mobile sports wagering licensee must remit 
35 16% of the licensee's adjusted gross sports wagering receipts to the State. One percent of 
36 adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the General Fund for the 
37 administrative expenses of the Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public 
38 Safety and 1 % of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the 
39 Gambling Addiction Prevention and Treatment Fund established by the Maine Revised 
40 Statutes, Title 5, section 20006-B. The remaining adjusted gross sports wagering receipts 
41 remitted to the State must be deposited in the General Fund.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill authorizes the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of Public Safety, to regulate sports 
wagering in the State and directs that 10% of gross sports wagering facility revenue and 16% of gross sports wagering 
mobile revenue be credited to the General Fund, 1 % be credited to the GCU for administrative expenses and 1 % be 
credited to the Gambling Addiction and Prevention Treatment Fund. Facility and mobile operators will retain the 
remainder of the gross. General fund revenue of $1,311,00 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $2,622,000 in fiscal year 2020-
21 and Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $95,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $190,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 is 
estimated to be generated from sports wagering. The estimate prorates assumptions contained in the May 2017, 
Oxford Economics' "Economic Impact of Legalized Sports Betting" report, using the criteria of moderate availability 
for in-person sports wagering and convenient availability for mobile wagering. 
LR0069(03) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $122,258 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $127,576 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 for one Public Safety Manager II position and associated All Other costs. The bill creates facility sports 
wagering licenses, mobile sports wagering licenses, supplier licenses, management services licenses and employee 
occupational licenses. License fees are estimated to generate Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $470,250 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $3,250 in fiscal year 2020-21. License fee revenue assumes that two casinos and one 
commercial racetrack will have both facility and mobile sports betting, four off-track betting facilities will have 
facility betting only, one off-track betting facility will have a facility license and a mobile license and two Indian 
tribes will only seek mobile licenses. This estimate also assumes that six online vendors will pursue either a supplier 
or management license through a partnership with an existing entity to access the Maine gaming market. 
This bill also includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$95,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $190,000 in fiscal year 2020-21 to allow expenditure of sports betting revenue. 
Additional costs to the Department of Public Safety associated with performing criminal history background checks 
can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
