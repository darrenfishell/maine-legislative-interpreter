Page 1 - 129LR0618(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง10110, sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 414, ยง2, is 
3further amended to read:
42.  Programs.  The trust shall develop and implement conservation programs to help 
5reduce energy costs for electricity consumers in the State by the maximum amount 
6possible.  The trust shall establish and, on a schedule determined by the trust, revise 
7objectives and an overall energy strategy for conservation programs.  Conservation 
8programs implemented by the trust must be consistent with the objectives and an overall 
9energy strategy developed by the trust and approved by the commission and be cost-
10effective, as defined by the board by rule.  In defining "cost-effective," the board may 
11consider the extent to which a program promotes sustainable economic development or 
12reduces environmental damage to the extent the board can quantify or otherwise 
13reasonably identify such effects.  Consistent with the other requirements of this section, 
14the trust, in adopting and implementing conservation programs, shall seek to encourage 
15efficiency in electricity use, provide incentives for the development of new, energy-
16efficient business activity in the State and take into account the costs and benefits of 
17energy efficiency and conservation to existing business activity in the State.  The trust 
18shall ensure that conservation programs for residential consumers provide support for 
19energy efficiency or conservation measures in new homes as well as in retrofits or 
20improvements of existing homes.
21A.  The trust shall consider, without limitation, conservation programs that:
22(1)  Increase consumer awareness of cost-effective options for conserving energy;
23(2)  Create more favorable market conditions for the increased use of energy-
24efficient products and services;
25(3)  Promote sustainable economic development and reduce environmental 
26damage; 
27(4)  Reduce the price of electricity over time for all consumers by achieving 
28reductions in demand for electricity during peak use periods; and
29(5)  Reduce total energy costs for electricity consumers in the State by increasing 
30the efficiency with which electricity is consumed.
31B.  The trust, with regard to funds available to the trust under this section, shall:
32(1)  Target at least 10% of funds for electricity conservation collected under 
33former subsection 4 or subsection 4-A or $2,600,000, whichever is greater, to 
34programs for low-income residential consumers, as defined by the board by rule;
35(2)  Target at least 10% of funds for electricity conservation collected under 
36former subsection 4 or subsection 4-A or $2,600,000, whichever is greater, to 
37programs for small business consumers, as defined by the board by rule; and
38(3)  To the greatest extent practicable, apportion remaining funds among 
39customer groups and geographic areas in a manner that allows all other customers 
40to have a reasonable opportunity to participate in one or more conservation 
41programs.
Page 2 - 129LR0618(01)-11C.  The trust shall hold at least one public hearing and invite, accept, review and 
2consider comments and suggestions from interested parties prior to adopting or 
3substantially revising conservation programs or the objectives and overall strategy for 
4conservation programs.
5D.  The trust shall monitor conservation planning and program development activities 
6in the region and around the country.
7E.  The trust shall implement conservation programs by contracting with service 
8providers in accordance with subsection 3.
9F.  The trust shall monitor and evaluate the delivery of conservation programs by 
10service providers and assess the cost-effectiveness of programs in meeting the 
11objectives and overall strategy established by the trust.
12G.  The trust, to the extent possible, shall coordinate its efforts with other agencies of 
13the State with energy-related responsibilities.
14H.  The trust shall secure sufficient technical and administrative expertise to carry out 
15its responsibilities pursuant to this section by:
16(1)  Contracting with appropriate entities with relevant expertise and experience;
17(2)  Establishing one or more advisory groups composed of persons with relevant 
18expertise and experience; or
19(3)  Any other reasonable means developed by the trust.
20I.  The trust may coordinate its efforts under this section with similar efforts in other 
21states in the northeast region and enter into agreements with public agencies or other 
22entities in or outside of the State for joint or cooperative conservation planning or 
23conservation program delivery, if the trust finds that such coordination or agreements 
24would provide demonstrable benefits to citizens of the State and be consistent with 
25this section, the conservation programs and the objectives and overall strategy for the 
26conservation programs.
27J.  The trust shall encourage school facility managers to complete an energy 
28efficiency training and certification program established and conducted by the trust 
29under this section.  To the extent the trust determines necessary and appropriate to 
30meet the goals of this paragraph, the trust may, in accordance with the requirements 
31of this section, establish incentive mechanisms to encourage participation in this 
32program.  For purposes of this paragraph, "school facility managers" means persons 
33employed by school administrative units in this State who are responsible for the 
34design or operation of school administrative unit facilities or the heating, ventilation 
35or air conditioning systems or equipment used in such facilities.
36K.  The trust shall provide programs developed in partnership with energy providers, 
37such as transmission and distribution utilities, to provide consumers with information 
38on energy options to promote energy efficiency and increased use of alternative 
39energy resources in the State.
40L.  Pursuant to section 3214, subsection 2-A, the trust shall work with investor-
41owned transmission and distribution utilities, consumer-owned transmission and 
42distribution utilities that elect to participate in an arrearage management program 
Page 3 - 129LR0618(01)-11pursuant to section 3214, subsection 2-A and other stakeholders to provide access to 
2a complementary low-income energy efficiency program for participants in the 
3arrearage management programs in order to help reduce participants' energy 
4consumption.
5This paragraph is repealed September 30, 2021.
6SUMMARY
7This bill provides that the Efficiency Maine Trust must ensure that conservation 
8programs for residential consumers provide support for energy efficiency or conservation 
9measures in new homes not just in retrofits or improvements of existing homes.
