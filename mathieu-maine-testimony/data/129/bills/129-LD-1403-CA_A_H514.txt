30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the section 
32 of the bill relating to presumptive eligibility. It also grants 100% reimbursement for 
33 general assistance costs to Indian tribes. It clarifies that the municipality's most recent 
34 state valuation rather than the all state valuation is used for calculating when a 
35 municipality begins to be reimbursed 90% for general assistance costs and that the 
36 reimbursement is for gross costs rather than net costs. It establishes that the new 
37 departmental reimbursement to municipalities begins July 1, 2020.
