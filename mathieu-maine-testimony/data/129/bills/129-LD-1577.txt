Page 1 - 129LR1116(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §333, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 648, §2, is further 
3amended to read:
41.  Procedures.  A nursing facility that voluntarily reduces the number of its licensed 
5beds at any time prior to July 1, 2007, for any reason except to create private rooms may 
6convert the beds back and thereby increase the number of nursing facility beds to no more 
7than the previously licensed number of nursing facility beds, after obtaining a certificate 
8of need in accordance with this section, as long as the nursing facility has been in 
9continuous operation without material change of ownership.  For purposes of this section 
10and sections 333-A and 334-A, beds voluntarily removed from service prior to July 1, 
112007 and available to be reinstated under this section are referred to as "reserved beds."  
12Reserved beds remain facility property until they lapse as provided for in this section or 
13are transferred.  To reinstate reserved beds under this subsection, the nursing facility must 
14shall:
15A.  Give notice of the number of beds it is reserving no later than 30 days after the 
16effective date of the license reduction; 
17A-1.  Annually provide notice to the department no later than July 1st of each year of 
18the nursing facility's intent to retain these reserved beds, subject to the limitations set 
19forth in subsection 2, paragraph B.  Notice provided under this paragraph preserves 
20the reserved beds through June 30th of the following year.  The annual notice on 
21reserved beds may be filed by an individual nursing facility or by multiple nursing 
22facilities through a membership organization approved by the department by a single 
23filing; and
24B.  Obtain a certificate of need to convert beds back under section 335, except that, if 
25no construction is required for the conversion of beds back, the application must be 
26processed in accordance with subsection 2.  The department in its review shall 
27evaluate the impact that the nursing facility beds to be converted back would have on 
28those existing nursing facility beds and facilities within 30 miles of the applicant's 
29facility and shall determine whether to approve the request based on current 
30certificate of need criteria and methodology.
31Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §333, sub-§2, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 664, §2, is 
32amended to read:
33A.  Review of applications that meet the requirements of this section must be based 
34on the requirements of section 335, subsection 7, except that the determinations 
35required by section 335, subsection 7, paragraph B must be based on the historical 
36costs of operating the beds and must consider whether the projected costs are 
37consistent with the costs of the beds prior to closure, adjusted for inflation 
38applications that seek to reopen reserved beds must be approved if the projected 
39incremental costs of reopening and operating the reserved beds are consistent with 
40the facility's costs of operating its other beds.  Applicants are not required to 
41demonstrate that any increases in MaineCare costs are offset by other MaineCare 
42savings.  The costs of ongoing operation of both the reopened beds and the 
43complement of facility beds at the time the reserved beds are reopened must be 
Page 2 - 129LR1116(01)-11recognized as allowable costs and incorporated into the facility's MaineCare payment 
2rates; and
3Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §1720, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 242, §1, is amended to read:

7medical director in a base year amount not to exceed $10,000, with that amount being 
8subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment.
9Sec. 4.  Cost of computer and cloud-based software systems a fixed cost.  
10Beginning October 1, 2019, the cost incurred by a nursing facility for the acquisition, 
11including set-up costs, use and maintenance, of computer or cloud-based software 
12systems must be included as a fixed cost by the Department of Health and Human

20December 15, 2019 to provide reimbursement for up to 30 bed hold days per calendar 
21year when the resident is absent from the facility.
22Sec. 6.  Cost of health insurance a fixed cost.  The Department of Health and 
23Human Services shall amend its rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter 
24III, Section 67, Principles of Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities no later than 
25December 15, 2019 to include the cost of health insurance for employees attributable to

35SUMMARY
36This bill restores the ability of nursing facilities to voluntarily reduce the number of 
37their licensed beds and then later increase the number of their licensed beds to the prior 
38level after obtaining a certificate of need and meeting certain conditions.
Page 3 - 129LR1116(01)-11The bill modifies the process to obtain certificate of need approval to reopen reserved 
2beds.  Applications that seek to reopen reserved beds must be approved if the projected 
3incremental costs of reopening and operating the reopened beds are consistent with the 
4facility's costs of operating its other beds.  Applicants are not required to demonstrate that 
5any increases in MaineCare costs are offset by other MaineCare savings.  The costs of 
6ongoing operation of both the restored beds and the complement of facility beds at the 
7time the reserved beds are reopened must be recognized as allowable costs and 
8incorporated into the facility's MaineCare payment rates.
9The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to include in its 
10calculation of reimbursement for services provided by a nursing facility the cost incurred 
11by the facility for a medical director.
12The bill requires the cost incurred by a nursing facility for the acquisition, use and 
13maintenance of computer or cloud-based software systems to be included as a fixed cost.
14The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules 
15governing adult family care services to provide reimbursement for up to 30 bed hold days 
16per calendar year when a resident is absent from a facility.
17The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules 
18governing principles of reimbursement for nursing facilities to include the cost of health 
19insurance for employees attributable to MaineCare residents as a fixed cost.  It also 
20requires the department to amend these rules to include reimbursement for 50% of a 
21nursing facility's charges for a maximum of 6 months for a newly admitted resident who 
22is determined to be financially ineligible for MaineCare after the resident is admitted to 
23the nursing facility and the charges remain unpaid after reasonable efforts are made by 
24the nursing facility to collect the debt based on these charges.
