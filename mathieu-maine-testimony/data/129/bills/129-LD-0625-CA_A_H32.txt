Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill phases out the insurance premium tax on annuity considerations over a 10 year period with the tax eliminated 
in year 10 and thereafter. This would result in a loss of General Fund revenue of $270,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and 
$800,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. When fully phased out the loss of General Fund revenue will have grown to 
$5,600,000 annually. The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation to the Department of Administrative 
and Financial Services of $33,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 for computer programming costs.
