COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "4,, to H.P. 858, L.D. 1184, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Penalties for Early Retirement for Certain Members of the Maine Public 
Employees Retirement System" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. Reduction in early retirement penalty for certain state employees 
and teachers. Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 17852, 
subsection 3-A or any other provision of law to the contrary, beginning October 1, 2019 
the reduction in the retirement benefit for a qualified member is 2.25% for each year that 
the qualified member's age precedes 62 years of age at retirement. 
As used in this section, "qualified member" means a member of the Maine Public 
Employees Retirement System who: 
1. Retired from service as a state employee between July 1, 2011 and January 1, 
2012 or as a teacher between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2012; 
2. Had completed 25 or more years of creditable service upon retirement; 
3. Had neither 10 years of creditable service nor had reached 60 years of age with 
one year of creditable service immediately before July 1, 1993; and 
4. Had not attained 62 years of age as of retirement from service as a state employee 
or teacher. 
As used in this section, the terms "creditable service," "employee," "member," 
"retirement," "retirement benefit," "state employee" and 11teacher11 have the same meaning 
as in Title 5, section 17001. 
Sec. 2. Appropriations and allocations. The following appropriations and 
allocations are made.
