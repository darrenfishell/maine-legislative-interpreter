Page 1 - 129LR1411(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §571, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 782, is amended to read:
3§571.  Legislative findings and purpose
4The Legislature finds and declares, as have courts in this State, that the intertidal 
5lands of the State are impressed with a public trust and that the State is responsible for 
6protection of the public's interest in this land have unique public value.  Historic uses 
7such as fishing, fowling and navigation remain, to varying degrees, important today, 
8depending on the location and character of particular stretches of intertidal land, the ease 
9of access to such land and the proximity to population centers.  Other historic uses such 
10as lateral passage of individuals, carts and wagons, the movement and grazing of 
11livestock and the cutting of salt marsh grasses are little used today.  Still other historic 
12uses such as the building of seawalls, jetties and groins, the parking and racing of motor 
13vehicles, the storage of small boats and fishing gear and the removal of sand, gravel and 
14other materials are often prohibited altogether or closely regulated today.
15The Legislature further finds and declares that this public trust is part of the common 
16law of Maine and generally derived from the practices, conditions and needs in Maine, 
17from English Common Law and from the Massachusetts Colonial Ordinance of 1641-47.  
18The public trust is an evolving doctrine reflective of the customs, traditions, heritage and 
19habits of the Maine people.  In Maine, the doctrine has diverged from the laws of England 
20and Massachusetts. The public trust encompasses those uses of intertidal land essential to 
21the health and welfare of the Maine people, which uses include, but are not limited to, 
22fishing, fowling, navigation, use as a footway between points along the shore and use for 
23recreational purposes. These recreational uses are among the most important to the Maine 
24people today who use intertidal land for relaxation from the pressures of modern society 
25and for enjoyment of nature's beauty in the 21st century public uses of intertidal land, 
26while not excluding most historic uses, cannot be limited to these uses; these uses cannot 
27be seen as fixed or static.  Like all legislative and common law principles, public uses of 
28intertidal land must evolve with changed conditions and today extend to a wide range of 
29recreational and commercial uses, many of which could not even be imagined when 
30Maine became a state, much less when the Massachusetts Colonial Ordinance of 1641-47 
31was adopted.
32The Legislature further finds and declares that the protection of the public uses 
33referred to in this chapter is of great public interest and grave concern to the State these 
34evolving public uses of intertidal land confer both economic and general welfare benefits 
35on the citizens of this State and that mechanisms exist by which these evolving uses and 
36benefits can be made secure and regulated as necessary.  Whether the State is seen to be 
37acting to discharge its public trust duties with respect to state-owned intertidal land or 
38exercising the State’s police power, a power that applies to both publicly held and 
39privately held property interests, is a matter of indifference.
40Sec. 2.  12 MRSA §572, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 782, is repealed and the 
41following enacted in its place:
Page 2 - 129LR1411(01)-11§572.  Definitions
2As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
3have the following meanings.
41.  Intertidal land.  "Intertidal land" means land intermittently flooded by action of 
5the tides, lying between the mean high tide line and the mean low tide line or land 
6extending 100 rods seaward from the mean high tide line, whichever is the shorter 
7distance.
82.  Submerged land.  "Submerged land" means land lying 100 rods from the mean 
9high tide line or land lying seaward of the mean low tide line if the mean low tide line is 
10less than 100 rods from the mean high tide line.  "Submerged land" is land that is seldom 
11exposed by action of the tides.
12Sec. 3.  12 MRSA §573, as enacted by PL 1985, c. 782, is repealed.
13Sec. 4.  12 MRSA §§574 to 576 are enacted to read:
14§574.  Permitted public use rights on intertidal land and submerged land
151.  Historic uses.  Any of the historic uses of intertidal land under section 571 are 
16permitted, except those expressly prohibited by statute or rule adopted by a state agency 
17charged with oversight of intertidal land.  Permitted historic uses are subject to rules 
18adopted by a state agency charged with protecting the public health, safety and general 
19welfare.
202.  Recreational uses.  Unless expressly prohibited by statute or rule adopted by a 
21state agency charged with oversight of intertidal land, water-related recreational uses of 
22intertidal land, including, but not limited to, playing in the water, swimming, snorkeling 
23and using skim, surf and paddle boards, are permitted.  Additionally, on exposed sand 
24areas of intertidal land, permitted recreational uses include, but are not limited to, sitting, 
25walking, running, reading, sunbathing, picnicking, the throwing of balls and other toys, 
26gathering shells and sea glass and the building of sandcastles.  All recreational uses are 
27subject to laws or rules adopted by the Legislature or a state agency charged with 
28protecting the public health, safety and general welfare.
293.  Commercial uses.  Unless expressly prohibited by statute or rule adopted by a 
30state agency charged with oversight of intertidal land, commercial uses of intertidal land, 
31including, but not limited to, seaweed harvesting; aquaculture of fish, shellfish or other 
32marine organisms; the extension from the mainland of utility cables and pipelines to 
33service island communities and permitted offshore facilities; and the storage, rental and 
34sale of paddle boards and surf boards, kayaks, small boats and related marine equipment, 
35are permitted.  All commercial uses are subject to licensing and use laws enacted by the 
36Legislature and rules adopted by a state agency charged with protecting the public health, 
37safety and general welfare.
384.  Submerged land uses.  Permitted historic, recreational and commercial uses of 
39intertidal land that extend into submerged land areas and overlying waters are not 
Page 3 - 129LR1411(01)-11prohibited by this fact alone, insofar as the uses do not interfere with public or private 
2uses and activities permitted on submerged land.
3§575.  Limitation on public use rights on intertidal land and submerged land
4The public use rights under section 574 do not allow any individual to:
51.  Gather and remove.  Gather and remove in bulk from intertidal land or 
6submerged land without a valid license sand, soil, rocks, minerals, seaweed or living 
7marine organisms;
82.  Structure or improvement.  Interfere with or trespass on any structure or 
9improvement erected or maintained on intertidal land or submerged land in accordance 
10with state law;
113.  Refuse or waste materials.  Deposit or leave any refuse or waste materials on 
12intertidal land or submerged land or in overlying waters;
134.  Private property.  Trespass on private property that is above the mean high tide 
14line;
155.  Access to intertidal land.  Gain access to intertidal land by any means other than 
16by a public way, right-of-way or easement that terminates at the mean high tide line or by 
17water, such as by kayak, canoe, motorized watercraft, paddle board or swimming; or
186.  Motorized vehicle.  Operate or park any motorized vehicle on intertidal land 
19except to perform emergency or rescue service.
20§576.  Miscellaneous provisions
211.  State powers.  The State may seek by gift or purchase to increase points of access 
22to intertidal land.  The State may provide or increase parking spaces, toilet facilities, 
23lifeguard services and other amenities to facilitate public use of intertidal land.  The 
24Legislature and state agencies may set safety standards for various uses and reasonable 
25hours of operation for intertidal land generally and beach areas in particular and settle 
26conflicts that arise between competing intertidal land users.
272.  Municipal powers.  Municipalities may seek by gift or purchase to increase 
28points of access to intertidal land.  Municipalities within which intertidal land is located 
29may provide or increase parking spaces, toilet facilities, lifeguard services and other 
30amenities to facilitate public use of intertidal land.  Municipalities may exercise their 
31police powers to adopt ordinances to prevent and resolve disturbances on and set 
32reasonable hours of operation for intertidal land generally and beach areas in particular.  
33Municipal ordinances may not override or conflict with intertidal land use laws enacted 
34by the Legislature or rules adopted by a state agency charged with protecting the public 
35health, safety and general welfare.  Municipalities may not prohibit intertidal land uses 
36under section 574.
37Sec. 5.  Maine Revised Statutes headnote amended; revision clause.  In the 
38Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, chapter 202-A, in the chapter headnote, the words "the 
Page 4 - 129LR1411(01)-11public trust in intertidal land" are amended to read "the intertidal land expanded use rights 
2act" and the Revisor of Statutes shall implement this revision when updating, publishing 
3or republishing the statutes.
4SUMMARY
5This bill addresses public uses of intertidal land by substantially amending the 
6existing laws on intertidal land.  It revises the headnote of the chapter to reflect the 
7recognition of expanded uses of intertidal land.
8The bill replaces most of the legislative findings and purpose language to recite 
9historic uses and note that the evolving public uses of intertidal land confer both 
10economic and general welfare benefits to the citizens of this State.  It specifies that there 
11is no difference in whether the State is acting to discharge its public trust duties with 
12respect to intertidal land or exercising its police power to protect the public health, safety 
13and general welfare.
14The bill defines "intertidal land," which is consistent with the definition in statute, 
15and "submerged land."
16The bill delineates permitted uses of intertidal land, identifying historic, recreational 
17and commercial uses.  All are subject to state laws and rules, and commercial uses may 
18be subject to licensing, as well.
19The bill also limits some activities on intertidal land.
20The bill recognizes the power of the State and municipal police powers that may be 
21used to improve and facilitate uses of intertidal land.
