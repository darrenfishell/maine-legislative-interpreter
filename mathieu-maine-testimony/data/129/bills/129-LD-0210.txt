2CONCEPT DRAFT
3SUMMARY
4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5This bill proposes to enact measures to enhance technology and engineering 
6education for students in grades 7 to 12.  The measures include, but are not limited to:
71.  Changing the industrial arts/technology teacher endorsement to a technology and 
8engineering endorsement and amending the endorsement requirements.  The amended 
9endorsement requirements would grandfather all current teachers who hold an industrial 
10arts/technology endorsement and make them technology and engineering teachers.  The 
11amended endorsement requirements would also allow a college graduate with an 
12engineering degree to obtain a technology and engineering endorsement; and
132.  Creating 3 categories of science endorsements: life science, physical science and 
14technology and engineering.
