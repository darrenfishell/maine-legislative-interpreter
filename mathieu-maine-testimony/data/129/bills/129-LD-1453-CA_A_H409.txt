The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $2,077,596 in 
fiscal year 2019-20 and $6,458,383 in fiscal year 2020-21 for the state share of the net costs of providing access to 
comprehensive medically necessary preventive, diagnostic and restorative dental services for MaineCare eligible 
adults 21 years of age and older. This assumes 70,128 MaineCare eligible adults (37.4% of those eligible) would use 
this service annually at a cost of$436.36 per person. Offsetting against these costs are assumed savings in the 
MaineCare emergency services and the current adult dental services provided outside of the emergency room used 
annually by this population. The bill's additional spending is assumed to be fully phased in during the biennium while 
offsetting savings are assumed to phase-in over a longer period of time. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are 
also included for the FMAP match.
