Page 1 - 129LR1195(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §4352, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. G, §1, is 
3further amended to read:
44.  Exemptions.  Real estate used or to be used by a public utility, as defined in Title 
535-A, section 102, subsection 13, by a person who is issued a certificate by the Public 
6Utilities Commission under Title 35-A, section 122 or by a renewable ocean energy 
7project as defined in Title 12, section 1862, subsection 1, paragraph F-1 is wholly or 
8partially exempt from an ordinance only when on petition, notice and public hearing the 
9Public Utilities Commission determines that the exemption is reasonably necessary for 
10public welfare and convenience.  The exemptions provided in this subsection do not 
11apply to elective transmission upgrades.  The Public Utilities Commission shall adopt by 
12rule procedures to implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection 
13are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  For 
14purposes of this subsection, "elective transmission upgrade" means a proposed 
15transmission line for which a person developing the transmission line has agreed to pay 
16all of the costs of the transmission line without passing those costs on to the ratepayers.
17Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3136, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2007, c. 148, §12, is 
18repealed and the following enacted in its place:
191.  Prior approval needed to take land for location of transmission lines carrying 
205,000 volts or more.  A transmission and distribution utility may take and hold by right 
21of eminent domain lands and easements necessary for the proper location of its 
22transmission lines that are designed to carry voltages of 5,000 volts or more and of 
23necessary appurtenances, located within the territory in which the utility is authorized to 
24do public utility business, only if the public utility:
25A.  Obtains the prior approval of the body of government having jurisdiction over the 
26territory in which the land or easement is located;
27B.  Obtains the approval of the commission pursuant to subsection 4; and
28C.  Takes the land or easement in the same manner and under the same conditions as 
29set forth in chapter 65.
30Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3136, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2007, c. 148, §13, is 
31further amended to read:
323.  Prior right to locate distribution lines and appurtenances in right-of-way 
33limits of public way.  Subject to prior approval of the body of government having 
34jurisdiction over the territory in which the land or easement is located and approval by the 
35commission under subsection 4, transmission and distribution utilities may take and hold 
36by right of eminent domain land or easements necessary for the proper location of their 
37distribution lines and the necessary appurtenances, but only where the transmission and 
38distribution utilities had a prior right to locate their distribution lines and necessary 
39appurtenances in the right-of-way limits of a public way and the body having jurisdiction 
40over the public way has caused the utility to remove its distribution lines and appurtenant 
Page 2 - 129LR1195(01)-11structures outside the right-of-way limits of the public way.  This right does not apply to 
2lands or easements as specified in subsection 2, paragraphs B, C, D and E.
3Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3136, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2007, c. 148, §14, is 
4further amended to read:
54.  Commission approval required; certificate of public convenience and 
6necessity; environmental factors.  A location to be taken by eminent domain for such 
7transmission or distribution lines must be approved first by the body of government 
8having jurisdiction over the territory in which the land or easement is located and then by 
9the commission before a transmission and distribution utility can exercise the right of 
10eminent domain granted in subsection 1 or subsection 3. The commission may not 
11approve a location to be taken by eminent domain for the construction, rebuilding or 
12relocation of a transmission line that requires a certificate of public convenience and 
13necessity under section 3132, unless the commission has issued a certificate of public 
14convenience and necessity for that transmission line.  Environmental factors to be 
15considered for proper location of a transmission line are not subject to review by the 
16commission under this section when the location of the transmission line has received site 
17location of development approval under Title 38, section 484.
18SUMMARY
19This bill requires a transmission and distribution utility, prior to taking land or an 
20easement by eminent domain, to obtain the approval of the body of government having 
21jurisdiction over the land or easement.  Following approval by the body of government, 
22the transmission and distribution utility is still required to obtain a certificate of public 
23convenience and necessity from the Public Utilities Commission.
24The bill makes explicit that the exemption from municipal zoning ordinances 
25regarding real estate used by public utilities does not apply to an elective transmission 
26upgrade, which is a transmission line for which a person developing the transmission line 
27has agreed to pay all of the costs of developing the transmission line without passing 
28those costs on to ratepayers.
