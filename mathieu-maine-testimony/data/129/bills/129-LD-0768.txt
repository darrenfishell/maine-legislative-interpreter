4in the nation cannot be combated at the individual or household level, and that public

7will have the most impact on bridging the wealth and wage gap between historically 
8disadvantaged racial and ethnic populations and the rest of the citizens in the State; and
9Whereas, this legislation establishes the Commission To Research the Economic 
10Disparities of Racial and Ethnic Populations; and

12the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
13legislative session; and
