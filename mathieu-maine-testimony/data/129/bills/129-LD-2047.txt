32liquidated debt greater than $25, referred to in this section as "the creditor agency," may 
33notify the State Tax Assessor in writing of the identity of the person and the amount of 
34the debt.  The assessor shall then set aside, to the extent of that debt, any refund to which 
35the person is entitled under this Title.  A liquidated child support debt that the Department 
36of Health and Human Services has contracted to collect, pursuant to Title 19-A, section 
372103 or 2301, subsection 2, is eligible for setoff pursuant to this section.

3Procedure Act and is limited to the issues of whether the person whose debt was set off is 
4the same person who is indebted to the creditor agency, whether the debt became 
5liquidated and whether any post-liquidation event has affected the liability.

7assessor shall transfer the set-off refund amount to the creditor agency.  The assessor 
8shall provide the creditor agency with information sufficient to identify each person 
9whose refund is set off pursuant to this section.  If the person is an individual, the 
10information must include the individual's name, last known address and social security 
11number.

13timely request for hearing under subsection 2 or a hearing is held before the creditor 
14agency and a liquidated debt is determined to be due to that agency, the setoff is final 
15except as determined by further appeal.  The creditor agency shall release to the person

17agency within 90 days of the determination or as otherwise provided by the agency in an 
18adopted rule.

20section as to the existence of a liquidated debt constitutes final agency action appealable 
21under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.

23refund has been set off with the full amount transferred to the agency by the assessor 
24pursuant to this section.

26the assessor with respect to one person, the assessor shall set off against the refund due 
27that person as many claims of the agencies as possible in the following order of priority:
28A.  Liquidated child support debts owed to the Department of Health and Human 
29Services;
30B.  Court-ordered restitution obligations;
31C.  Fines and fees owed to any of the courts; and
32D.  All other claims in the order of their receipt by the assessor.
338.  Disclosure of information.  In any civil or criminal action in which a fine, order 
34to pay or money judgment is entered in favor of the State or any agency or department of 
35the State, or in any action in which counsel is assigned for an indigent party, the court 
36may require the person so indebted to the State, agency or department, or the party for 
37whom counsel has been assigned, to provide financial information under oath and on such 
38forms as may be prepared by the Judicial Department, together with any other 
39information reasonably related to fulfilling the purposes of this section.  In the case of an 
40individual debtor, the required information may include the individual's social security 
41number.  The Judicial Department may disclose social security numbers and financial 
Page 7 - 129LR2992(01)-11information obtained in accordance with this subsection to agencies or departments of the 
2State and to private collection agencies working under contract for the State for the 
3purpose of collection of the amounts owed.  A person who has access to or receives social 
4security numbers or other financial information under this subsection shall maintain the 
5confidentiality of the information and use it only for the purposes for which it was 
6disclosed.

12Part A authorizes the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Maine 
13Revenue Services to disclose certain confidential tax information to the Department of 
14Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance as necessary to administer 
15Maine's insurance taxes and the credit for disability income protection plans in the 
16workplace.
17Part B clarifies that "eligible business equipment" under the business equipment tax 
18exemption program does not include property to the extent it is eligible for exemption 
19from property tax under any other provision of law and "qualified property" does not 
20include any vehicle on which a tax assessed pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
2136, chapter 111 has been paid.
22Part C allows a married taxpayer to claim a personal exemption deduction for that 
23taxpayer's spouse when not filing a joint return, as long as the spouse has no gross income 
24during the taxable year and, notwithstanding the temporary suspension of the federal 
25personal exemption deduction through 2025, a personal exemption deduction may 
26otherwise be claimed for the spouse for federal income tax purposes.  This change applies 
27to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020.  It also amends the real estate 
28withholding law, excepting buyers of real estate from the withholding requirement if the 
29consideration paid for the property is less than $100,000.  This increased threshold is 
30effective for sales occurring on or after January 1, 2021.

32liquidated debt owed to another agency of the State.  Under current law, only income tax 
33refunds may be set off.  Part D also corrects cross-references.

35Development must provide information under the Brunswick Naval Air Station job

38necessary to determine the job tax increment under the program.  It also establishes a 
39requirement that businesses located in the base area report to the department by April 
Page 21 - 129LR2992(01)-1115th of each year the number of employees employed at the base area during the 
2immediately preceding calendar year, the state income taxes withheld for each of those 
3employees and any other information as may be reasonably required by the department

5Assessor issue a Pine Tree Development Zone benefits report annually on October 1st.

7Increment Financing Program must report required information to the Department of

10department must provide information to the State Tax Assessor necessary for making 
11determinations of eligibility for reimbursement under the program.
12Part F reduces from 60 days to 15 days the time that a taxpayer with a final tax 
13liability exceeding $1,000 has to cooperate with Maine Revenue Services in a plan for 
14liquidating the tax liability before the State Tax Assessor may notify certain licensing 
15authorities of the taxpayer's lack of cooperation, thereby beginning the license revocation 
16process.

22711-A, in order to require the filing of real estate transfer tax returns with the State Tax 
23Assessor and the payment of the tax to the State Tax Assessor instead of to the register of 
24deeds for the county in which the real estate being transferred is located.  It requires the 
25register of deeds to verify with the State Tax Assessor that the tax liability imposed on the 
26transfer of real property is satisfied before recording the deed transferring the real estate.  
27It directs the State Tax Assessor to prescribe real estate transfer tax returns, removes the 
28statutory requirements to include signatures and taxpayer identification numbers on those 
29forms and clarifies that the value of the real estate transferred must be on the declaration 
30of value.
31Part H also provides that the State Tax Assessor is required to develop the computer 
32systems infrastructure necessary to implement the changes made by this Part within 4 
33years; the changes made by this Part do not take effect until 90 days after the assessor
