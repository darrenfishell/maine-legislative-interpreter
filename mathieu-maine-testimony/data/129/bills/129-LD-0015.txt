22hours of an employee who has declined to work on Sundays, it is prima facie

25employee would work on Sundays when the employee was initially hired.  In no 
26event, however, may any store having more than 5,000 square feet of interior 
27customer selling space be open on Easter Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas 
28Day.

37meaning as in Title 22, section 2491, subsection 7-B.

2legislation takes effect when approved.

5than 10,000 square feet of interior customer selling space to be open on Easter Day,
