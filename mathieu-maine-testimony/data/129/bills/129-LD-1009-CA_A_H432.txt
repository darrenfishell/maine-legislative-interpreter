21 step therapy protocol during the consideration of a request for a step therapy override 
22 exception determination. The amendment also adds a definition of "stable on a 
23 prescription drug" and clarifies that the provisions do not prevent a carrier from requiring 
24 an enrollee to try an interchangeable biological product. The amendment also changes 
25 the allocation of a new section of the statutory provision to avoid a numbering problem.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Drug step therapy is the practice of beginning drug therapy for a medical condition with the most cost-effective and 
safest drug and progressing to other more costly or risky therapies only if necessary, with the goal of controlling costs 
and minimizing risks. This bill adds an exception process that must be clear, readily accessible and convenient to the 
patient and presc1iber. The Maine State Employee Health Plan does not pem1it step therapy and will not be affected 
by this bill.
