13have a fish tissue residue criterion for human health of 0.03 milligrams per 
14kilogram in the edible portion of fish.
15Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §465-A, sub-§1, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 193, §4, is

3SUMMARY
4This bill creates a sustenance fishing designated use as a subcategory of the 
5applicable fishing designated use for certain specified water body segments within 
6Maine’s water classification program where there is or may be sustenance fishing or 
7increased fish consumption by members of the Indian tribes in Maine or other Maine 
8citizens.  This bill also requires that the Department of Environmental Protection adopt 
9routine technical rules no later than March 1, 2020 that calculate and establish water 
10quality criteria protective of human health for toxic pollutants and the sustenance fishing 
11designated use as established by this bill.  This bill limits the scope of the sustenance 
12fishing designated use created by this bill by providing that, for all purposes, the 
13sustenance fishing designated use created by this bill is deemed protected through water 
14quality criteria for human health calculated and established for the identified water body 
15segments.
