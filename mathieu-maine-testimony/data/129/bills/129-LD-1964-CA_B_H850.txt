31camp programs or their employees;

2Any person may request that such a petition be made confidential; and
3B.  Any person may request access to inspect a juvenile petition that alleges murder 
4or a Class A crime committed by a juvenile under 13 years of age, or a Class B or C 
5crime committed by a juvenile of any age.  If a request to allow such inspection is 
6filed, a hearing on the request must be held, and notice of the hearing must be given 
7to the juvenile, the juvenile's parents or guardians, the attorney representing the 
8juvenile, the office of the prosecuting attorney and the person requesting access to the 
9petition;

24juvenile completes probation, completes a period of confinement or is discharged 
25from a commitment.  The District Attorney's office must provide notice to the court 
26when the juvenile was ordered to pay restitution or complete some other obligation

29the court, but must provide proof of such completion to the prosecuting attorney;
30B.  The amendment reiterates that, in accordance with existing law, courts, criminal 
31justice agencies and the person whose juvenile records are sealed may have access to 
32those sealed records;
33C.  The amendment clarifies that sealing juvenile case records does not enable the 
34person to whom the records relate to possess a firearm if the person is prohibited 
35from doing so as a result of the adjudication to which the sealed juvenile case records 
36relate; and
37D.  The amendment establishes that a person has a right to appeal a court's denial of 
38the person's petition to seal a juvenile case record.

40juvenile court records regarding adjudications for murder or Class A, B or C crimes or
