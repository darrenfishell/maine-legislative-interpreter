alternates representing the public may not have worked in a management capacity or 
represented employer interests in any proceedings or have worked for a labor 
organization or served in a leadership role in a labor organization at any time during the 
prior 6 years. The member representing the public serves as the board's chair and the 
alternate representing the public serves as an alternate chair. Members of the board are 
entitled to compensation according to the provisions of Title 5, chapter 379. The 
altemates are entitled to compensation at the same per diem rate as the member that the 
alternate replaces. The term of each member and each alternate is 4 years, except that of

receipt of a request for services and collect those costs prior to providing the services. 
2 The executive director shall bill or reimburse the parties, as appropriate, for any 
3 difference between the estimated costs that were collected and the actual costs of 
4 providing the services. Once one party has paid its share of the estimated cost of 
5 providing the service, the matter is scheduled for hearing. A party who has not paid an 
6 invoice for the estimated or actual cost of providing services within 60 days of the date 
7 the invoice was issued is, in the absence of good cause shown, liable for the amount of 
8 the invoice together with a penalty in the amount of 25% of the amount of the invoice.

15 may allocate all costs to a party that presents a frivolous complaint or defense or that

17 meets on administrative or other matters that do not concern the interests of particular
