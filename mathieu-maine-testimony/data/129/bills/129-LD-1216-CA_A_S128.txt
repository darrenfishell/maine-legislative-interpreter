Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part GGG authorized the Department of Education to designate 3 community schools 
as part of a 5-year pilot program beginning in the 2016-2017 school year and provided a General Fund appropriation 
of $150 ,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to support the pilot program. General Fund support for the pilot program has been 
included in the funding for the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools (GPA) program in fiscal years 2017-18 and 
2018-19 and is included in LD 1001, the proposed budget for the 2020-2021 biennium. 
This legislation makes the community school pilot project permanent and increases the number of schools that may be 
designated as a community school for the 2020-2021 school year from 3 to 5 and allows for an additional 10 
beginning in the 2021-2022 school year. It also requires the department to apply for available federal funds to support 
the implementation and expansion of community schools. This bill includes Federal Expenditures Fund base 
allocations of$500 per year, beginning in fiscal year 2020-21 to a newly created Community Schools Program 
account within the department to allow expenditure of any federal funds that may be awarded. 
If sufficient federal funds are not received to support the full cost of the community schools program, support may be 
required through future General Fund appropriations or as part of future funding appropriated for GP A. Funding 
allocated for community schools within GP A in future biennia will impact the distribution of state subsidy to local 
school administrative units. 
Finally, this bill continues the department's authority to employ a state community school coordinator to implement 
the program. The department has never filled this position and is uncertain whether additional staff will be needed for 
this purpose. If the need becomes evident, the department will submit a budget request.
