12SUMMARY
13Surgical technologists are individuals with specialized education who function as 
14members of a surgical team by providing support during every phase of a surgical case.  
15This bill requires health care facilities to employ or contract with only certified surgical 
16technologists for this function.  A surgical technologist who is not certified, but who is 
17practicing surgical technology on the effective date of this legislation, may continue in 
18that employment after the effective date.  After the effective date, a health care facility 
19may hire a noncertified surgical technologist who is a recent graduate, but the individual 
20is required to obtain certification within 6 months of graduation in order to remain 
21employed.  Further, a critical access hospital may employ a noncertified surgical 
22technologist if that facility is unable to recruit certified personnel and maintains a record 
23detailing its recruitment efforts.  All employed surgical technologists, regardless of 
24certification status, must meet stated continuing education requirements.  Nothing in the 
25bill prohibits a licensed practitioner from performing surgical technology duties that fall 
26within the scope of that person's license.
