38 minimum number of horses is not available,

40 Conservation and Forestry develops a recommended operating budget for the operating 
41 account for the commission.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "4" to H.P. 1149, L.D. 1590 
1 The amendment strikes from the bill the requirement that an off-track betting facility 
2 within a SO-mile radius of a commercial track must pay 1 % of the wagers made during 
3 the time live racing is being conducted on race day and 0.5% of the wagers made during 
4 the time that live racing is not being conducted on race day. 
5 Cun-ent law requires licensees to pay funds to a statewide association of horsemen to 
6 supplement purses. The amendment requires the commission to disburse funds directly 
7 to a statewide association of horsemen to supplement purses. 
8 The amendment revises the provision in the bill that allows an off-track betting 
9 facility to be located within a facility licensed to serve alcohol that is owned by an owner 
10 other than the off-track betting facility owner. The amendment provides that a person 
11 may conduct pari-mutuel wagering at an off-track betting facility that is licensed if the 
12 facility is located and operated within a licensed hotel with public dining facilities, a 
13 Class A lounge, a Class A restaurant or a Class A restaurant/lounge. 
14 The amendment retains the requirement in cun-ent law that an applicant for an off-
15 track betting license notify commercial tracks within 50 miles of the proposed off-track 
16 betting facility. 
17 The amendment retains the requirement in cun-ent law that an applicant for an off-
18 track betting license notify and allow objections from existing off-track betting facilities 
19 within 35 miles. 
20 The amendment strikes from the bill the section relating to reduced payments for 
21 facilities licensed after January 1, 2019 owned by a federally recognized Indian tribe. 
22 The amendment provides that the amounts payable to the Stipend Fund from an off-
23 track betting facility newly licensed after January 1, 2020 must be divided among 
24 agricultural fair licensees based on the number of days raced in conjunction with the 
25 annual agricultural fairs of the licensees. 
26 The bill provides that an agricultural fair licensee qualifies for funds from the fund to 
27 supplement harness racing purses by conducting an extended meet, removing the 
28 requirement that the licensee has conducted an extended meet in 2005. The amendment 
29 retains this requirement. The amendment also provides that an agricultural fair licensee 
30 qualifies for funds from the fund to supplement harness racing purses if that fair licensee 
31 has been awarded live race dates by the commission upon closure of an existing 
32 commercial track that is not replaced. 
33 The amendment increases the maximum of race day credits that may be awarded per 
34 commercial track during the months of March and December from 12 to 16. 
35 The amendment provides that if the commission determines that a commercial track 
36 ceased or agreed to cease operation prior to March 1, 2021 following a request from a 
37 bona fide statewide organization of horsemen to facilitate the prospect that a modernized 
38 commercial track might open, notwithstanding the requirements of the Maine Revised 
39 Statutes, Title 8, section 275-D, the operator of the former commercial track or an entity 
40 controlled by its owners is entitled to a license to operate an off-track betting facility in 
41 the same municipality of the commercial track at or after the time the commercial track 
42 ceases operation as a commercial track.
