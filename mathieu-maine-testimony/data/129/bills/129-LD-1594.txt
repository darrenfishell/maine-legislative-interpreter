35in the State;
36(2)  Through an analysis of collections by the plaintiff organization that are found 
37by the court to be reasonably representative of total collections in the State; or
38(3)  Through any other method that the court finds reliable in establishing the 
39defendant producer's fair share of the plaintiff organization's actual costs.
40D.  An action may not be commenced under this subsection against a potential 
41defendant producer until 60 days after a plaintiff organization provides to all potential 
42defendant producers a written notice of the claim setting forth the amount of the

15SUMMARY
16This bill provides for the establishment of a stewardship program for consumer 
17batteries, including both single-use and rechargeable batteries and certain products 
18containing these batteries.  Under the bill, a producer of consumer batteries or an 
19organization composed of one or more producers of such batteries must submit a plan for 
20the establishment of a battery stewardship program to the Commissioner of 
21Environmental Protection for approval.  Once approved, the program must operate to 
22provide convenient, free statewide collection opportunities for discarded batteries, and the 
23batteries collected through the program must be recycled or otherwise responsibly 
24managed.  The bill also amends and repeals existing laws relating to certain battery types 
25to avoid statutory conflict with the stewardship program for consumer batteries.
