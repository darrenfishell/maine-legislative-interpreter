36drugs must comply with the following.

14the implementation and adoption of real-time electronic transmission, any such entity 
15must be capable of supporting and using standards recommended by a national 
16institute for the development of fair standards and adopted by a national council for 
17prescription drug programs for electronic prescribing transactions.  Any additional 
18cost to a carrier may not be passed on to an enrollee as a component of the premium.

20the point of prescribing and must include any options available to the enrollee, 
21including the cost of a prescription drug at the enrollee's pharmacy of choice, the cost 
22of mail order when available, any costs for using a specialty pharmacy if applicable 
23and the cost to the enrollee if the enrollee pays out of pocket.

30choices related to prescription drugs.  A provider shall communicate with an enrollee 
31about the most therapeutically appropriate treatment for the enrollee's given diagnosis.

33cost of prescription drugs, including the cost to the enrollee if the enrollee pays out of 
34pocket, alternative prescription drugs and prescription delivery options.
35This subsection may not be construed to prohibit the right of an enrollee to choose 
36whether to use the prescription drug coverage available through the enrollee's health plan 
37when obtaining prescription drugs.  If an enrollee chooses not to use the enrollee's health 
38plan's prescription drug coverage for a prescription drug being prescribed by a provider, a 
39provider has no obligation to convey this information to the carrier or pharmacy benefits 
40manager.
41Sec. 7.  Bureau of Insurance to monitor compliance.  Beginning January 1, 
422021, the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance shall

7the carrier as appropriate.  The joint standing committee of the Legislature having
