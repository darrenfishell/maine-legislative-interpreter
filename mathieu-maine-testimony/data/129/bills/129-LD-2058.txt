33SUMMARY
34This bill specifies the categories of care providers for whom the Department of 
35Health and Human Services must maintain a reportable event and adult protective 
36services system.  This bill requires the department to establish and maintain an adult 
37protective services registry of persons for whom there have been substantiated reports of 
38abuse, neglect or exploitation of dependent adults or incapacitated adults.  This bill 
39changes current law, which limits registry entries to cases in which the person abused,

2registry entries to cases involving incapacitated adults and dependent adults.
