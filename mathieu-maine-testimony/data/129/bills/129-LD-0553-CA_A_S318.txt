SUMMARY 
2 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes and replaces

6 federally recognized Indian tribes are eligible to apply for facility sports wagering

8 to apply for mobile sports wagering licenses to conduct sports wagering through mobile 
9 applications or digital platforms, as are qualified gaming entities that offer sports 
10 wagering through mobile applications or digital platforms in any jurisdiction in the 
11 United States pursuant to a state regulatory structure. Facility sports wagering licensees 
12 and mobile sports wagering licensees, referred to in the amendment as operators, may 
13 purchase or lease equipment, systems or services for sports wagering from entities with a 
14 supplier license, whose equipment, systems or services must meet standards established 
15 by rule. Operators may also enter into written contracts, approved by the director of the 
16 Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety, with management 
17 services licensees that have sufficient knowledge and experience in the business of 
18 operating sports wagering to effectively conduct sports wagering on behalf of operators. 
19 A person employed by a facility sports wagering licensee to be engaged directly in sports 
20 wagering-related activities must be licensed by the Gambling Control Unit. 
21 Operators may accept wagers on professional, collegiate and amateur sports events, 
22 including international events, as well as on the individual performances of athletes, on 
23 motor vehicle races and on electronic sports. Sports wagers are prohibited on high school 
24 events, other events where a majority of participants are less than 18 years of age and 
25 events involving Maine-based colleges and universities. Operators may not accept sports 
26 wagers from individuals under 21 years of age; participants in the sports event, including 
27 athletes and officials; persons with an interest in the outcome of the sports event 
28 identified by the director by rule; the operator's own directors or employees or persons 
29 living in their households; persons voluntarily or involuntarily placed on a list maintained 
30 by the Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety of persons not 
31 authorized to make sports wagers; 3rd persons making wagers on behalf of another 
32 person; and Gambling Control Unit employees. Mobile sports wagering licensees are 
33 also prohibited from accepting sports wagers from persons who are not physically located 
34 within the State. 
35 A facility sports wagering licensee must remit 10% of the licensee's adjusted gross 
36 sports wagering receipts to the State and a mobile sports wagering licensee must remit 
37 16% of the licensee's adjusted gross sports wagering receipts to the State. One percent of 
38 adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the General Fund for the 
39 administrative expenses of the Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public 
40 Safety and 1 % of the adjusted gross sports wagering receipts must be deposited in the 
41 Gambling Addiction Prevention and Treatment Fund established by the Maine Revised 
42 Statutes, Title 5, section 20006-B. The remaining adjusted gross sports wagering receipts 
43 remitted to the State must be deposited in the General Fund. 
44 The amendment also allows a licensed fantasy contest operator to offer a fantasy 
45 contest based on the performances of participants in collegiate athletic events.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill authorizes the Gambling Control Unit (GCU) within the Department of Public Safety, to regulate sports 
wagering in the State and directs that 10% of gross sports wagering facility revenue and 16% of gross sports 
wagering mobile revenue be credited to the General Fund, 1 % be credited to the GCU for administrative expenses 
and 1 % be credited to the Gambling Addiction and Prevention Treatment Fund. Facility and mobile operators will 
retain the remainder of the gross. General fund revenue of $1,311,00 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $2,622,000 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 and Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $95,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $190,000 in fiscal 
year 2020-21 is estimated to be generated from sports wagering. The estimate prorates assumptions contained in the 
May 2017, Oxford Economics' "Economic Impact of Legalized Sports Betting" report, using the criteria of moderate 
availability for in-person sports wagering and convenient availability for mobile wagering. 
LR0069(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2

Special Revenue Funds revenue of $470,250 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $3,250 in fiscal year 2020-21. License fee 
revenue assumes that two casinos and one commercial racetrack will have both facility and mobile sports betting,

mobile license and six online vendors and two Indian tribes will only seek mobile licenses.
