111.  Claim.  "Claim" means a request for reimbursement under this chapter.
122.  Homestead.  "Homestead" means the owner-occupied principal dwelling, either 
13real or personal property, owned by the taxpayer and up to 10 contiguous acres upon 
14which it is located.  If the homestead is located in a multi-unit building, the homestead is 
15the portion of the building actually used as the principal dwelling and its percentage of 
16the value of the common elements and of the value of the tax lot upon which it is built.  
17The percentage is the value of the unit consisting of the homestead compared to the total 
18value of the building exclusive of the common elements, if any.
193.  Household.  "Household" means a claimant and spouse and members of the 
20household for whom the claimant is entitled to claim an exemption as dependents under 
21Part 8 for the year for which reimbursement is requested.
224.  Liquid asset.  "Liquid asset" means something of value available to an individual 
23that can be converted to cash in 3 months or less and includes bank accounts, certificates 
24of deposit, money market or mutual funds, life insurance policies, stocks and bonds, 
25lump-sum payments, inheritances and funds from a home equity conversion mortgage 
26that are in the individual's possession whether they are in cash or have been converted to 
27another form.
285.  Retirement age.  "Retirement age" has the same meaning as under 42 United 
29States Code, Section 416(l).
306.  Taxes.  "Taxes" means ad valorem taxes and assessments on a homestead.
317.  Taxpayer.  "Taxpayer" means an individual who has filed a claim for 
32reimbursement under this chapter or 2 or more individuals who have jointly filed a claim 
33for reimbursement under this chapter.
Page 2 - 129LR2105(01)-11§6173.  Claim is personal
2The right to file a claim for reimbursement under this chapter is personal to the 
3taxpayer and does not survive the taxpayer's death, but the right may be exercised on 
4behalf of a taxpayer by the taxpayer's legal guardian or attorney-in-fact. If a taxpayer dies 
5after having filed a timely claim, the amount of the reimbursement must be disbursed to 
6another member of the household as determined by the assessor.
7If the taxpayer was the only member of a household, the reimbursement may be paid 
8to the taxpayer's personal representative, but if one is not appointed within 2 years of the 
9filing of the claim, the amount of the reimbursement reverts to the State.
10§6174.  Reimbursement to be paid from the General Fund
11The amount of a reimbursement certified by the assessor under section 6175 must be 
12paid to the taxpayer from the General Fund.  Interest is not allowed on any payment made 
13to a taxpayer pursuant to this chapter.
14§6175.  Procedure for reimbursement
15Within 30 days of receiving a claim under section 6176, the assessor shall determine 
16if a taxpayer is eligible for reimbursement and the amount of the taxes to be reimbursed 
17under section 6177 and shall certify that amount to the Treasurer of the State who shall 
18make payment to the taxpayer on or before the 15th day of the following month.
19§6176.  Filing a claim; eligibility standards
201.  Eligibility.  A taxpayer is eligible for reimbursement under this chapter if:

30105, subchapter 4-B for the homestead for which a claim is made.
312.  Filing claim.  An individual may annually file a claim for reimbursement under 
32this chapter with the bureau on or after August 1st but no later than April 1st of the 
33following year.  Claims must be filed on a form approved by the assessor and include all 
34information requested by the assessor.
35§6177.  Reimbursement amount
36A taxpayer determined eligible for reimbursement under this chapter must receive 
37reimbursement for the difference between the taxes assessed in the year the taxpayer

2except that claims of less than $5 may not be granted.
3§6178.  One claim
4Only one taxpayer per homestead per year is entitled to reimbursement under this 
5chapter.
6§6179.  Administration
7The assessor shall make available forms with instructions for individuals to claim 
8reimbursement under this chapter.  A claim must be in the form prescribed by the 
9assessor and must require a signature by the individual claiming reimbursement.  The 
10assessor shall also provide a paperless option for filing an application under this chapter.
11§6180.  Audit
12If, on the audit of any claim filed under this chapter, the assessor determines the 
13amount of reimbursement to have been incorrectly determined, the assessor shall 
14redetermine the claim and shall notify the taxpayer of the redetermination and the reasons 
15for it.  The redetermination is reviewable in accordance with section 151.  If the claim has 
16been paid, the amount paid in excess of that legally due is subject to interest at the rate 
17determined pursuant to section 186.  The assessor may credit amounts payable to a 
18taxpayer under this chapter against a liability of that taxpayer pursuant to this section.
19§6181.  Denial of claim
201.  Fraudulent claim.  If the assessor determines that a claim under this chapter is 
21excessive and was filed with fraudulent intent, the claim must be disallowed in full.  If the 
22claim has been paid, the amount paid may be recovered by assessment, collection and 
23enforcement in the manner provided in chapter 7.  A person who, with fraudulent intent, 
24files or prepares an excessive claim, assists in the preparation or filing of an excessive 
25claim or supplies information in support of an excessive claim commits a Class E crime.
262.  Negligent claim.  If the assessor determines that a claim under this chapter is 
27excessive and was negligently prepared, the amount claimed in excess of that legally due

32and the spouse of that person are disqualified from receiving reimbursement under this 
33chapter.
34§6182.  Appeal
35A denial in whole or in part of relief claimed under this chapter may be appealed in 
36accordance with section 151.
Page 4 - 129LR2105(01)-11§6183.  Disqualification of claim
2If the assessor finds that the taxpayer received title to the homestead primarily for the 
3purpose of receiving reimbursement under this chapter, the claim is disqualified.
4§6184.  Extension of time for filing claim
5In case of sickness, absence or other disability, or if, in the judgment of the assessor, 
6good cause exists, the assessor may extend, for a period not to exceed 2 months, the time 
7for filing a claim.  A request for an extension may be submitted at any time during the 
82-month extension period.
