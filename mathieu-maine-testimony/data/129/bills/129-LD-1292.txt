4A.  By November 1st annually, the State Tax Assessor shall calculate the amount by 
5which the income tax rates under Title 36, section 5111, subsections 1-F, 2-F and 3-F 
6may be reduced during the subsequent tax year using the amount available from the 
7fund. Bracket rate reductions must be a minimum of 0.2 percentage points in the first 
8year in which reductions are made and a minimum of 0.1 percentage points in 
9subsequent years. If sufficient funds are not available to pay for the minimum 
10reduction, a rate reduction may not be made until the amount in the fund is sufficient 
11to pay for the reduction. When the amount is sufficient to pay for the reduction, the 
12reduction must first be applied equally to each bracket under Title 36, section 5111, 
13subsections 1-F, 2-F and 3-F until the lower bracket reaches 4%. Funds available 
14from the fund in subsequent years must be applied to reduce the higher bracket rates 
15until there is a single bracket with a rate of 4%, after which future tax relief may be 
16identified.
