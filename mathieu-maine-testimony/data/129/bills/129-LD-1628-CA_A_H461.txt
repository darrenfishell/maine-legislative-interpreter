SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the bill as follows. 
1. It includes a definition for the term "recycling" or "recycle" as applicable to the 
container redemption laws. 
2. It authorizes the Department of Environmental Protection to conduct audits of 
beverage containers prepared for pickup by pick-up agents at redemption centers and to 
adopt rules regarding such audits. 
3. It amends the bill to provide that a dealer of beverage containers with 5 ,000 or 
more square feet of retail space must accept beverage container returns unless the dealer 
has a written agreement with a redemption center located within 10 miles of the dealer, or 
with the redemption center in closest proximity to the dealer, to provide redemption 
services on the dealer's behalf. 
4. It retains in the law the exception from the population requirements for licensing 
of redemption centers by distributors, but removes the exception for food establishments. 
The bill removed the exception for both food establishments and distributors. 
5. It requires that no later than November 1, 2019, each initiator of deposit and each 
pick-up agent that is not an initiator of deposit must report to the department information 
regarding its beverage container sales and redemptions for calendar year 2018, which the 
department must use in developing findings and recommendations for inclusion in a 
report, due January 15, 2020, to the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources. The committee is authorized to rep01t out legislation to implement 
those recommendations.

This bill implements the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) recommendations regarding the State's 
beverage container redemption laws as included in the DEP's annual report on the State's product stewardship 
programs. The recommendations include; increasing the annual license fee for redemption centers from $50 to $100, 
creating specific responsibilities of initiators of deposit regarding container pick-ups, clarification of the rules 
regarding commingling agreements, a requirement that all initiators of deposit enter into a commingling agreement 
by January 1, 2023, clarification of the licensing requirements for redemption centers and adding new reporting 
requirements for initiators of deposit and redemption centers. 
Under current law, unclaimed deposits for redeemable beverage containers not subject to a commingling agreement 
are turned over to the State and eventually are credited to the General Fund. A requirement that all initiators of 
deposit enter into a commingling agreement would reduce General Fund revenue by approximately $1,250,000 in 
fiscal year 2022-23 and by $2,500,000 annually afterward. An increase to the annual license fee for redemption 
centers will increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue. The amount of increase is not expected to be significant.
