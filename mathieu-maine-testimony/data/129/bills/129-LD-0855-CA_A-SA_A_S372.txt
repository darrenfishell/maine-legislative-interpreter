This amendment removes the permit surcharge from the bill and reduces Other Special Revenue Funds revenue 
relative to the committee amendment by $203,280 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20. Because the bill as amended no 
longer requires municipalities to collect and remit the permit surcharge, the mandate preamble is removed. The 
amendment also removes the Other Special Revenue Funds positions and allocations from the bill. 
As amended, this bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds deallocations of $30,000 per year to the Community 
Development Block Grant program within the Department of Economic and Community Development due to the 
responsibility for the training and certification of code enforcement officers being transferred to the Department of 
Public Safety.
