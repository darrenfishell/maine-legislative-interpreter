Page 1 - 129LR3103(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, current law requires a small water utility with gross annual revenues of no 
4more than $50,000 to have an audit performed by an independent certified public 
5accountant for any year the utility seeks a rate adjustment; and
6Whereas, this requirement imposes a disproportionate financial burden on these 
7small water utilities that prevents them from seeking an adjustment in rates, which could 
8lead to inadequate revenue for the utility and adversely affect its ability to provide 
9services to its customers; and
10Whereas, in order to avoid these adverse consequences, some ability to relieve 
11small water utilities of this burden quickly when appropriate is necessary; and 
12Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
14immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
15therefore,
16Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
17Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §505, sub-§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 77, §1, is 
18amended to read:
19A.  A qualified small water utility with gross annual revenues of $50,000 or less shall 
20for any year used as a test year for rate-making purposes cause to be conducted, in 
21accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, an audit of its accounts by an 
22independent certified public accountant licensed to practice in the State.  The 
23commission, for good cause shown by the qualified small water utility, may waive 
24the requirements of this paragraph.
25Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
26legislation takes effect when approved.
27SUMMARY
28Under current law, a qualified small water utility with gross annual revenues of 
29$50,000 or less is required to have an independent audit of internal accounts of that water 
30utility performed by a certified public accountant for any year the water utility seeks a 
31rate increase.
32This bill allows the Public Utilities Commission to waive that independent audit 
33requirement if the water utility shows good cause as to why the requirement should be 
34waived.
