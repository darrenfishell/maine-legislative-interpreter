Page 1 - 129LR2054(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §221, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 
3affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:
41.  Application.  This section applies when either weekly or lump sum payments are 
5made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 212 or 213 with respect to 
6the same time period for which the employee is also receiving or has received payments 
7for:
8A.  Old-age insurance benefit payments under the United States Social Security Act, 
942 United States Code, Sections 301 to 1397f;
10B.  Payments under a self-insurance plan, a wage continuation plan or a disability 
11insurance policy provided by the employer; or.
12C.  Pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or 
13maintained by the employer.
14This section does not apply to payments made to an employee as a result of liability 
15pursuant to section 212, subsection 2 or 3 for the specific loss period set forth by law.  It 
16is the intent of the Legislature that, because benefits under section 212, subsections 2 and 
173 are benefits that recognize human factors substantially in addition to the wage loss 
18concept, coordination of benefits should not apply to such benefits.
19Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §221, sub-§2, ¶A, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 
20647, §15, is amended to read:
21A.  "After-tax amount" means:
22(1)  For benefits paid on claims for which the date of injury is prior to January 1, 
232013, the gross amount of any benefit under subsection 3, paragraph A, 
24subparagraph (2), or (3), (4) or (5) reduced by the prorated weekly amount that 
25would have been paid, if any, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 
26United States Code, Sections 3101 to 3126, state income tax and federal income 
27tax, calculated on an annual basis using as the number of exemptions the disabled 
28employee's dependents plus the employee, and without excess itemized 
29deductions. In determining the after-tax amount the tables provided for in section 
30102, subsection 1 must be used. The gross amount of any benefit under 
31subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (2), or (3), (4) or (5) is presumed to be 
32the same as the average weekly wage for purposes of the table. The applicable 
3380% of after-tax amount as provided in the table, multiplied by 1.25, is 
34conclusive for determining the after-tax amount of benefits under subsection 3, 
35paragraph A, subparagraph (2), or (3), (4) or (5); and
36(2)  For benefits paid on claims for which the date of injury is on or after January 
371, 2013, the net weekly amount of any old-age insurance benefit or benefit under 
38an employee benefit plan, reduced by the prorated weekly amount that would 
39have been paid, if any, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 United 
40States Code, Sections 3101 to 3126, federal income and state income taxes, 
41calculated on an annual basis.  The after-tax amount of any benefit subject to 
Page 2 - 129LR2054(01)-11income taxes must be determined by using the maximum number of dependents' 
2allowances to which the employee is entitled and the standard deduction or zero 
3bracket amount applicable to the employee's filing status.
4Sec. 3.  39-A MRSA §221, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 152, §1, is 
5further amended to read:
6A.  The employer's obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than 
7benefits under section 212, subsection 2 or 3 is reduced by the following amounts:
8(1)  Fifty percent of the amount of the old-age insurance benefits received or 
9being received under the United States Social Security Act.  For injuries 
10occurring on or after October 1, 1995, such a reduction may not be made if the 
11old-age insurance benefits had started prior to the date of injury or if the benefits 
12are spouse's benefits;
13(2)  The after-tax amount of the payments received or being received under a 
14self-insurance plan or a wage continuation plan or under a disability insurance 
15policy provided by the same employer from whom benefits under section 212 or 
16213 are received if the employee did not contribute directly to the plan or to the 
17payment of premiums regarding the disability insurance policy. If the self-
18insurance plans, wage continuation plans or disability insurance policies are 
19entitled to repayment in the event of a workers' compensation benefit recovery, 
20the insurance carrier shall satisfy the repayment out of funds the insurance carrier 
21has received through the coordination of benefits provided for under this section; 
22and
23(3)  The proportional amount, based on the ratio of the employer's contributions 
24to the total insurance premiums for the policy period involved, of the after-tax 
25amount of the payments received or being received by the employee pursuant to a 
26disability insurance policy provided by the same employer from whom benefits 
27under section 212 or 213 are received, if the employee did contribute directly to 
28the payment of premiums regarding the disability insurance policy;.
29(5)  The proportional amount, based on the ratio of  that employer's contributions 
30to the total contributions to the plan or program, of the after-tax amount of the 
31pension or retirement payments received or being received by the employee 
32pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer 
33from whom benefits under section 212 or 213 are received, regardless of whether 
34the employee contributed directly to the pension or retirement plan or program; 
35and
36(6)  For those employers who do not provide a pension plan, the proportional 
37amount, based on the ratio of the employer's contributions to the total 
38contributions made to a qualified profit sharing plan under the United States 
39Internal Revenue Code, Section 401(a) or any successor to the United States 
40Internal Revenue Code, Section 401(a) covering a profit sharing plan that 
41provides for the payment of benefits only upon retirement, disability, death, or 
42other separation of employment to the extent that benefits are vested under the 
43plan.

6considered payments from funds provided by the employer and are considered 
7primary payments on the employer's obligation under section 212 or 213 as old-age 
8benefit payments under the Social Security Act are considered pursuant to this 
9section.  However, social security disability insurance benefits may only be so 
10considered if section 224 of the Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Section 
11424a, is revised so that a reduction of social security disability insurance benefits is 
12not made because of the receipt of workers' compensation benefits by the employee. 
13The coordination of social security disability benefits commences on the date of the 
14award certificate of the social security disability benefits. Any accrued social security 
15disability benefits may not be coordinated.

17H.  An employer may not take a credit against ongoing payments to an employee due 
18to the employee's receipt of payments that are eligible for coordination of benefits 
19and that were received during a previous time period.
20Sec. 7.  39-A MRSA §221, sub-§§4 and 5, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A,

31B.  Provide the employer or carrier with proof of that application; and
32C.  Provide the employer or carrier with an authority for release of information which 
33may be used by the employer to obtain necessary benefit entitlement and amount 
34information from the social security administration.

5SUMMARY
6This bill strikes the provisions of law that require an employer to offset an 
7individual's workers' compensation benefits based on retirement or pension benefits being 
8received by that individual.  It also clarifies the law to avoid the interpretation of the 
9Maine Supreme Court in Urrutia v. Interstate Brands International, 2018 ME 24, 179 
10A.3d 312, which allowed an employer to take a credit for past overpayments, due to the 
11employer's failure to take an allowable offset of benefits, by reducing the employer's 
12ongoing payments of workers' compensation benefits.
