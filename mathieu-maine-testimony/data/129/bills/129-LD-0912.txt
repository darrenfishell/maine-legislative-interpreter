23wood energy investment fund established in subsection 2.  The trust shall require Wood 
24Energy Investment Program participants to substantially share in the cost of projects 
25funded under this section.  The trust shall seek to maximize the Wood Energy Investment 
26Program's impact per dollar of expenditure from the wood energy investment fund and

5Commission finds that an entity that was awarded a contract for biomass resources is not 
6meeting contract requirements and therefore is not qualified to receive the full contract 
7payment or any contract payment, those funds that would have been paid to the entity had 
8contract requirements been met must be transferred to the wood energy investment fund 
9established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 10124, subsection 2.  
10Notwithstanding Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection 5, any funds

14SUMMARY
15This bill establishes the wood energy investment fund and creates the Wood Energy 
16Investment Program within the Efficiency Maine Trust.   The bill specifies that, if the 
17Public Utilities Commission finds that an entity awarded a contract for biomass resources 
18pursuant to Public Law 2015, chapter 483 is not meeting contract requirements and 
19therefore is not qualified to receive the full contract payment or any contract payment, 
20those funds that would have been paid had contract requirements been met must be 
21transferred to the wood energy investment fund.  It also specifies that any funds 
22remaining in the cost recovery fund established in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 
231, subsection 5 that are not needed to pay above-market costs for biomass resources must 
24also be transferred by the Public Utilities Commission to the wood energy investment 
25fund. It requires the trust to use funds from the fund, if there are any, to provide 
26incentives and low-interest or no-interest loans for new wood-derived thermal energy or 
27cogeneration projects.  It requires that the trust consult with the Finance Authority of 
28Maine, when appropriate, in the development of any Wood Energy Investment Program 
29incentives and the distribution of money from the wood energy investment fund.  It 
30prohibits the use of funds for incentives or loans for the refurbishment or maintenance of
