7accordance with the procedures set forth in Title 26, chapter 9-A.  In any negotiated 
8agreement, the criteria negotiated by the school board and the bargaining agent to 
9establish the order of layoff and recall must include the teacher's effectiveness rating 
10pursuant to chapter 508 as a factor and may also include, but may not be limited to, 
11seniority.
12Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §13703, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 635, Pt. A, §3, is amended 
13to read:
14§13703.  Use of effectiveness rating

16human capital decision making, including, but not limited to, decision making regarding 
17recruitment, selection, induction, mentoring, professional development, compensation, 
18assignment and dismissal.
19Receipt Subject to an appeal and grievance filed under the terms of an applicable 
20collective bargaining agreement, receipt of summative effectiveness ratings indicating 
21that a teacher is ineffective for 2 consecutive years constitutes just cause for nonrenewal 
22of a teacher's contract unless the ratings are the result of bad faith as long as there is a 
23reasonable basis in fact for the effectiveness ratings, the evaluation process leading to the 
24effectiveness ratings has been performed consistent with the approved system and 
25department rules implementing this chapter and the effectiveness ratings were reached in 
26good faith.
27Any appeal of, or grievance relating to, an evaluation conducted pursuant to this 
28chapter or an effectiveness rating resulting from implementation of a system is limited to 
29matters relating to the implementation of the system or the existence of bad faith in an 
30evaluation or the assignment of a rating.  The professional judgment involved in an 
31evaluation or implementation of the system is not subject to appeal or grievance.
32In accordance with the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, a 
33teacher may file an appeal of and grievance relating to an evaluation conducted pursuant 
34to this chapter or an effectiveness rating issued pursuant to this chapter.  When an appeal 
35or grievance is filed, if there is a reasonable basis in fact for the effectiveness rating, the 
36evaluation process leading to the effectiveness rating has been performed consistent with 
37the approved system and department rules implementing this chapter and the 
38effectiveness rating was reached in good faith, the person or entity authorized to 
39determine the appeal or grievance under the applicable collective bargaining agreement 
40shall determine that the effectiveness rating is supported and must be retained.  If the 
Page 2 - 129LR1177(01)-11person or entity determines that one or more of the criteria are not met, the effectiveness 
2rating must be rescinded.
3SUMMARY
4This bill removes the requirement in current law that the criteria to establish the order 
5of layoff and recall of teachers must include the teacher's effectiveness rating as a factor.  
6It also amends the provisions in current law governing the use of teacher effectiveness 
7ratings.
