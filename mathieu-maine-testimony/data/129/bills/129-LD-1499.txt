14subsection 1 and decide whether to undertake a review of a particular prescription drug 
15that is the subject of a notice under section 2042.  The chair may decide that the board

173.  Role of board members.  A board member may request a vote on whether to 
18undertake a review under subsection 2 if there is not consensus with the decision of the 
19chair.
20ยง2044.  Determining excess costs to payors and consumers
211.  Review of excess costs.  Once a decision has been made to undertake a cost 
22review pursuant to section 2043, the review undertaken by the board must determine if 
23appropriate utilization, fully consistent with the federal Food and Drug Administration 
24label or consistent with standard medical practice, of a prescription drug has led or will 
25lead to excess costs for health care systems in the State.  For the purposes of this section, 
26"excess costs" means:
27A.  Costs of appropriate utilization of a prescription drug that exceed the therapeutic 
28benefit relative to other therapeutic options or alternative treatments; or
29B.  Costs of appropriate utilization of a prescription drug that are not sustainable to 
30public and private health care systems over a 10-year time frame.
312.  Phase one determination.  The board may consider the following factors in 
32determining cost and excess cost:
33A.  The price at which the prescription drug has been or will be sold in the State;
34B.  The average monetary price concession, discount or rebate the manufacturer 
35provides to payors in the State or is expected to provide to payors in the State as 
36reported by manufacturers;
37C.  The price at which therapeutic alternatives have been or will be sold in the State;
Page 6 - 129LR0973(01)-11D.  The average monetary price concession, discount or rebate the manufacturer 
2provides to payors in the State or is expected to provide to payors in the State for 
3therapeutic alternatives;
4E.  The cost to payors based on patient access consistent with federal Food and Drug 
5Administration labeled indications or consistent with standard medical practice;
6F.  The effect on patient access resulting from the cost of the prescription drug 
7relative to insurance benefit design;
8G.  The current or expected value of manufacturer-supported, drug-specific, patient 
9access programs;
10H.  The relative financial effects on health, medical and other social services costs, as 
11can be quantified and compared to baseline effects of existing therapeutic 
12alternatives; and
13I.  Other such factors determined relevant by the board.
143.  Phase 2 determination.  If, after considering the factors in subsection 2, the board 
15is unable to determine if a prescription drug will produce or has produced excess costs, 
16the board may consider the following:
17A.  Manufacturer research and development costs, as shown on the manufacturer's 
18federal tax filing for the most recent tax year, multiplied by the ratio of manufacturer 
19sales in the State to United States sales;
20B.  That portion of direct to consumer marketing costs eligible for favorable federal 
21tax treatment in the most recent tax year that are specific to the prescription drug 
22under review and that are multiplied by the ratio of total manufacturer sales in the 
23State to total manufacturer United States sales for the prescription drug under review;
24C.  Gross and net manufacturer revenues for the most recent tax year; and
25D.  Any additional factors determined by the board relevant to the circumstances, as 
26may be proposed by the manufacturer.
27ยง2045.  Board determinations, compliance and remedies
281.  Rate setting.  In the event the board finds that the cost of the prescription drug 
29under review pursuant to section 2043 creates excess costs as defined in section 2044, 
30subsection 1 for payors and consumers, the board shall establish the rate of 
31reimbursement that must be billed and paid by payors and pharmacies, health care 
32providers administering prescriptions, wholesalers, distributors and uninsured and insured 
33consumers.
342.  Compliance with rate setting.  The failure to bill and pay for a prescription drug 
35at the rate set by the board under subsection 1 constitutes a violation of this chapter and 
36must be referred to the Attorney General for enforcement.  Upon a finding of 
37noncompliance with the board requirements, the Attorney General may pursue any 
38remedy available under civil and criminal law.  The Attorney General may not consider a 
39person in noncompliance with this chapter if a payor obtains price concessions from a 
40manufacturer that result in a payor's net cost being lower than the rate established by the 
Page 7 - 129LR0973(01)-11board.  The Attorney General shall provide guidance to stakeholders concerning activities 
2that could be considered noncompliant and payment transactions in which prescription 
3drug costs exceed the board-established limit.
43.  Compliance with reporting.  The failure of a manufacturer to submit a notice 
5under section 2042 constitutes a violation of this chapter and must be referred to the 
6Attorney General for enforcement.  Upon a finding of noncompliance with the board 
7requirements, the Attorney General may pursue any remedy available under civil law.
8ยง2046.  Appeals
91.  Appeals.  A person affected by a decision of the board may appeal the decision 
10within 30 days.  The full board shall consider the appeal and render a decision within 60 
11days.
122.  Judicial review.  A decision of the board after appeal is subject to judicial review.
13ยง2047.  Annual reports
14Beginning January 1, 2021, and annually thereafter, the board shall report to the 
15Governor, the Legislature and the public on general prescription drug price trends, the 
16number of manufacturers required to provide notice under section 2042 because of 
17prescription drug pricing decisions and the number of prescription drugs that were subject 
18to board review and analysis, including the results of that analysis, as well as the number 
19and disposition of appeals and judicial reviews.

26SUMMARY
27This bill creates the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board to determine the 
28reasonableness of the costs for certain prescription drug products.  The bill requires 
29prescription drug manufacturers to notify the board when the introductory price or 
30proposed price increase for a brand-name or generic drug reaches a specified threshold.  
31The board is directed to review the information submitted by manufacturers to justify the 
32price or increase.
33The bill requires the board to have a public process for each prescription drug 
34required to be reviewed based on certain criteria.  The board is directed to determine if 
35the cost to the health care system of appropriate utilization of a drug is commensurate 
36with its benefit to the system and whether the drug is affordable to state residents.  If the 
37board finds that the cost in the State is not affordable to state health care systems and Health care Maine Prescription
