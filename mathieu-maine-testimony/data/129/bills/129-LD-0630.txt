Page 1 - 129LR2386(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the federal Food and Drug Administration, in response to the passage of 
4the federal Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, released a statement announcing that it 
5is unlawful under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to introduce food containing 
6added cannabidiol into interstate commerce because it is an active ingredient in a 
7federally approved pharmaceutical drug; and
8Whereas, the health inspection program within the Maine Centers for Disease 
9Control in the Department of Health and Human Services has sent letters to retail food 
10establishments in the State and regulators from the Department of Agriculture, 
11Conservation and Forestry have contacted pet stores explaining that any food or food 
12products containing hemp-derived cannabidiol must be removed from shelves, even if 
13those food or food products are not introduced into interstate commerce, which has 
14created anxiety and confusion among business owners, stakeholders and consumers alike; 
15and
16Whereas, any compliance with the letters or statements from the Department of 
17Health and Human Services or the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 
18which expand the federal Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate only food 
19that enters into interstate commerce, will undermine state sovereignty, diminish the 
20livelihoods of Maine hemp farmers, food producers and retailers and deprive the people 
21of Maine of the food that they consider necessary for their own or their animals' health 
22and well-being; and
23Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
24the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
25immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
26therefore,
27Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
28PART A
29Sec. A-1.  22 MRSA §2158-A is enacted to read:

35adulterated or misbranded under this subchapter based solely on the inclusion of hemp or 
36any part of the hemp plant. The nonpharmaceutical or nonmedical production, marketing, 
37sale or distribution of food or food products within the State that contain hemp or any part 
38of the hemp plant may not be restricted or prohibited within the State based solely on the
