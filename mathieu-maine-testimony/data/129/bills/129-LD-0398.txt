Page 1 - 129LR1674(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §10109, sub-§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 282, §2, is 
3further amended to read:
4A.  The trust shall allocate 50% of the funds for residential programs and 50% for 
5commercial and industrial programs.  Trust funds must be allocated for measures, 
6investments, loans, technical assistance and arrangements that reduce electricity 
7consumption, increase energy efficiency or reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
8lower energy costs at commercial or industrial facilities and for investment in 
9measures that lower residential heating energy demand and reduce greenhouse gas 
10emissions.  The measures that lower residential heating demand must be fuel-neutral 
11and may include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency improvements to residential 
12buildings and upgrades to efficient heating systems that will reduce residential energy 
13costs and greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the board.  The trust shall 
14ensure that measures to reduce the cost of residential heating are available for low-
15income households as defined by the trust.  When promoting electricity cost and 
16consumption reduction, the trust may consider measures at commercial and industrial 
17facilities that also lower peak capacity demand.  Subject to the apportionment 
18pursuant to this subsection, the trust shall fund conservation programs that give 
19priority to measures with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, as long as cost-effective 
20collateral efficiency opportunities are not lost, and that:
21(1)  Reliably reduce greenhouse gas production and heating energy costs by fossil 
22fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per 
23unit of emissions; or
24(2)  Reliably increase the efficiency with which energy in the State is consumed 
25at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit of energy saved.
26Notwithstanding this paragraph, during fiscal years 2017-18 to 2019-20, the trust is 
27not required to allocate 50% of the funds to residential programs and 50% of the 
28funds to commercial and industrial programs and may instead allocate those funds to 
29programs at the trust's discretion.
30SUMMARY
31This bill removes the provision that requires the Efficiency Maine Trust to allocate 
3250% of the funds in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund for residential 
33programs and 50% for commercial and industrial programs.
