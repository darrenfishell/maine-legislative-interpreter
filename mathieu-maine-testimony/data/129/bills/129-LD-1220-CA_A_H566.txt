13 SUMMARY 
14 This amendment is the majority report of the committee and replaces the bill. It 
15 amends the provisions of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System regarding 
16 compensation and service retirement benefits for retired state employees, retired teachers 
17 and retired school administrators who return to service as classroom-based employees or 
18 school administrators in the following ways. 
19 1. It removes the 5-year limit on a retired state employee or retired teacher to be 
20 restored to service. 
21 2. It removes the cap of 75% of compensation established for the position that the 
22 retired state employee or retired teacher is filling. 
23 3. It allows a retired state employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator 
24 who returns to service to receive retirement, health, dental and life insurance benefits as 
25 negotiated by the retired state employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator or 
26 as required under collective bargaining agreements. 
27 4. It requires that the portions of the employer and employee contributions that go to 
28 pay the retirement system for the unfunded liability and the state group health plan for 
29 health care must be continued at the same contribution rate of the employer and employee 
30 as is required for the position as if the position were filled by an employee who is not a 
31 retired state employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator. A retired state 
32 employee, retired teacher or retired school administrator who returns to service is not a 
33 member and therefore may not accrue additional creditable service during the 
34 reemployment period or change the retired state employee's, retired teacher's or retired 
35 school administrator's eamable compensation for benefit calculation purposes.

Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment A•(/1-5(,{,j 
Committee: Labor and Housing 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -All funds 
Removing the requirement that the compensation of a retired state employee or retired teacher who returns to service 
must be set at 75% of the compensation established for the position to be filled may result in increased costs to the 
State or local school administrative units to fill a position with a retiree versus what it would cost absent this 
legislation if compensation is increased for any employees above 75%. 
Allowing retired state employees and retired teachers to receive compensation greater than 75% when returning to 
work may result in more retirees opting to return to service, resulting in the State and school administrative units 
paying less for certain benefits than would be paid ifreplacement workers had to be hired to fill vacant positions. The 
benefits for returning retired employees are less expensive because they do not accrue additional retirement benefits 
for the time worked after returning to work. To the extent that retirees who return to work are paid higher salaries 
than what would be paid to replacement workers hired to fill a vacant position, any costs from higher wages would be 
partially offset by lower benefit costs.
