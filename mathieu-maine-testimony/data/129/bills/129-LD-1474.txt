Page 1 - 129LR2016(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §2660-A, sub-§2, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 399, §4 and 
3amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended to read:
4E.  Water withdrawn pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Environmental 
5Protection or the Maine Land Use Planning Commission, as long as the permit 
6requires the payment of rates that are just and reasonable, as determined by the 
7Department of Environmental Protection or the Maine Land Use Planning 
8Commission, in order to address negative externalities from the withdrawal with 
9respect to local and regional infrastructure, labor resources and natural resources.  For 
10the purposes of this paragraph, "externalities" means those short-term and long-term 
11effects resulting from the withdrawal or transportation of water that are not accounted 
12for or quantified in the context of water use permitting, licensing or rate setting.
13Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §2660-A, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2007, c. 399, §§5 to 7 and 
14PL 2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended to read:
153.  Appeal.  The commissioner, after consultation with the Public Utilities 
16Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection and the State Geologist, may 
17authorize transport of water for commercial purposes if the commissioner finds that:
18A.    Transport of the water will not constitute a threat to public health, safety or 
19welfare; and
20D.    For a source not otherwise permitted by the Department of Environmental 
21Protection or the Maine Land Use Planning Commission, the water withdrawal will 
22not have an undue adverse effect on waters of the State, as defined by Title 38, 
23section 361-A, subsection 7; water-related natural resources; and existing uses, 
24including, but not limited to, public or private wells, within the anticipated zone of 
25contribution to the withdrawal.  In making findings under this paragraph, the 
26commissioner shall consider both the direct effects of the proposed water withdrawal 
27and, its effects in combination with existing water withdrawals. and the indirect 
28negative externalities and inequity, both local and regional, associated with the water 
29withdrawal.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "externalities" means those short-
30term and long-term effects resulting from the withdrawal or transportation of water 
31that are not accounted for or quantified in the context of water use permitting, 
32licensing or rate setting;
33E.  Water is not available naturally in the location to which the water will be 
34transported; and
35F.  Failure to authorize transport of the water will create a substantial hardship to the 
36potential recipient of the water.
37Any authorization under this subsection is for a period not to exceed 3 years but may be 
38renewed subject to the same criteria.  The department may adopt rules necessary for the 
39implementation of this subsection.  The rules may include imposition of a fee to cover the 
40costs of providing permits, including any impact studies required by the department.  
41Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are major substantive rules as defined in Title 
425, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
Page 2 - 129LR2016(01)-11Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §301, sub-§4, ¶B, as amended by PL 1993, c. 506, §1, is 
2further amended to read:
3B.    Shall, to a level within the commission's discretion, consider whether the utility 
4is operating as efficiently as possible and is utilizing sound management practices, 
5including the treatment in rates of executive compensation, and, for a water utility, is 
6anticipating the negative regional externalities caused by demands for water not 
7related to regional service, such as exportation of water from the regional watershed 
8for profit or the use of a metric by the utility that is not regularly used by water 
9utilities.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "externalities" means those short-term 
10and long-term effects resulting from the withdrawal or transportation of water that are 
11not accounted for or quantified in the context of water use permitting, licensing or 
12rate setting.
13Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §6102-A, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 115, §1, is 
14amended to read:
151.  Rate-adjustment mechanism.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
16contrary, the commission may establish or authorize a reasonable rate-adjustment 
17mechanism to decouple water utility revenues from water utility sales through revenue 
18reconciliation when changes in sales are due to a change in the number of customers or, a 
19change in the volume of consumption, a change in a metric used by the water utility, the 
20addition of a unique use of water, such as exportation from the regional watershed for 
21profit, or unanticipated negative regional externalities. In determining the reasonableness 
22of any such rate-adjustment mechanism, the commission shall apply the standards of 
23section 301 and shall consider the transfer of risks associated with any such changes in 
24sales and, to the extent these risks are transferred between the utility and its customers, 
25the commission shall consider the effect of any inequity in the transfer of risk in 
26determining a utility's allowed rate of return.  For the purposes of this subsection, 
27"externalities" means those short-term and long-term effects resulting from the 
28withdrawal or transportation of water that are not accounted for or quantified in the 
29context of water use permitting, licensing or rate setting.
30Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §6105, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 573, §1, is 
31further amended to read:
322.  Just and reasonable rates.  The governing body shall establish rates, tolls or 
33charges that are just and reasonable and that provide revenue as may be required to 
34perform its public utility service and to attract necessary capital on just and reasonable 
35terms.  In determining just and reasonable rates, the governing body shall evaluate 
36operating efficiency, management practices, the negative regional externalities caused by 
37demands for water not related to regional services and the use of a metric by the utility 
38that is not regularly used by water utilities.  The governing body shall consider the effect 
39of any unique use and ensure to the greatest extent practicable that the risks associated 
40with that use are transferred to that use.  Rates applied to the bulk export of water that, as 
41a result of that export, can no longer provide public health, safety, comfort and 
42convenience to the residents of the district must be approved by the legislative bodies of 
43the municipalities within the watershed from which the water is being removed.  For the 
44purposes of this subsection, "externalities" means those short-term and long-term effects 
Page 3 - 129LR2016(01)-11resulting from the withdrawal or transportation of water that are not accounted for or 
2quantified in the context of water use permitting, licensing or rate setting.  The governing 
3body shall provide the rate schedule and any changes to the rate schedule to the 
4commission.
5Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §6411, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 616, §10, is amended to 
6read:
7§6411.  Standard districts; authorized to make and assume contracts
8A standard district, through its trustees, in order to carry out the purposes of its 
9incorporation, may contract with persons, districts, municipalities, utilities or 
10corporations.  Contracts established for the purpose of exporting bulk water out of the 
11local watershed must be approved by the legislative bodies of all municipalities within 
12the watershed to ensure water is furnished for the public health, safety, comfort and 
13convenience of the residents of the district in accordance with section 6404.
14Sec. 7.  36 MRSA §701-A, first ¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 389, §1, is further 
15amended to read:
16In the assessment of property, assessors in determining just value are to define this 
17term in a manner that recognizes only that value arising from presently possible land use 
18alternatives to which the particular parcel of land being valued may be put. In 
19determining just value, assessors must consider all relevant factors, including without 
20limitation the effect upon value of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the 
21land may be subjected including the effect on value of designation of land as significant 
22wildlife habitat under Title 38, section 480-BB, current use, physical depreciation, sales 
23in the secondary market, any economic benefit or inequity resulting from restrictions to 
24which the use of the land may be subjected regarding large-volume water withdrawal and 
25water withdrawal for bulk transport, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. 
26Restrictions include but are not limited to zoning restrictions limiting the use of land, 
27subdivision restrictions and any recorded contractual provisions limiting the use of lands. 
28The just value of land is determined to arise from and is attributable to legally permissible 
29use or uses only.
30Sec. 8.  38 MRSA §470-H, as amended by PL 2007, c. 235, §1, is further amended 
31to read:
32§470-H.  In-stream flow and water level requirements; rules
33The board shall adopt rules that establish water use requirements for maintaining in-
34stream flows and lake or pond water levels that are protective of aquatic life and other 
35uses and that establish criteria for designating watersheds most at risk from cumulative 
36water use.  Requirements adopted under this section must be based on the natural 
37variation of flows and water levels, allowing variances if use will still be protective of 
38water quality within that classification. The board shall incorporate into the rules a 
39mechanism to reconcile, to the extent feasible, the objective of protecting aquatic life and 
40other uses as provided for in this section and the objective of allowing community water 
41systems to use their existing water supplies to provide water service.  Before the 
Page 4 - 129LR2016(01)-11department issues a community water system withdrawal certificate, the certificate must 
2be reviewed and approved by the drinking water program of the Department of Health 
3and Human Services, with technical assistance from the Public Advocate on economic 
4issues, to ensure that conditions contained in the certificate are economically affordable 
5and technically feasible and, will not jeopardize the safety, dependability or financial 
6viability of the community water system and will not result in inequity from negative 
7regional externalities.  Except as necessary to meet the requirements in this section and 
8rules adopted pursuant to this section, a community water system does not forfeit the 
9rights, powers or responsibilities related to water use that are contained in its legislative 
10charter or similar authority.  Rules adopted under this section are state water use rules in 
11accordance with the authority reserved to states under the federal Clean Water Act.  A 
12water user that fails to comply with the requirements of the rules adopted under this 
13section is subject to penalties pursuant to section 349.  For purposes of this section, 
14"community water system" has the same meaning as in Title 22, section 2660-B, 
15subsection 2. Rules adopted under this section are major substantive rules as defined in 
16Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  For the purposes of this section, "externalities" 
17means those short-term and long-term effects resulting from the withdrawal or 
18transportation of water that are not accounted for or quantified in the context of water use 
19permitting, licensing or rate setting.
20SUMMARY
21This bill requires certain governmental entities when issuing permits or licenses and 
22setting rates to evaluate the negative externalities resulting from unique uses of water, 
23such as the bulk exportation of water out of a region.
