Page 1 - 129LR1112(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3762, sub-§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2017, c. 256, §1; c. 284, 
3Pt. NNNNNNN, §10; c. 290, §1; and c. 412, §2, is further amended to read:
4B.  The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in 
5accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 
6this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 
7families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance for families described in this 
8subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:
9(1)  To continue the pass-through of the first $50 per month of current child 
10support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass-through from the budget 
11tests and benefit calculations;
12(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 
13States who are receiving assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  
14Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of 
15noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 
16aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 
17noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 
18assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  
19July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household 
20remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 
21for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 
22receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 
23on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 
24through a state-funded program unless that noncitizen is:
25(a)  Elderly or disabled, as described under the laws governing supplemental 
26security income in 42 United States Code, Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);
27(b)  A victim of domestic violence; 
28(c)  Experiencing other hardship, such as time necessary to obtain proper 
29work documentation, as defined by the department by rule. Rules adopted by 
30the department under this division are routine technical rules as defined by 
31Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A; or
32(d)  Unemployed but has obtained proper work documentation, as defined by 
33the department by rule.  Rules adopted by the department under this division 
34are routine technical rules as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A;
35(3) To provide benefits to 2-parent families with children using the same 
36eligibility requirements as apply to families headed by a single custodial parent or 
37caretaker relative;
38(4)  To provide an assistance program for needy children, 19 to 21 years of age, 
39who are in full-time attendance in secondary school.  The program is operated for 
40those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United States Social Security 
41Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the 
42parent or caretaker relative of those individuals.  Except for the age requirement, 
Page 2 - 129LR1112(01)-11all provisions of TANF, including the standard of need and the amount of 
2assistance, apply to the program established pursuant to this subparagraph;
3(5)  To provide assistance for a pregnant woman who is otherwise eligible for 
4assistance under this chapter, except that she has no dependents under 19 years of 
5age.  An individual is eligible for the monthly benefit for one eligible person if 
6the medically substantiated expected date of the birth of her child is not more 
7than 90 days following the date the benefit is received;
8(6)  To provide a special housing allowance for TANF families whose shelter 
9expenses for rent, mortgage or similar payments, homeowners insurance and 
10property taxes equal or exceed 50% of their monthly income.  The special 
11housing allowance is limited to $300 per month for each family.  For purposes of 
12this subparagraph, "monthly income" means the total of the TANF monthly 
13benefit and all income countable under the TANF program, plus child support 
14received by the family, excluding the $50 pass-through payment;
15(7)  In determining benefit levels for TANF recipients who have earnings from 
16employment, the department shall disregard from monthly earnings the 
17following:
18(a)  One hundred and eight dollars;
19(b)  Fifty percent of the remaining earnings that are less than the federal 
20poverty level; and
21(c)  All actual child care costs necessary for work, except that the department 
22may limit the child care disregard to $175 per month per child or $200 per 
23month per child under 2 years of age or with special needs;
24(7-A)  In determining eligibility and benefit levels, the department may apply a 
25gross income test only to applicants and not to recipients;

27employment, the department shall disregard from monthly earnings the 
28following:

Page 3 - 129LR1112(01)-11(b)  Seventy-five percent of all earned income beginning in the 7th month of 
2employment during a period of continuous receipt of assistance that is not 
3interrupted by a break in assistance of more than 2 months;
4(c)  One hundred and eight dollars and 50% of the remaining earnings that 
5are less than the federal poverty level beginning in the 13th month of 
6employment during a period of continuous receipt of assistance that is not 
7interrupted by a break in assistance of more than 2 months; 
8(d)  In the event of a break in assistance of more than 2 months, for any new 
9period of assistance, $108 and 50% of the remaining earnings; and
10(e)  All actual child care costs necessary for work, except that the department 
11may limit the child care disregard to $175 per month per child or $200 per 
12month per child under 2 years of age or with special needs;
13(7-E)  For any period during which a household's food supplement assistance is 
14reduced as a result of earnings and receipt of the earned income disregard applied 
15under subparagraph (7-D), division (a) or (b), the household must receive 
16additional food supplement assistance in an amount that will, in addition to the 
17food supplement assistance for which the household remains eligible, provide the 
18household with the same amount of food supplement assistance as it received in 
19the month immediately preceding the month in which it received the enhanced 
20earned income disregard.  Additional food supplement assistance under this 
21subparagraph is a noncash benefit and may be used to purchase only those food 
22items permitted under the food supplement program. These funds must be 
23provided under the TANF block grant available under Title IV-A of the United 
24States Social Security Act;
25(8)  In cases when the TANF recipient has no child care cost, the monthly TANF 
26benefit is the maximum payment level or the difference between the countable 
27earnings and the standard of need established by rule adopted by the department, 
28whichever is lower;
29(9)  In cases when the TANF recipient has child care costs, the department shall 
30determine a total benefit package, including TANF cash assistance, determined in 
31accordance with subparagraph (7) (7-D) and additional child care assistance, as 
32provided by rule, necessary to cover the TANF recipient's actual child care costs 
33up to the maximum amount specified in section 3782-A, subsection 5, paragraph 
34B.  The benefit amount must be paid as provided in this subparagraph.
35(a)  Before the first month in which child care assistance is available to an 
36ASPIRE-TANF recipient under this paragraph and periodically thereafter, the 
37department shall notify the recipient of the total benefit package and the 
38following options of the recipient: to receive the total benefit package 
39directly; or to have the department pay the recipient's child care assistance 
40directly to the designated child care provider for the recipient and pay the 
41balance of the total benefit package to the recipient.
42(b)  If an ASPIRE-TANF recipient notifies the department that the recipient 
43chooses to receive the child care assistance directly, the department shall pay 
44the total benefit package to the recipient.
Page 4 - 129LR1112(01)-11(c)  If an ASPIRE-TANF recipient does not respond or notifies the 
2department of the choice to have the child care assistance paid directly to the 
3child care provider from the total benefit package, the department shall pay 
4the child care assistance directly to the designated child care provider for the 
5recipient.  The department shall pay the balance of the total benefit package 
6to the recipient;

11implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subparagraph are
