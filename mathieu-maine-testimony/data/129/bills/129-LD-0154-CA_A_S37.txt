The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $128,684 in fiscal 
year 2019-20 and $257,367 in fiscal year 2020-21 to allow for all chiropractic services that are within the scope of 
practice of chiropractic doctors and performed by a licensed chiropractic doctor to be reimbursed under the 
MaineCare program. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for the FMAP match. 
There is a potential for savings which could mitigate the new costs above from individuals currently receiving 
services in a higher cost setting who may choose to receive services from a lower cost chiropractor and savings from 
individuals who choose the chiropractic setting initially for a new service. As it is not known how often this may 
occur no estimate of the potential savings is made at this time.
