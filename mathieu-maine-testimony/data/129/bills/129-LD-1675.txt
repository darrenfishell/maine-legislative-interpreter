30SUMMARY
31This bill amends laws relating to the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.
321.  It provides that beginning July 1, 2020, the Maine Uniform Building and Energy 
33Code must be enforced in all municipalities regardless of population.
342.  It exempts a house constructed and occupied prior to January 1, 2007 or any 
35modification of or addition to a house constructed and occupied prior to January 1, 2007 
36other than a complete demolition and rebuilding of the house from the requirements of 
37the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.  A municipality is prohibited from 
38requiring architectural plans to be filed for such a modification or addition.
Page 4 - 129LR0200(01)-113.  It removes the option for municipalities to use 3rd-party inspectors contracted and 
2paid for by building owners and requires municipalities that use 3rd-party inspectors to 
3contract directly with these inspectors and to select them through a competitive bidding 
4process.  It allows 3rd-party inspectors to jointly bid on a competitive solicitation by a 
5municipality.
