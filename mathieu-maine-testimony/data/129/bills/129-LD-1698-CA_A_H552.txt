The bill provides an income tax credit for the production of renewable chemicals by the conversion of renewable 
biomass from the forest, farms, the sea or solid waste and would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of 
$15 ,200 in fiscal year 2021-22. It would also result in a reduction in Local Government Fund revenue of $800 in 
fiscal year 2021-22. 
Depending on the number of companies that take advantage of the income tax credit, the Department of Economic and 
Community Development may require additional staff to implement the requirements associated with the tiered tax 
credit. If necessary, the department will submit the request for a position to the 129th Legislature during the second 
regular session.
