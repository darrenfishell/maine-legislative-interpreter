129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 1033, L.D. 1420, "Resolve, To 
Establish a Task Force To Study the Current Status and Future Sustainability of 
Aquaculture in the State" 
Amend the resolve by striking out all of section 6 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 6. Staff assistance. Resolved: That, notwithstanding Joint Rule 353, the 
Legislative Council shall provide staffing assistance to the task force, except that 
Legislative Council staff support is not authorized when the Legislature is in regular or 
special session.' 
Amend the resolve in section 7 by striking out all of the last sentence (page 3, lines 9 
to 11 in L.D.) 
Amend the resolve by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. ·· 
SUMMARY 
This amendment specifies that the Legislative Council is required to provide staffing 
assistance to the task force instead of requiring that the Department of Marine Resources 
and the Department of Environmental Protection provide the assistance as in the resolve. 
It also removes the requirement that the Department of Marine Resources and the 
Department of Environmental Protection post the interim and final reports on their 
publicly accessible websites.

Legislative Cost/Study 
Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $2,250 in fiscal year 2019-20. An estimated $6,190 
is available in each of fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21 in the Legislature's proposed budget for legislative studies as 
well as any balances from prior years for this purpose. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will 
depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. The additional costs of 
providing staffing assistance to the study during the interim can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted staff 
resources. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Department of Economic and Community Development, the Department of Marine 
Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection and the University of Maine System to serve on the task 
force can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
