Page 1 - 129LR0600(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1551, sub-§1-E is enacted to read:
31-E.  Electronic age verification device.  "Electronic age verification device" means 
4an electronic device that is capable of scanning a person's motor vehicle operator's license 
5or identification card described in section 1555-A to verify the person's age at the time of 
6a retail sale of a tobacco product.
7Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §1555-B, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 308, §6, is 
8further amended to read:
92.  Sales to persons who have not attained 21 years of age prohibited.  A person 
10may not sell, furnish, give away or offer to sell, furnish or give away a tobacco product to 
11any person who has not attained 21 years of age, unless the person has attained 18 years 
12of age as of July 1, 2018.  Tobacco products may not be sold at retail to any person who 
13has not attained 30 years of age unless the seller first verifies that person's age by means 
14of reliable photographic identification containing the person's date of birth.  That a person 
15appeared to be 30 years of age or older does not constitute a defense to a violation of this 
16section.  Notwithstanding subsection 8, paragraph A-1, an employer who has an 
17electronic age verification device is not considered to have violated this subsection when 
18a person employed by the employer fails to use the electronic age verification device to 
19verify a person's age at the time of the retail sale and sells a tobacco product to a person 
20who has not attained 21 years of age.
21SUMMARY
22This bill provides that an employer who sells tobacco products and who has an 
23electronic age verification device is not subject to a civil violation if a person employed 
24by the employer does not use the electronic age verification device to verify a person's 
25age for the sale of tobacco products and sells a tobacco product to a person who has not 
26attained 21 years of age.
