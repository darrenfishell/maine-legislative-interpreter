4This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5This bill proposes to create a paid internship program in the Department of Inland 
6Fisheries and Wildlife in order to provide beginning wildlife biologists with a diversity of 
7opportunities to increase their experience and make them more versatile and more likely 
8to pursue careers in the State.
9The program must:
101.  Employ a competitive process to choose interns;
112.  Offer a paid internship to each chosen participant for a period of no less than 2 
12years;
133.  Include various fields of study in incremental blocks over the course of the 
14internship; and
154.  Be offered to no fewer than 3 interns per year.
16It is intended that funding for this program would come, in part, from the 
17consolidation of seasonal and other part-time positions in the Department of Inland 
18Fisheries and Wildlife the duties of which can be performed by interns participating in the 
19program.
