24in Title 7, section 81 and that:
25A.  If the population of the region is 300,000 or more, based on the 1990 U.S. 
26Census, conducted racing on more than 69 days in each of the previous 2 calendar 
27years, except that if a racetrack that qualifies as a commercial track under this 
28paragraph ceases operation, a separate racetrack operated by the owner or operator of 
29the racetrack that ceased operation qualifies as a commercial track, and for all 
30purposes is considered the same commercial track as the track that ceased operation, 
31if the population of the region of that separate racetrack is 300,000 or more, based on 
32the 1990 U.S. Census, and the sum of the number of days on which racing was 
33conducted at the track that ceased operation and the number of days on which racing 
34was conducted at the separate racetrack equals at least 70 days in each of the 2 
35preceding calendar years year after the track was initially licensed as a commercial 
36track, unless a lesser number of days of racing was conducted in a year due to 
37conditions beyond the control of the racetrack owner or operator as approved by the 
38commission; or

40Census, conducted racing on more than 34 days in each of the previous 2 calendar

7preceding calendar years; year after the track was initially licensed as a commercial

12more, based on the 1990 U.S. Census, to replace a commercial track as defined by 
13paragraph A that ceased operation after January 1, 2014 and for which no separate 
14racetrack has been opened by the owner or operator of that commercial track that 
15ceased operation.  For purposes of this paragraph, a racetrack is not required to have 
16conducted racing during the 2 preceding calendar years but is required to conduct 
17racing on at least 70 days during each calendar year after the track is initially licensed 
18as a commercial track.  If a commercial track under this paragraph has not been 
19granted 70 race days by the commission for the initial calendar year of operation, race 
20days conducted during that year by the commercial track that ceased operation after 
21January 1, 2014 are credited to the replacement commercial track; or

25racetrack has been opened by the owner or operator of that commercial track that 
26ceased operation.  For purposes of this paragraph, a racetrack is not required to have 
27conducted racing during the 2 preceding calendar years but is required to conduct 
28racing on at least 35 days during each calendar year after the track is initially licensed 
29as a commercial track.  If a commercial track under this paragraph has not been 
30granted 35 race days by the commission for the initial calendar year of operation, race 
31days conducted during that year by the commercial track that ceased operation after 
32January 1, 2014 are credited to the replacement commercial track.
33For the purposes of this subsection, "region" is determined by measuring a distance of 50 
34miles from the center of the racing track along the most commonly used roadway, as 
35determined by the Department of Transportation, drawing a circle around the center of 
36the racing track using that 50-mile measurement and excluding those municipalities or 
37unorganized territories that do not have boundaries contained entirely by that circle.
38For the purpose of determining the number of days a race track conducted racing under 
39this subsection, if a race day is canceled due to a natural or other disaster, or due to a 
40horse supply shortage as verified by the state steward, the track is considered to have 
41conducted racing on that day.
42Sec. 7.  8 MRSA §275-C, sub-§4 is enacted to read:

30shall reject the application.  If the commission does not receive an objection within that 
31period, the commission may proceed to consider the application.  For purposes of this 
32subsection, the market area is determined by measuring a distance of 35 15 miles from 
33the off-track betting facility along the most commonly used roadway adjacent to the off-
34track betting facility, as determined by the Department of Transportation, drawing a circle 
35around the center of the off-track betting facility using that 35-mile 15-mile

4commercial track, as defined in section 275-A, subsection 1, to each agricultural fair

29as "the fund," is established to be used solely for the marketing and promotion of harness 
30racing in the State.  The fund consists of any money received through the commission on 
31wagers pursuant to section 286 and any contributions, grants or appropriations from 
32private and public sources.  The fund, to be accounted for within the commission, must be 
33held separate and apart from all other money, funds and accounts.  Any balance 
34remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year does not lapse but must be carried 
35forward to the next fiscal year.  The fund may not be charged for indirect costs under a 
36departmental indirect cost allocation plan.
37SUMMARY
38This bill amends the harness racing laws in the following ways.
391.  It requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to develop a 
40biennial operating budget for the State Harness Racing Commission with input from the 
41commission that allows for expenditures for discretionary activities by the commission 
Page 9 - 129LR1279(01)-11during the biennium if the commission determines the activities are in the best interest of 
2the harness racing industry.
32.  It protects the Harness Racing Promotional Fund from being charged for indirect 
4costs under a departmental indirect cost allocation plan.
53.  It requires a harness racing license application of a pari-mutuel betting licensee 
6who leases a racing plant to list financial and corporate information of the owner of the 
7real estate.
84.  It requires the commission, when assigning race dates to licensees, to consider the 
9development of revenues from interstate simulcasting, the ability to offer night racing and 
10the ability to maintain ownership of or a leasehold on facilities.
115.  It changes the definition of "commercial track" for regions with a population of 
12300,000 or more and with a population of less than 300,000 by removing language for 
13racetracks that have ceased operations.
146.  It provides that an off-track betting facility within a 50-mile radius of a 
15commercial track must pay 1% of the wagers made during the time live racing is being 
16conducted on race day and 0.5% of the wagers made during the time that live racing is 
17not being conducted on race day.
187.  It allows an off-track betting facility to be located within a facility licensed to 
19serve alcohol that is owned by an owner other than the off-track betting facility owner.
208.  It removes the requirement that an applicant for an off-track betting license notify 
21commercial tracks within 50 miles of the proposed off-track betting facility.
229.  It provides that an applicant for an off-track betting license must notify and allow 
23objections from existing off-track betting facilities within 15 miles of the proposed off-
24track betting facility, instead of within 35 miles as in current law.
2510.  It changes the date of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's 
26annual report to the Legislature on off-track betting from January 1st to March 1st.
2711.  It provides for reduced payments from revenues derived by an off-track betting 
28facility first licensed after January 1, 2019 that is owned by a federally recognized Indian 
29tribe and is located and operated in an establishment licensed to serve alcohol.
3012.  It allows an agricultural fair licensee to qualify for funds from the fund to 
31supplement harness racing purses by conducting an extended meet, removing the 
32requirement that the licensee must have conducted an extended meet in 2005.
