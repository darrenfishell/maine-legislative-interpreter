2Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง4303, sub-ยง22, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 232, ยง7, is 
3amended to read:
422.  Denial of referral by out-of-network provider prohibited.  Beginning January 
51, 2018, a carrier may not deny payment for any health care service covered under an 
6enrollee's health plan based solely on the basis that the enrollee's referral was made by a 
7direct primary care provider who is not a member of the carrier's provider network.  A 
8carrier may require a direct primary care provider making a referral who is not a member 
9of the carrier's provider network to meet appropriate credentialing standards consistent 
10with other primary care providers participating in the carrier's provider network.  As used 
11in this subsection, "direct primary care provider" has the same meaning as in Title 22, 
12section 1771, subsection 1, paragraph B.
13SUMMARY
14This bill provides that the law that prohibits carriers from denying payment for 
15covered health care services solely on the basis that the referral for services was made by 
16an out-of-network provider applies only to referrals made by out-of-network direct 
17primary care providers.  It also allows a carrier to require a direct primary care provider 
18who is not a member of the carrier's provider network and who makes a referral to meet 
19appropriate credentialing standards consistent with other primary care providers 
20participating in the carrier's provider network.
