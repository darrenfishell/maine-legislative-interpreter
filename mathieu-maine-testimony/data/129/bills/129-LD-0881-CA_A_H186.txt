antlerless deer permit under certain conditions and the opportunity to enter a bonus

Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
This bill clarifies that the purchase of a super pack license includes one antlerless deer permit to be issued under 
certain conditions and the opportunity to enter a bonus antlerless-only deer permit lottery for one additional permit. 
The bill also allows a super pack licensee one additional entry into the bonus antlerless-only deer permit lottery if 
certain conditions prevent the issuance of the antlerless deer permit included in the super pack license. This bill will 
not change the total bag limit of two deer or the total number of licenses issued statewide. Any additional costs to the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as a result of these changes are anticipated to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
