8programs and services focused on public and behavioral health, to be funded through the 
9Adult Use Marijuana Public Health and Safety Fund established under the Maine Revised 
10Statutes, Title 28-B, section 1101.  It also clarifies the scope of enhanced training for 
11criminal justice agencies to be implemented or facilitated by the department by making 
12eligible for that training municipal officials and employees and by including within that 
13scope training regarding restorative justice, jail diversion, marijuana industry-specific
