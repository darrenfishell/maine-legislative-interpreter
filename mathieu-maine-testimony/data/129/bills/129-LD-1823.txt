Page 1 - 129LR2384(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง436-A, sub-ยง3-A is enacted to read:
33-A.  Float haul-out or marine way.  "Float haul-out" or "marine way" means a 
4structure that is a functionally water-dependent use for the sole purpose of storing a float 
5during the off season. It consists of 2 parallel runners extending from below the normal 
6high-water line toward the upland from the water body. Unlike a pier, dock or wharf, the 
7structure is not decked over, does not have handrails, is low to the ground and is built on 
8an angle. It is not designed to be walked on, to pull a boat up to or to swim off of, and it 
9offers no other functional use.
10Sec. 2.  38 MRSA ยง439-A, sub-ยง4-D is enacted to read:
114-D.  Exemption from setback requirements for float haul-out or marine way. A 
12float haul-out or marine way is a functionally water-dependent use for purposes of this 
13subchapter. The requirements of section 480-C may still apply.
14SUMMARY
15This bill provides that a float haul-out or marine way is a functionally water-
16dependent use allowed in the shoreland zone.
