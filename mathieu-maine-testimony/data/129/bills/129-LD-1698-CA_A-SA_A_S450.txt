This amendment changes the criteria of eligibility for the tax credit by eliminating the requirement that 75% of 
employees of contractors meet certain eligibility conditions and instead requiring contractors to be 3rd-party ce11ified 
by the Northeast Master Logger program. This amendment retains the delay of the application date one year from on 
or after January 1, 2020 to on or after January 1, 2021. This completely restores the revenue loss in fiscal year 2021-
22. It is anticipated that more contractors would qualify for the tax credit. Th.is would increase the revenue loss 
already in the bill by an estimated $10,575 in fiscal year 2022-23. The revenue loss in the Local Government Fund 
would also increase by small amounts.
