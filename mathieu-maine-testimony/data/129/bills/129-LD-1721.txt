26SUMMARY
27This bill specifies that appointees to the Commission on Governmental Ethics and 
28Election Practices who fill an unexpired term on the commission for less than 2 years are 
29eligible to be appointed to 2 consecutive full terms thereafter.
30It makes a number of changes to the campaign reports and finances laws, including:
311.  Conforming the schedule for certain communications made before an election that 
32name or depict a clearly identified candidate, and which must state the name and address 
33of the person who made or financed the communication and include a statement whether 
34the communication was authorized by the candidate, to the schedule for similar 
35communications financed by independent expenditures, the schedule being for 
36communications disseminated during the 28 days, including election day, before a 
37primary election, during the 35 days, including election day, before a special election or 
38during the period of time from Labor Day to the general election day for a general 
39election.  It conforms the schedule for prerecorded automated telephone calls and scripted 
40live telephone communications that name a clearly identified candidate to this schedule 
41and requires the communication to indicate whether the communication was authorized 
Page 15 - 129LR1093(01)-11by the candidate.  It exempts telephone surveys that are not conducted to change the 
2voting position of a call recipient from making disclosures under the provision.  It 
3requires prerecorded automated telephone calls or scripted live telephone calls to clearly 
4and conspicuously state the name of the person who made or financed the expenditure for 
5the communication but excludes telephone surveys from this requirement;
62.  Amending the laws regarding reporting by candidates for the office of Governor 
7or for state or county office other than Governor to exempt a candidate without an 
8opponent who is on the ballot or is a write-in candidate from having to make a report 
9from 14 days to one day before the election of a single contribution of $1,000 or more 
10within 24 hours of receiving the contribution.  It also requires the address of each payee 
11and creditor to be included on a report made by a candidate;
123.  Amending the laws governing reports of contributions and expenditures by party 
13committees, political action committees and ballot question committees in the provisions 
14governing reports made 11 days before elections and 42 days after elections to limit these 
15reports to a year with a primary and a general election, unless in another year without 
16these elections a state party committee has received contributions or made expenditures 
17related to a ballot question election, a special election or a municipal candidate or 
18referendum election, in which case the state party committee must file these reports.  It 
19limits to only those state party committees that are required to file a report 11 days before 
20an election the application of the law requiring a state party committee to report any 
21single contribution of $5,000 or more or any single expenditure of $1,000 or more made 
22after the 14th day before the election and more than 24 hours before 5:00 p.m. on the day 
23of the election within 24 hours of that contribution or expenditure.  It limits to only 
24general elections the application of the law requiring municipal, district and county party 
25committees to report any single contribution of $5,000 or more received or any 
26expenditure of $1,000 or more made after the 14th day before any election and more than 
2724 hours before 11:59 p.m. on the day of the election within 24 hours of that contribution 
28or expenditure; and
294.  Amending the laws regarding reports by political action committees to make those 
30laws apply to ballot question committees and to make a violation of the provision 
31regarding political communications to influence a ballot question, which other than for 
32telephone calls requires the name and address of the person who made or financed the 
33expenditure for the communication to be clearly and conspicuously stated, punishable by 
34a penalty of no more than $5,000.  It exempts from the reporting laws regarding ballot 
35question committees a person whose only payments of money for the purpose of 
36influencing a campaign in this State are contributions to political action committees or 
37ballot question committees and who has not raised or accepted any contributions for the 
38purpose of influencing a campaign in this State.
39It also makes changes to the Maine Clean Election Act in the provisions regarding 
40terms of participation, including:
411.  Requiring a contributor making a qualifying contribution by check or money order 
42to sign the check or money order and allowing the candidate to remedy an error on the 
43check or money order by endorsing the check or money order to the Maine Clean 
44Election Fund.  It allows a contributor to make a qualifying contribution to a participating 
Page 16 - 129LR1093(01)-11candidate in the form of cash as long as the contributor signs a form affirming the 
2contribution was made with personal funds.  It also allows a contributor to make a 
3qualifying contribution with cash as long as the candidate submits a money order in the 
4same amount to the commission.  It specifies that if a participating candidate uses 
5personal funds to pay fees for the purchase of a cashier's check or money order, those fees 
6are not a contribution to the candidate and are not required to be disclosed in campaign 
7finance reports and that the candidate must report any cashier's check or money order fees 
8paid by anyone other than the candidate as an in-kind contribution subject to seed money 
9limitations.  It specifies that a payment, gift or anything of value may not be given in 
10exchange for a qualifying contribution;
112.  Specifying that a candidate must meet the qualifications for candidacy and for 
12holding office, including residency requirements provided in the Constitution of Maine, 
13and that the commission may consider a request to investigate a candidate's qualifications 
14at any point prior to 6 months after the election for which the candidate received funding.  
15It also provides that failure to meet the qualifications is grounds for revocation of 
16certification under the Maine Clean Election Act; and
173.  Prohibiting a candidate's using Maine Clean Election Fund revenues to pay or 
18compensate, for campaign-related goods or services, the candidate or the candidate's 
19spouse or domestic partner, a sole proprietorship of the candidate or the candidate's 
20spouse or domestic partner, a business entity in which the candidate or the candidate's 
21spouse or domestic partner holds a significant proprietary or financial interest or a 
22nonprofit entity in which the candidate or the candidate's spouse or domestic partner is a 
23director, officer, executive director or chief financial officer.  It allows a candidate to 
24make expenditures using fund revenues to pay a member of the candidate's immediate 
25family or household, other than the candidate's spouse or domestic partner, a business 
26entity in which a member of the candidate's immediate family or household, other than 
27the candidate's spouse or domestic partner, holds a significant interest or a nonprofit 
28entity in which a member of the candidate's immediate family or household, other than 
29the candidate's spouse or domestic partner, is a director, officer, executive director or 
30chief financial officer, as long as the expenditure is for a legitimate campaign-related 
31purpose, to an individual or business engaged in the normal course of business and in a 
32reasonable amount.
