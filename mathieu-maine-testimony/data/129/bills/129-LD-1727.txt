11SUMMARY
12This bill makes corrections to various statutory provisions related to the Department 
13of Corrections.
14Sections 1 and 2 amend the part of the Maine Juvenile Code having to do with 
15authorized places of detention for juveniles that, due to an oversight, was not amended

17at the Mountain View Correctional Facility.
18Section 3 amends a statutory provision having to do with the collection of restitution 
19from former Department of Corrections clients to recognize that the time and method of 
20payment of restitution are, in some cases, determined by the sentencing court and not the 
21department.
22Section 4 removes an inapposite reference from a statutory provision authorizing 
23rules for work release, furlough and other rehabilitative programs.
24Section 5 corrects a grammatical error in a statutory provision relating to supervised 
25community confinement.
