20 SUMMARY 
21 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, makes several 
22 technical changes to the bill and clarifies that the Secretary of State has discretion to 
23 determine whether ranked-choice contests should appear on the same ballot page as or on 
24 a different ballot page from contests that are not subject to ranked-choice voting. The 
25 amendment also clarifies that a voter's decision to rank more than one candidate for a 
26 single office does not render the voter's vote invalid in an election determined by ranked-
27 choice voting. The amendment further requires that an election official post a paper copy 
28 of the results of the first choice votes cast in elections determined by ranked-choice 
29 voting, if a secure place is available at the voting place or municipal office where the 
30 public may view the election results.
