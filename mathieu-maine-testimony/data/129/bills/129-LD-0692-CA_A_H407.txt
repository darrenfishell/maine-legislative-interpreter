COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 'A" to H.P. 512, L.D. 692 
1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment specifies that the services provided by independent licensed clinical 
3 social workers are provided under Section 65 of rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits 
4 Manual, Chapter III. Rather than increasing rates to the lowest reimbursement rate for 
5 the same service paid by an insurance carrier licensed in Maine, the amendment increases 
6 rates to 70% of the Medicare rate for the closest equivalent service, since there is no exact 
7 equivalent rate under Medicare. The amendment also adds an appropriations ·and 
8 allocations section.

The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $284,870 in fiscal 
year 2019-20 and $569,740 in fiscal year 2020-21 for an increase to rates in rnle Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits 
Manual, Section 65 Behavioral Health Services, Chapter III to increase reimbursement rates for counseling services 
provided by independent licensed clinical social workers. 
PL 2017 c. 460 increased rates for services in Sections 17, 23 and 65 which are included in the Clinic Upper Payment 
Limit calculations. The impact of those increases put the department at or slightly above the amount allowed to be 
paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result, the rate increase in this bill would have to be 
paid with state general fund money only.
