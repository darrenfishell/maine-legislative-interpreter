7examination report by the insurance regulatory authority of the insurance company's state 
8of domicile or port-of-entry state for any foreign or alien insurer licensed in this State in 
9lieu of an examination by the superintendent if, at the time of the examination, that 
10regulatory authority was accredited under the National Association of Insurance 
11Commissioners' Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program or if the 
12examination was performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance regulatory 
13authority or with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by an 
14accredited insurance regulatory authority and who, after a review of the examination 
15workpapers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner 
16consistent with the standards and procedures required by the regulatory authority.
17Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§7, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
18§14 and affected by §34, is further amended to read:
19A.  The superintendent shall hold a hearing in accordance with the procedures set 
20forth in section 231 and the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, Title 5, chapter 
21375, subchapter 4, within 30 days after the application required by subsection 4-C has 
22been filed with the superintendent.  The superintendent shall make a determination 
23within 30 days after the conclusion of that hearing.  The superintendent shall approve 
24any purchase, exchange, merger or other change of control referred to in subsection 
254-C unless the superintendent finds that:
26(1)  After the change of control, the domestic insurer could not satisfy the 
27requirements for the issuance of a certificate of authority according to 
28requirements in force at the time of the issuance or last renewal or continuation of 
29its certificate of authority to do the insurance business that it intends to transact in 
30this State;
31(2)  The effect of the purchases, exchanges, merger of a controlling person of the 
32insurer or other changes of control may be substantially to lessen competition in 
33insurance in this State or tend to create a monopoly in this State or would violate 
34the laws of this State or of the United States relating to monopolies or restraints 
35of trade;
36(3)  The financial condition of an acquiring person would jeopardize the financial 
37stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;

39the insurer, to sell its assets or to merge it with any person, or to make any other 
40major change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair or 
41prejudicial to policyholders;
Page 2 - 129LR3020(01)-11(5)  The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would 
2control the operation of the insurer indicate that it would not be in the interest of 
3policyholders or the public to permit them to do so;
4(6)  Any merger of a domestic insurer does not comply with section 3474; or
5(7)  The change of control would tend to affect adversely the contractual 
6obligations of the domestic insurer or its ability and tendency to render service in 
7the future to its policyholders and the public.
8Sec. 4.  24-A MRSA §222, sub-§7-A, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 238, Pt. A, 
9§15 and affected by §34, is amended by amending subparagraph (3) to read:
10(3)  The proceeding is public to the same extent as a proceeding conducted under 
11subsection 7, except that deliberations of a decision-making panel are not public

13panel members and their advisers, other than the decision itself, are not public 
14records.

23must be conducted for each insurer within the insurance holding company 
24system, either on a systemwide basis or separately for insurers or combinations of 
25insurers within the insurance holding company system.
26(4)  An insurer subject to this paragraph shall maintain a risk management 
27framework to assist the insurer with identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing 
28and reporting on its material and relevant risks.  An insurer may satisfy this 
29requirement by participating in an applicable risk management framework 
30maintained by the insurance holding company system of which the insurer is a 
31member.
32(5)  An insurer subject to this paragraph shall prepare and submit regular ORSA 
33summary reports that satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph and shall

9applies the enterprise risk management process described in the ORSA 
10summary report and that a copy of the report has been provided to the 
11insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee of the board.

16commissioner of another state or to an insurance supervisor or regulator of a 
17foreign jurisdiction if that report provides information that is comparable to 
18the information described in the ORSA guidance manual.  Any report in a 
19language other than English must be accompanied by an English translation.

24Sec. 6.  24-A MRSA §731-B, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 169, Pt. C, §1, 
25is further amended to read:

27with subsection 3, credit for reinsurance is allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an 
28asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the 
29reinsurance is ceded to a solvent assuming insurer that:

31assuming insurer maintains surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less 
32than the sum of paid-in capital stock, if any, and surplus as otherwise required for a 
33certificate of authority for the kinds and amount of insurance and assumed 
34reinsurance the insurer has in force net of any applicable ceded reinsurance.  If the 
35assuming insurer is licensed as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle pursuant to 
36section 782 and maintains capital and surplus in accordance with the requirements of 
37section 787, credit for reinsurance under a special purpose reinsurance vehicle 
38contract, as defined in section 781, subsection 15, is allowed only to the extent that:
39(1)  The fair value of the assets held by or for the benefit of the ceding insurer 
40equals or exceeds the obligations due and payable to the ceding insurer by the 
41special purpose reinsurance vehicle under the special purpose reinsurance vehicle

9(2)  Except where reinsurance is ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling 
10arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system, maintains a 
11surplus regarding policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000;
12B-1.  Is accredited as a reinsurer in this State, in accordance with the following 
13standards.
14(1) To apply for accreditation, a reinsurer shall file with the superintendent a 
15written application on a form prescribed by the superintendent, accompanied by 
16the fee prescribed in section 601, subsection 26 and an agreement to submit to the 
17jurisdiction of the courts of this State and to the authority of the superintendent to 
18examine the reinsurer's books and records.
19(2) An accredited reinsurer must be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance 
20in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien reinsurer,

23(3) An accredited reinsurer shall file with the superintendent, as part of its 
24application and annually thereafter, a copy of its annual statement filed with the 
25insurance department of its state of domicile or United States port of entry and a 
26copy of its most recent audited financial statement.
27(4) A reinsurer applying for accreditation that maintains a surplus as regards to 
28policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000 is deemed to be accredited 
29if the reinsurer's application is not denied by the superintendent within 90 days 
30after submission of the application.  The superintendent has the discretion to 
31grant accreditation to an applicant with a surplus less than $20,000,000 subject to 
32such terms and conditions as the superintendent determines to be necessary and 
33appropriate for the protection of domestic ceding insurers and their 
34policyholders.;

9provided for authorized insurers under section 421 and agree to provide 
10security for 100% of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to 
11reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if the assuming insurer 
12resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;
13(e)  The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing 
14requirements as determined by the superintendent, both with respect to an 
15initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis.  Documents filed 
16with the superintendent by the assuming insurer are not public records if the 
17documents are confidential under the laws of the assuming insurer's 
18domiciliary jurisdiction;
19(f)  The assuming insurer must pay the application fee prescribed in section 
20601, subsection 26-A and, to the extent provided in rules adopted under 
21subsection 7, must agree to pay reasonable costs of review; and
22(g)  The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for 
23certification established by the superintendent.
24(2)  An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated 
25underwriters may be a certified reinsurer.  In order to be eligible for certification, 
26in addition to satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1):
27(a)  The association may satisfy its minimum capital and surplus 
28requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of 
29the association and its members, which must include a joint central fund that 
30may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its 
31members, in an amount determined by the superintendent to provide adequate 
32protection;
33(b)  The incorporated members of the association may not be engaged in any 
34business other than underwriting as a member of the association and must be 
35subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the 
36association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and
37(c)  Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the 
38association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the 
39superintendent an annual certification by the association's domiciliary 
40regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member of the association or, if 
41a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent 
42public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.
Page 7 - 129LR3020(01)-11(3)  The superintendent shall create and publish a list of jurisdictions that are 
2qualified to serve as the domiciliary regulators of certified reinsurers.
3(a)  In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of an alien 
4assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the 
5superintendent shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
6reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an 
7ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal 
8recognition afforded by the jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled 
9in the United States.  To be recognized as qualified, a jurisdiction must agree 
10to share information and cooperate with the superintendent with respect to all 
11certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction.  A jurisdiction may not 
12be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the superintendent has determined 
13that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United 
14States judgments and arbitration awards.  The superintendent may consider 
15additional factors.
16(b)  If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has published a 
17list of recommended qualified jurisdictions, the superintendent shall consider 
18that list in determining qualified jurisdictions.  If the superintendent 
19recognizes a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list 
20published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the 
21superintendent shall make detailed findings of fact supporting the recognition 
22in accordance with criteria to be developed in rules adopted under subsection 
237.
24(c)  United States jurisdictions that are accredited by the National Association 
25of Insurance Commissioners must be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.
26(d)  If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified 
27jurisdiction, the superintendent may suspend the reinsurer's certification 
28indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.
29(4)  The superintendent shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due 
30consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating 
31agencies determined to be acceptable pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 
327.  The superintendent shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their 
33ratings.
34(5)  A certified reinsurer shall secure all obligations assumed from United States 
35ceding insurers under this subsection, and under comparable laws of other states, 
36at a level consistent with its rating and in a form acceptable to the superintendent, 
37in compliance with rules adopted under subsection 7.
38(a)  If the security is insufficient, the superintendent shall reduce the 
39allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and may 
40impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a 
41material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full 
42when due.
Page 8 - 129LR3020(01)-11(b)  The reinsurer may secure its obligations as a certified reinsurer through a 
2multibeneficiary trust that meets the requirements of paragraph C and 
3subsection 2-A, with the following modifications.
4(i)  The maximum credit allowable may exceed the value of the 
5qualifying security to the extent provided in this subparagraph.
6(ii)  The minimum trusteed surplus is $10,000,000, rather than the 
7amount specified in paragraph C.
8(iii)  If the certified reinsurer also maintains a multibeneficiary trust for 
9obligations required to be fully secured under paragraph C or comparable 
10laws of other states, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust 
11accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued 
12or renewed with reduced security as permitted by this paragraph or 
13comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its 
14obligations that are required to be fully secured.  The trust accounts may 
15not be approved as qualifying security unless the reinsurer has bound 
16itself, by the language of the trust and by agreement with the insurance 
17regulator with principal oversight of each such trust account, to apply, 
18upon termination of any such trust account, the remaining surplus of that 
19trust to the extent necessary to fund any deficiency of any other such 
20trust account.
21(c)  If a certified reinsurer does not secure its obligations through a qualifying 
22multibeneficiary trust, it must secure its obligations to the ceding insurer 
23consistent with the requirements of subsection 3, except that the maximum 
24credit allowable may exceed the value of the qualifying security to the extent 
25provided in this subparagraph.
26(d)  For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose 
27certification has been terminated for any reason must be treated as a certified 
28reinsurer required to secure 100% of its obligations, unless the superintendent 
29has continued to assign a higher rating, as permitted by other provisions of 
30this section, to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose 
31certification has been suspended.
32(6)  If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a 
33jurisdiction accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 
34the superintendent may defer to that jurisdiction's certification to grant 
35certification in this State and may defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction.
36(7) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this State may 
37request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to 
38qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business.  An inactive certified 
39reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this 
40subsection, and the superintendent shall assign a rating that takes into account, if 
41relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.;
42B-3.  Meets each of the conditions established in subparagraphs (2) to (8).
Page 9 - 129LR3020(01)-11(1)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following 
2meanings.

7conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any 
8reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this State or for 
9allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance.
10(b)  "Reciprocal jurisdiction" means a jurisdiction that is:
11(i)  A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered 
12agreement with the United States, as long as each agreeing jurisdiction is

15member state of the European Union;
16(ii)  A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for 
17accreditation under the financial regulation standards and accreditation

23(2)  The assuming insurer must have its domicile or head office in, and be 
24licensed in, a reciprocal jurisdiction.
25(3)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain on an ongoing basis minimum 
26capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology 
27applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount established by rule. If the 
28assuming insurer is an association that includes incorporated and individual 
29unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain on an ongoing basis 
30minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according 
31to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund 
32containing a balance in amounts established by rule.
33(4)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain on an ongoing basis a 
34minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, as established by rule. If the 
35assuming insurer is an association that includes incorporated and individual

2taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;
3(b)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the 
4courts of this State and to the appointment of the superintendent as agent for 
5service of process.  The superintendent may require the assuming insurer to 
6include such consent in each reinsurance agreement for which credit is taken 
7under this paragraph.  This division does not limit or in any way alter the

11(c)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, 
12wherever enforcement is sought, that are obtained by a ceding insurer or its

16paragraph must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide 
17security for the full amount of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to

20jurisdiction where the final judgment was obtained or resists enforcement of 
21a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether the judgment or award is 
22obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its 
23resolution estate.  As used in this division, "resolution estate" means the 
24estate of an insurer or reinsurer that has been placed into a receivership or 
25comparable legal status; and
26(e)  The assuming insurer must confirm that it is not participating in any 
27solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this State's ceding insurers and 
28must agree to notify the ceding insurer and the superintendent and to provide 
29security for the full amount of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding 
30insurer should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of 
31arrangement.  Such security must be in a form consistent with the provisions 
32of paragraph B-2 and subsection 3 and as specified by the superintendent by 
33rule.
34(6)  The assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide, on behalf of itself 
35and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the superintendent as 
36specified by the superintendent by rule, if requested by the superintendent.
37(7)  The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims 
38under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria established by rule.
39(8)  The supervisory authority for insurance for the jurisdiction of the assuming 
40insurer must confirm to the superintendent on an annual basis that, as of the 
41preceding December 31st or the annual date specified in statute for reporting to 
42that supervisory authority in the assuming insurer's jurisdiction, the assuming 
43insurer complies with the requirements of subparagraphs (3) and (4).
Page 11 - 129LR3020(01)-11(9)  The assuming insurer may provide additional information on a voluntary 
2basis.
3(10)  The superintendent shall promptly create, publish and administer a list of 
4reciprocal jurisdictions as described in this subparagraph.
5(a)  The superintendent shall include all reciprocal jurisdictions identified in 
6subparagraph (1), division (b), subdivisions (i) and (ii) in the list maintained 
7pursuant to this subparagraph.
8(b)  If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has published a 
9list of recommended reciprocal jurisdictions, the superintendent shall 
10consider that list and may defer to that list in determining whether a 
11jurisdiction qualifies as a reciprocal jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (1), 
12division (b), subdivision (iii). The superintendent may determine that a 
13jurisdiction that does not appear on the recommended list is a reciprocal 
14jurisdiction in accordance with criteria established in rules adopted by the 
15superintendent.
16(c)  If a jurisdiction has been determined to be a reciprocal jurisdiction 
17pursuant to subparagraph (1), division (b), subdivision (iii), the 
18superintendent, in accordance with a process established by rule by the 
19superintendent, may determine that the jurisdiction is no longer a reciprocal 
20jurisdiction and remove it from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a 
21determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the conditions of this 
22paragraph.  Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for 
23reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has its head office or is 
24domiciled in that jurisdiction is allowed only as otherwise allowed pursuant 
25to this section.
26(11)  The superintendent shall promptly create, publish and administer a list of 
27assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (2) 
28to (8) for recognition for credit for reinsurance. The superintendent may add an 
29assuming insurer to the list if it has been listed under a substantially similar law 
30by a jurisdiction accredited by the National Association of Insurance 
31Commissioners or if, upon a request for recognition of eligibility, the assuming 
32insurer submits the information to the superintendent as required under 
33subparagraph (5) and complies with any additional requirements that the 
34superintendent may impose by rule, except to the extent that those requirements 
35conflict with an applicable covered agreement.
36(12)  If the superintendent determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets 
37one or more of the conditions of this paragraph, the superintendent may suspend 
38or revoke the recognition of the assuming insurer for credit for reinsurance under 
39this paragraph in accordance with procedures established by rule.
40(a)  While an assuming insurer's recognition for credit is suspended, a 
41reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of 
42the suspension does not qualify for credit under this paragraph.  Credit may 
43be granted only to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the 
Page 12 - 129LR3020(01)-11contract are secured in accordance with other provisions of this subsection or 
2with subsection 3.
3(b)  If an assuming insurer's recognition for credit is revoked, credit for 
4reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation with 
5respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, 
6including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation, 
7except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract 
8are secured in a form acceptable to the superintendent and consistent with 
9other provisions of this subsection or with subsection 3.
10(13)  If a ceding insurer that has been granted credit under this paragraph is 
11subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation, the ceding 
12insurer or its representative may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court 
13in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring the 
14assuming insurer to post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.
15(14)  This paragraph does not limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a 
16reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that 
17reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this section or other 
18applicable law or rule.
19(15)  Credit under this paragraph may be taken only for reinsurance pursuant to 
20reinsurance agreements entered into, renewed or amended on or after the 
21effective date of this paragraph and only with respect to losses incurred or 
22reserves reported on or after the date on which the assuming insurer has met all 
23eligibility requirements pursuant to subparagraphs (2) to (8) or the effective date 
24of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment or renewal, whichever is later.
25This subparagraph does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit 
26for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this paragraph, as 
27long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision 
28of this section.
29(16)  Nothing in this paragraph:
30(a)  Authorizes an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security 
31provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms 
32of the agreement; or
33(b)  Limits, or in any way alters, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance 
34agreement to renegotiate the agreement;
35C.  Maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution for the 
36payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and 
37successors in interest.
38(1)  The assuming insurer shall report annually to the superintendent information 
39substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association 
40of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to 
41enable the superintendent to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund.
Page 13 - 129LR3020(01)-11(2)  In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust must consist of a trusteed 
2account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance 
3ceded by United States ceding insurers and, in addition, unless the assuming 
4insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the 
5trust for at least 3 full years, must include a trusteed surplus of at least 
6$20,000,000.  The trust must provide that after the assuming insurer has 
7permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at 
8least 3 full years, the insurance regulator with principal oversight of the trust may 
9authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, 
10based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate 
11for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in 
12light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development.  The risk assessment 
13may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves 
14and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors, including when 
15applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss 
16estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's 
17liquidity or solvency.  The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be 
18reduced to an amount less than 30% of the assuming insurer's liabilities 
19attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the 
20trust.
21(3-A)  A group including incorporated and individual unincorporated 
22underwriters may secure its obligations with funds held in trust in compliance 
23with the following standards.
24(a)  For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, 
25amendment or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust must consist 
26of a trusteed account in an amount at least equal to the respective 
27underwriters' several liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United 
28States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter that is a member of the 
29group.
30(b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, for reinsurance 
31ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before 
32December 31, 1992 and not amended or renewed after that date, the trust 
33must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective 
34underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to 
35business written in the United States.
36(c) In addition, the group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of at least 
37$100,000,000 held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled 
38ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.
39An incorporated member of the group may not be engaged in any business other 
40than underwriting as a member of the group and is subject to the same level of 
41solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the 
42unincorporated members. Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to 
43be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the 
44superintendent an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the 
Page 14 - 129LR3020(01)-11solvency of each underwriter member of the group or, if a certification is 
2unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants.
3(4-A)  The superintendent in rules adopted pursuant to subsection 7 may establish 
4alternative criteria for approval of a reinsurance trust if the superintendent 
5determines that the criteria provide adequate protection to policyholders of 
6United States ceding insurers and are in substantial conformance with standards 
7approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
8(5)  The trust must be established in a form approved by the superintendent and 
9consistent with any rules adopted by the superintendent pursuant to this section.  
10The form of the trust and any amendments to the trust must also have been 
11approved by the insurance regulatory official of the state where the trust is 
12domiciled or of another state that, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, 
13has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.  The trust instrument 
14must provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order 
15of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.  The trust must vest 
16legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for the benefit of the assuming 
17insurer's United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.  
18The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination, as determined by 
19the superintendent, at the assuming insurer's expense.  The trust must remain in 
20effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under 
21the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.
22(6)  The trustees of the trust shall report to the superintendent in writing by 
23February 28th of each year, setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the 
24trust's investments at the end of the preceding year and certifying the date of 
25termination of the trust, if so planned, or certifying that the trust does not expire 
26before December 31st of the current year.
27(7)  The corpus of the trust is to be valued as any other admitted asset or assets; 
28or
29D.  Does not meet the requirements of paragraph A, B, B-1, B-2, B-3 or C, but only 
30with respect to risks located in a jurisdiction where that reinsurance is required by 
31law.  The superintendent may waive the requirements of subsections 2 and 5 to the 
32extent that compliance with those requirements is not feasible for compulsory 
33reinsurance subject to this paragraph.  The superintendent for good cause after notice 
34and opportunity for hearing may disallow or reduce the credit otherwise permitted 
35under this paragraph.

13SUMMARY
14This bill updates several provisions of the Maine Insurance Code by incorporating 
15recent amendments to model laws adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
16Commissioners, or NAIC, and making related technical changes.
17It corrects a conflict in the law governing examination of insurers by the 
18Superintendent of Insurance and eliminates obsolete transition language.
19It clarifies that adjudicatory proceedings conducted under the Maine Revised 
20Statutes, Title 24-A, section 222 to review changes of control of domestic insurers are 
21governed by the same procedural requirements as other Department of Professional and 
22Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance adjudicatory proceedings and that multistate 
23proceedings conducted under Maine law are considered public proceedings to the same 
24extent as single-state proceedings subject only to the exceptions expressly enumerated in 
25Title 24-A, section 222, subsection 7-A, paragraph D.
26It clarifies that when an insurer or insurance group is required to conduct an own risk 
27and solvency assessment, the assessment must be conducted in compliance with the 
28NAIC Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Guidance Manual, as well as include 
29the summary report as required under current law.
30It corrects a conflict between Title 24-A, section 731-B, subsections 1 and 3, 
31clarifying that subsection 1 is not the exclusive mechanism by which credit for 
32reinsurance may be granted.
33It provides that documents that a certified reinsurer is required to file are not public 
34records if they are confidential under the laws of the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction.
35It brings Maine into compliance with the bilateral agreements entered into by the 
36United States with the European Union and the United Kingdom by enacting the 2019 
37amendments to the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law, which provide a 
38mechanism for large, financially strong non-United States reinsurers to qualify for 
Page 17 - 129LR3020(01)-11eligibility by reciprocity to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers without posting 
2security.
3It corrects a NAIC drafting error from 2000 that inadvertently transposed the content 
4of the definitions of "repurchase transaction" and "reverse repurchase transaction."
5It corrects an inconsistency between Title 24-A, section 4215, subsection 1, which 
6requires health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, to be examined by the 
7Superintendent of Insurance at least every 3 years, and Title 24-A, section 221, which 
8applies to HMOs pursuant to Title 24-A, section 4222-B, subsection 5 and which permits 
9the examination period to be extended to 5 years.  It also authorizes the superintendent to 
10accept the domiciliary chief regulatory official's examination in satisfaction of Maine's 
11requirement when a company is domiciled outside Maine.  The purpose of these 
12amendments is to allow Maine to participate in coordinated examinations with 
13synchronized schedules for HMOs that are members of insurance groups.
14It amends the reciprocity provisions of Maine's receivership laws by recognizing as 
15reciprocal states those states with laws determined by the superintendent to be adequate 
16or substantially similar to the NAIC's model insolvency laws, and brings Maine into 
17conformity with the NAIC's guidelines for interstate recognition of stays and injunctions 
18in receivership.
