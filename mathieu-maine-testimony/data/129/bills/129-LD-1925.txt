153-A.  Elver fishing quotas.  The commissioner may adopt rules to establish, 
16implement and administer an elver individual fishing quota system in order to ensure that 
17the elver fishery annual landings do not exceed the overall annual quota established by 
18the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Except as provided in section 6575-L, a 
19person issued a license under this section or section 6302-A, subsection 3, paragraph E, 
20E-1, F or G may not take, possess or sell elvers an amount of elver quota in excess of the 
21weight quota allocated to that person under the quota system. The rules must:
22A.  Establish an overall annual quota for the State;
23B.  Establish the amount of the overall annual quota under paragraph A that is 
24allocated to persons licensed under this section and specify a formula to establish 
25individual quotas for persons licensed under this section.  The formula may take into 
26account the amount of elvers a person licensed under this section lawfully harvested 
27in previous seasons based on final harvesting reports.  The rules must specify the date 
28by which harvester reports are considered final for the purpose of determining 
29individual quotas; and
30C.  Provide, in accordance with section 6302-B, that 21.9% of the overall annual 
31quota under paragraph A is allocated to the federally recognized Indian tribes in the 
32State and establish the amount of that portion of the overall annual quota allocated to 
33the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
34Indians and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.
35If persons issued licenses under this section collectively exceed the overall annual quota 
36allocated to those persons pursuant to paragraph B, the number of pounds by which the 
37license holders exceeded that overall annual quota must be deducted from the following 
38year's overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section. If the overage 
39exceeds the overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section for the 
40following year, the overage must be deducted from the overall annual quota allocated to 
41persons licensed under this section in subsequent years until the entire overage has been 
42accounted for.
Page 3 - 129LR3018(01)-11The commissioner may adopt or amend rules on an emergency basis if immediate action 
2is necessary to establish and implement the elver individual fishing quota in advance of 
3the beginning of the elver fishing season.
4Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
5chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
6Sec. 6.  12 MRSA §6575-K, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 131, §2, is 
7further amended to read:
81.  Prohibition on possession or sale of elvers in excess of elver individual fishing 
9quota.  A person may not possess or sell a weight of elvers an amount of elver individual 
10fishing quota that exceeds the elver individual fishing quota that person has been 
11allocated for the fishing season pursuant to section 6505-A, subsection 3-A, plus any 
12additional quota the person may be authorized to take under section 6575-L.
13Sec. 7.  12 MRSA §6575-K, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2015, c. 131, §2, is 
14further amended to read:
152.  Prohibition on fishing after elver individual fishing quota has been reached.  
16Except as provided in section 6575-L, this section applies to fishing after a person's elver 
17individual fishing quota has been reached.  A person who has sold a weight of elvers an 
18amount of elver individual fishing quota that meets or exceeds that person's elver 
19individual fishing quota may not fish for or possess elvers for the remainder of the 
20season, except that such a person who has been issued a license to fish for elvers may in 
21accordance with section 6575-D assist another person who has been issued a license to 
22fish for elvers who has not met or exceeded that person's elver individual fishing quota as 
23provided in section 6505-A, subsection 3-A.  All gear tagged by a license holder who has 
24met or exceeded that person's elver individual fishing quota must be removed.  A marine 
25patrol officer may seize the elver transaction card of a license holder who has met or 
26exceeded that person's elver individual fishing quota.
27Sec. 8.  12 MRSA §6851, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2009, c. 523, §8, is 
28further amended to read:
292-A.  Wholesale seafood license with lobster permit.  At the request of the 
30applicant, the commissioner shall issue a wholesale seafood license with a lobster permit.  
31A person holding a wholesale seafood license with a lobster permit may engage in all the 
32activities in subsection 2 and may buy, sell, process or ship lobster or properly licensed or 
33lawfully imported lobster meat or parts.  A person holding a wholesale seafood license 
34with a lobster permit may transport lobster or properly licensed or lawfully imported 
35lobster meat or parts anywhere within the state limits.  A license under this subsection 
36does not authorize a person to possess or transport lobster that person has taken unless 
37that person is in possession of a license issued under section 6421, subsection 3-A, 
38paragraph A, B, C or E.  A license under this subsection does not authorize a person to 
39remove lobster meat from the shell unless a license under section 6851-B or 6857 is held.
Page 4 - 129LR3018(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill makes technical changes to Maine's marine resources laws.  It clarifies that it 
3is the amount of quota, not the weight of elvers, sold through the elver transaction card 
4system that is used to determine if an allocated quota has been exceeded.  It clarifies that 
5if a person holds a license in a limited entry fishery and that license has been suspended 
6by the court, by the Department of Health and Human Services or by the Department of 
7Administrative and Financial Services, Maine Revenue Services, the person, when the 
8person becomes compliant, has the remainder of that calendar year and all of the 
9following calendar year to purchase the license.  It clarifies that a person who holds a 
10wholesale seafood license with a lobster permit may remove lobster meat from the shell 
11under either a lobster processor license or a lobster meat permit.
