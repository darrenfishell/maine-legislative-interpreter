8 SUMMARY 
9 This amendment replaces "immlmity" with "limited liability" to provide a clearer 
10 description of the law. It also provides that the limitation on a campground owner's or 
11 operator's liability does not apply unless notice of the assumption of risk of the inherent 
12 risks of camping is given. It changes . the title of the bill to be consistent with these 
13 changes.
