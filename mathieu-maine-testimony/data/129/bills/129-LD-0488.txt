3from personal injury or death that results from the inherent risk of camping.  It is the duty 
4of a camping participant to act within the limits of the camping participant's own ability, 
5to heed all warnings and refrain from acting in a manner that may cause or contribute to 
6the injury of any person or damage to any property.  Except as provided in subsection 4, a

133.  Warning notice.  For purposes of this section, notice of the inherent risks of 
14camping may be satisfied by a statement signed by the camping participant and a sign or 
15signs prominently displayed at the private campground.  A private campground owner or 
16operator shall post a warning notice in substantially the following form at the place of 
17registration:
18"WARNING:
19Under Maine law, a camper or a guest of the camper in a private campground assumes 
20the risk of any injury to person or property resulting from any of the inherent dangers and 
21risks of camping and may not recover damage or damages from any private campground 
22owner or operator for any injury or death resulting from any of the inherent dangers and 
23risks of camping.  The inherent dangers and risks of camping include but are not limited 
24to, water activities such as swimming, boating, water-skiing and fishing; changing 
25weather conditions; surface or subsurface conditions, such as rocks, stumps, trees, forest 
26growth or other natural objects; variations in terrain; and the failure of campers and their 
27guests to recreate safely, in control and within their own abilities."
284.  Exceptions.  Nothing in subsection 2 prevents or limits the liability of a private 
29campground owner or operator if the campground owner or operator:
30A.  Commits an act or omission that constitutes negligence or reckless disregard for 
31the safety of others, and that act or omission causes an injury or death.  For purposes 
32of this section, "reckless" has the same meaning as "recklessly," as defined in Title 
3317-A, section 35, subsection 3, paragraph A;
34B.  Has actual knowledge or reasonably should have known of a dangerous condition 
35of the private campground land, facilities or equipment and does not make the danger 
36known to a camping participant, and the danger causes an injury or death; or
37C.  Intentionally injures a camping participant.
