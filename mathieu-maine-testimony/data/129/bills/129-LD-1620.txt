4C.  The following provisions govern limitations on earnable compensation.
5(1)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, except as provided 
6in subparagraph (3), for the purposes of determining average final compensation, 
7"earnable compensation" does not include any increase that exceeds the prior 
8year's earnable compensation by more than 5% or that results in a total increase 
9of more than 10% during the 3-year period used in the calculation of average 
10final compensation, unless the cost of the additional actuarial liability arising 
11from the excess increase is paid by the employer as provided in section 17154.  
12Any payment made under paragraph B, subparagraph (1) must be included in 
13determining the amount of increase in the year in which the payment is made.  
14This subparagraph does not apply to excess increases resulting from 
15compensation paid prior to July 1, 1993, from compensation paid in accordance 
16with an individual employment contract executed prior to July 1, 1993 or a 
17collective bargaining agreement executed or ratified in its final form by final vote 
18of one party to the agreement prior to July 1, 1993 for the initial term of that 
19contract or agreement or from other action by the governing body of a school 
20administrative unit in effect on July 1, 1993.  This subparagraph does not apply to 
21increases in compensation of state employees during fiscal year 1993-94 and 
22fiscal year 1994-95.  In all circumstances in which this subparagraph does not 
23apply to earnable compensation of state employees and teachers, the provisions 
24of this subparagraph that were in effect prior to June 30, 1993 apply.  This 
25subparagraph does not apply to earnable compensation of employees of 
26participating local districts.
27(2)  Effective October 1, 1999, the 5% limitation and the 10% limitation on 
28increases in earnable compensation set out in subparagraph (1) may not be 
29changed to a lower percentage for members who, on October 1, 1999 or 
30thereafter, meet the creditable service requirement for eligibility to receive a 
31service retirement benefit, at the applicable age if so required, under section 
3217851 or section 17851-A, subsection 2.
33(3) Collectively bargained salary or wage increases pursuant to Title 26, chapter 
349-A, 9-B or 12 or job promotion may not be considered in calculating salary or 
35wage increases for the purposes of subparagraph (1).
36SUMMARY

38purpose of determining average final compensation under the Maine Public Employees 
39Retirement System that were in statute before significant changes were made in 1993.
