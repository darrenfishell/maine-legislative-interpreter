Fiscal Detail and Notes
Any additional costs or revenues accruing to the Department  of Professional and Financial Regulation as a result of 
this bill are expected to be minor. This bill requires that all student loan debt collection cases be filed as civil actions. These cases are currently filed as 
small claims cases, which include a mediation fee collected by the judicial department. Moving these cases to civil 
filings would result in a loss of this mediation fee, whic h is estimated to total about $84,000 annually. Assuming this 
bill is effective in December, it is estimated revenue will fall by $49,000 in fiscal year 2020-21. Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
