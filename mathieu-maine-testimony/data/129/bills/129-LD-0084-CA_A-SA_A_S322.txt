This amendment reduces the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$22,360 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $34,065 in fiscal year 2020-21 due to the removal of the cost associated with the 
fiscal intermediary service which is not required to allow eligible members to receive services provided by spouses. 
Federal Expenditures Fund allocations will also be reduced for the FMA.P portion of the cost.
