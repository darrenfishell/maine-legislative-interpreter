undergraduate student responsible for any amount of the cost of attendance that exceeds 
the student's expected family contribution. If the cost of attendance exceeds the expected 
family contribution plus costs covered by Stafford loans, the school may award the 
student grants or scholarships to cover the remaining cost of attendance, but in no case 
may the postsecondary institution require that the student repay any costs associated with 
those grants or scholarships.'

from billing or otherwise holding an in-state undergraduate student responsible for any 
amount of the cost of attendance at that postsecondary institution that exceeds the 
student's expected family contribution, with the exception of federal Stafford loans.

Reduction in tuition revenue -Higher educational institutions 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Prohibiting the State's higher educational institutions to bill for costs that exceed a student's expected family 
contribution will result in a loss of tuition revenue to the University of Maine System, the Maine Community College 
System and the Maine Maritime Academy. The impact on revenue will depend on actual experience, but estimates 
provided by the University of Maine System, the Maine Community College and the Maine Maritime Academy 
indicate annual revenue reductions of approximately $71.4 million, $27.5 million and $11.1 million respectively. It is 
not clear how much of these revenue reductions can be absorbed tln·ough program and other expenditure cuts or 
whether the institutions will seek additional General Fund appropriations in the future.
