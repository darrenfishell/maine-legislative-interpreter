Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The Maine Labor Relations Board (MLRB) anticipates that it will be able to implement the requirements of this 
legislations within existing budgeted resources. However, the MLRB does incur costs to conduct ballot elections as 
the elections are conducted through the United States mail at a cost of $1.32 per voter. The total cost to the MLRB to 
conduct an election depends on the number of individuals eligible to vote, the number of employee organizations on 
the ballot and whether or not a second ''run-off' election will be required. If the elections required as a result of this 
legislation result in costs exceeding the amount budgeted for this purpose in any fiscal year, the MLRB may need to 
request additional General Fund appropriations.
