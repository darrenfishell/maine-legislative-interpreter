vehicle solely based on ownership of the motor vehicle. The provider retains liability 
regardless of any lapse in the provider's policy or whether that liability is covered under 
the provider's policy or any other insurance policy under which the provider is insured. 
2. Indemnification. In the event that the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle 
owner's insurer is named as a defendant in a civil action for a loss or injury that occurs 
during any time within the car sharing period or when the motor vehicle is under the 
control of the provider, the provider's insurer has the duty to defend and indemnify the 
shared vehicle owner and the shared vehicle owner's insurer.

may issue or issue for delivery in this State any policy of liability and property and 
casualty insurance to a provider to insure the provider and any shared vehicle driver or 
authorized operator or occupant of a shared vehicle and any employee, agent or officer of 
the program as long as the policy meets the requirements of this section. 
2. Coordination of insurance. A program policy written in accordance with this 
section is primary with respect to any other insurance available to the shared vehicle 
owner but is secondary with respect to any other insurance available to the shared vehicle 
driver or authorized operator or occupant of the shared vehicle. The policy must comply 
with the requirements of section 7403, subsection 4. 
3. Filing of rates and forms. For the purposes of any insurance policy written in

provides coverage for any shared vehicle driver or authorized operator or occupant of a 
shared vehicle as an insured under the policy to the same extent that coverage would be

this chapter. 
2. Enforcement actions. The superintendent may assess civil penalties or take any 
other action permitted under section 12-A against any person who violates any provision 
of this chapter or the superintendent's rules and orders. and nothing in this section may be 
construed as limiting the superintendent's authority to take enforcement action under 
section 12-A in connection with violations of applicable provisions of this Title. 
3. Administrative procedures. Any person aggrieved by an order of the 
superintendent under this chapter may submit an application for a hearing as provided in

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment removes the provisions of Part A 
of the bill, which require private vehicle rentals to comply with the same laws that apply 
to rental vehicles, rental vehicle transactions and rental vehicle companies. 
The amendment replaces the provision relating to insurance requirements for private 
vehicle rentals, using different terminology to describe the practice as peer-to-peer car 
sharing and establishing insurance requirements for peer-to-peer car sharing programs. 
The amendment also sets forth parameters for liability when a loss or injury occurs during 
a car sharing period or while a motor vehicle is under the control of a peer-to-peer car 
sharing program.
