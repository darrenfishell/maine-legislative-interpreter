21for property tax deferral under this chapter, the State Tax Assessor shall send notice by 
22certified mail to the owner taxpayer, or the owner's taxpayer's heirs or devisees, listing 
23the total amount of deferred property taxes, including accrued interest and costs of all the

30date, the State Tax Assessor shall, within 30 days, record in the registry of deeds in the

17municipality, the State Tax Assessor shall certify that amount to the Treasurer of the

19following month.

21prorate payments to municipalities for claims filed pursuant to this chapter if the amount 
22available in the Senior Property Tax Deferral Revolving Account established in section 
236266 in any fiscal year is insufficient to make full payments to all municipalities.  If the 
24applicant for deferred taxes can not pay the difference due to the municipality, the 
25municipality that does not receive the full amount of deferred property taxes may cause a 
26tax lien certificate to be filed in the county registry of deeds for the amount not received.

28reimburse taxpayers who qualified under this chapter and who have paid property taxes 
29that would have otherwise been deferred but for the prorating of benefits as allowed in

32property and shall accrue interest only on the actual amount of taxes payments advanced 
33to the municipality.
34Sec. 8.  36 MRSA §6267, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 707, Pt. G, §10, is repealed.

Page 5 - 129LR0882(01)-11SUMMARY
2This bill reinstates the State's elderly property tax deferral program, which until April 
31, 1991 provided a mechanism allowing qualifying senior homeowners to defer property 
4tax payments and required the State to pay the property taxes on behalf of the 
5homeowners.  This bill modifies the program's eligibility standards by increasing the 
6household income threshold from less than $32,000 to less than $40,000 and adding a 
7liquid asset limit.  The bill makes the existing abatement and appeal processes available 
8in cases in which the State Tax Assessor disagrees with the municipal assessment of a 
9property eligible for enrollment in the program.
