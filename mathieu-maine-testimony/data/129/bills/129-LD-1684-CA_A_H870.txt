30in a secure facility: whether the juvenile was under 14 years of age at the time of the

Any additional costs to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services as a result of this bill are expected to be 
minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.The bill makes several changes to the laws regarding the Ri ght of Counsel and Due Process for Juveniles. As a result 
of these changes, the Department of Corrections (DOC ) anticipates it will make two additional trips per week 
transporting juveniles to and from the court system. The bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the DOC of 
$74,370 in fiscal year 2020-21 to fund an additional assist ant classifications officer, overtime pay for transport 
officers and funding for one a dditional transportion vehicle.This bill will neither increase nor decrease the number of new cases. 
This bill may increase administrative costs and the workload of  judicial and clerk staff, but the Courts do not require 
additional funding at this time.Fiscal Note129th MAINE LEGISLATURE
