12drug concentration of a person who is complying with the duty to submit to a 
13chemical test. Only a physician, registered physician's assistant, registered nurse or 
14person whose occupational license or training allows that person to draw blood 
15samples may draw a specimen of blood for the purpose of determining the blood-
16alcohol level or the presence of a drug or drug metabolite.  This limitation does not

2This bill amends certain laws governing snowmobiles and watercraft to make them 
3consistent with laws governing all-terrain vehicles. Specifically, this bill:
41.  Extends to operators of snowmobiles and watercraft certain penalties that apply to 
5violations applicable to operation of all-terrain vehicles that result in the mandatory 
6revocation of a license;
72.  Updates the laws concerning operation of a recreational vehicle while under the 
8influence to more closely mirror the laws governing operation of a motor vehicle while 
9under the influence;
103.  Extends the general prohibition against the fraudulent acquisition or possession of 
11licenses and permits issued by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to also 
12apply to registrations and repeals specific prohibitions that are therefore unnecessary;
134.  Exempts from registration fees motorboats used for governmental purposes and 
14owned and operated in the State by the Federal Government, the State or a political 
15subdivision of the State;
165.  Specifies that, for purposes of the laws governing recreational vehicles, a motor 
17vehicle is not a snowmobile; and
186.  Removes language that limits to on or adjacent to a snowmobile trail the location 
19of a snowmobile collision that constitutes operating a snowmobile to endanger.
