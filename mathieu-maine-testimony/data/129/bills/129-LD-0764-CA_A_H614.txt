subject to reevaluation; and 
Whereas, the separation of powers concept enshrined in the Constitution of Maine 
limits the options available for reducing access to criminal records; and 
Whereas, the Criminal Records Review Committee is established in this resolve to 
develop a proposed policy on the appropriate access to criminal records; and 
Whereas, the work of the committee must be initiated before the 90-day period 
expires in order that the work may be completed and a report submitted in time for 
submission to the next legislative session; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as
