Page 1 - 129LR1325(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §101, sub-§17-A is enacted to read:
317-A.  Criminal negligence.  "Criminal negligence" has the same meaning as in Title 
417-A, section 35, subsection 4.
5Sec. 2.  29-A MRSA §2436 is enacted to read:
6§2436.  Result as an element; causation
71.  Causation.  Unless otherwise provided, when causing a result is an element of an 
8offense under this chapter, causation may be found when the result would not have 
9occurred but for the conduct of the defendant, operating either alone or concurrently with 
10another cause.
112.  Concurrent causation.  In cases in which concurrent causation is generated as an 
12issue, the defendant's conduct must also have been sufficient by itself to produce the 
13result.
14Sec. 3.  29-A MRSA §2458, sub-§2-A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 13, §1, is 
15further amended to read:
162-A.  Minimum suspension for negligent operation.  The Secretary of State 
17without preliminary hearing shall suspend for a period of at least 3 years a person's 
18license if the Secretary of State, based on the Secretary of State's records or other 
19sufficient evidence, finds that person to have negligently operated a motor vehicle with 
20criminal negligence in a manner so as to cause the death of another person.  Prior to the 
21determination and issuance of the suspension, the Secretary of State shall notify any 
22family of the victim and shall consider written or oral statements received from the family 
23in response to the notice.  Upon suspending the person's license, the Secretary of State 
24shall notify that person of an opportunity for hearing as provided in section 2483.  If a 
25person whose license is suspended under this subsection requests a hearing, the 
26suspension is stayed pursuant to section 2483.
27SUMMARY
28This bill applies to motor vehicle offenses the definition of "criminal negligence" and 
29the use of causation as an element of an offense as used in the Maine Criminal Code.  
30This bill also changes the standard for minimum suspension for negligent operation of a 
31motor vehicle causing the death of another person from "negligently" to "with criminal 
32negligence" and removes the provision requiring the Secretary of State to notify any 
33family of the victim or to consider written or oral statements from the family prior to the 
34determination and issuance of the suspension.
