Fiscal Detail and Notes
This bill provides that during the interim between the expira tion of a municipal, judicial  and public higher education 
employee collective bargaining agreement and before the e ffective date of any subsequent collective bargaining 
agreement the employees covered by the expired agreement must receive step and/or merit increases in accordance 
with the terms and conditions set forth in the expired agreem ent. Assuming the increases would not be granted in the 
absence of this bill, these increases would represent a cost to municipal, school, county and higher education 
employers. No estimate of this cost is available at this tim e and no funding is provided in the bill. The Judicial Branch 
has indicated that in recent years without this bill, such increases may have been delayed but not foregone. The delay 
was only until a new collective bargaining agreement had been reached, at which time increases were made retroactively. Therefore, no additional cost s are anticipated for the Judicial Branch. Fiscal Note
