SUMMARY 
The bill resolves an inconsistency in the State's liquor laws by clarifying that an out­
of-state spirits supplier must obtain a certificate of approval from the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
Operations before it may transport spirits into the State for sale to the bureau or cause 
spirits to be transported into the State for sale to the bureau. 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, clarifies that only 
out-of-state spirits manufacturers and persons that engage in the out-of-state purchase of 
spirits for resale to the bureau are required to obtain a certificate of approval under the 
process established in the bill. The amendment further clarifies that, when out-of-state 
spirits suppliers ship spirits to Maine, the spirits must be delivered to a warehouse 
designated by the State Liquor and Lottery Commission. 
Under the bill, an out-of-state spirits supplier is required to pay a $1,000 annual fee to 
obtain a certificate of approval, except that an out-of-state spirits supplier that ships 120 
gallons of spirits or less to Maine per year is only required to pay a $100 annual fee. The 
amendment converts the total volume amount used to determine whether an out-of-state 
spirits supplier is eligible to pay the $100 reduced fee from gallons to liters, which is the 
unit of measurement typically used in the spirits industry. The amendment delays the 
effective date of the bill until September 1, 2020 and provides that an out-of-state spirits 
supplier that is not eligible to pay the $100 reduced fee is only required to pay $500 for a 
certificate of approval for the first year that the provision is in effect. Beginning 
September 1, 2021, the annual fee for an out-of-state spirits supplier that is not eligible to
