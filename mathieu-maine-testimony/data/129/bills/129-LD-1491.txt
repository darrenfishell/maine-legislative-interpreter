31SUMMARY
32This bill replaces the Maine earned income credit under the income tax with the 
33Maine work credit.  The Maine work credit is similar to the federal earned income tax 
34credit but uses different factors for calculating the credit that are intended to produce a 
35state credit for individuals with qualifying children that is approximately equal to 30% of 
36the federal credit and for individuals with no qualifying children that is approximately 
37equal to 100% of the federal credit.  The bill also provides eligibility for individuals who 
38are at least 18 years of age but less than 25 years of age who have no qualifying children 
39and creates a minimum credit for students and eligible caregivers.
40The bill also establishes a working group to study ways to streamline applications for 
41tax credits intended to assist low to middle income taxpayers with the cost of basic 
Page 6 - 129LR0743(01)-11necessities and to permit administration of those credits as advance consolidated 
2payments.
