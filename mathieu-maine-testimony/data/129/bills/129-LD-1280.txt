26SUMMARY
27This bill establishes the Maine Buy American and Build Maine Act and requires that 
28all contracts for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or 
29maintenance of a public building or public work made by a state agency, board, 
30commission or institution contain a provision that the manufactured goods, including 
31iron, cement and steel, used or supplied in the performance of the contract or any 
32subcontract to the contract must be manufactured in the United States.  This requirement 
33does not apply to counties, municipalities or school administrative units.
34The bill requires that, in the case of a manufactured good other than an iron, cement 
35or steel product, all of the manufacturing processes take place in the United States and the 
36origin of the manufactured good's components or subcomponents meet a minimum level 
37of domestic content as established by rule.
38Under the Act, a public agency may apply to the Governor or the Governor's designee 
39for a waiver of the requirement if the executive head of the public agency finds that the 
40application of the requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest, that the 
Page 5 - 129LR0750(01)-11necessary manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and 
2reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality or that inclusion of 
3manufactured goods made in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project 
4contract by an unreasonable amount.  The Department of Administrative and Financial 
5Services is directed to develop rules to implement the Act.
6The bill requires that, if the department has reason to believe that any person, 
7business or other entity has intentionally made fraudulent representations about the 
8domestic content of a manufactured good or has intentionally violated any provision of 
9the Act, the department must, after a hearing, debar that person, business or other entity 
10from contracts or subcontracts with the State for 2 years.
11The bill provides that the provisions of this legislation must be applied in a manner 
12consistent with the State's obligations under any applicable international agreements 
13pertaining to government procurement.
14The bill also requires that, in the award of a bid for the construction, reconstruction, 
15alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of a public building or public work or for 
16services to be provided to or on behalf of the State, if 2 or more bids are submitted that 
17are substantially similar, preference must be given to the bid submitted by an in-state 
18contractor, which includes a business at which at least 60% of the employees are 
19residents of Maine.  If the bid submitted by an in-state contractor is higher than the lowest 
20bid submitted by a contractor that is not an in-state contractor, the in-state contractor must 
21be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid submitted.
