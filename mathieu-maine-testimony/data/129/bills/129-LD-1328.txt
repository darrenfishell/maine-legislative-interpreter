31SUMMARY
32This bill increases the Governor's salary from $70,000 per year to $125,000 per year.  
33Since the Constitution of Maine prohibits the increase of the salary of a sitting Governor, 
34this increase does not take effect until the election of a Governor not in office on 
35December 2, 2020.
36This bill also, beginning with the 130th Maine Legislature, increases the salary of 
37Maine Legislators from $14,862 in the first year and $10,613 in the 2nd year of a 
38biennium, after adjustment for inflation, to $20,000 in the first year and $15,000 in the 
392nd year of a biennium and the salary of a person who succeeds a member of the 
40Legislature who dies or otherwise vacates office.  This bill retains the annual cost-of-
41living adjustment for salary and clarifies that it applies to a successor's salary.  This bill 
Page 4 - 129LR0955(01)-11also increases the per diem meal and housing allowances paid to Legislators from $32 
2and $38 to $40 and $60, respectively.
