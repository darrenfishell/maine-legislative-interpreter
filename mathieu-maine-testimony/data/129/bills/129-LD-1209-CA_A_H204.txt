Minor cost increase -General Fund 
If the public hearing required by this bill is held during a legislative session, the portion of the Legislature's baseline 
budget used for committee meetings held during the legislative session would be used for this purpose. If a public 
hearing is held during the interim when the Legislature is not in regular or special session, the portion of the baseline 
budget reserved for interim committee meetings would be used for this purpose. Whether or not there will be 
sufficient funds to hold public hearings for a citizens initiative will depend on the number of committee meetings 
authorized for the interim.
