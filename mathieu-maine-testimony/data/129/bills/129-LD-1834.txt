14SUMMARY
15This bill is being reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice 
16and Public Safety pursuant to Joint Order 2019, H.P. 1278.  Under the current law, the 
17crime of engaging in prostitution is a Class E crime, punishable by a fine only; the 
18penalty for a subsequent conviction that occurs within 2 years of a prior conviction for 
19engaging in prostitution is a Class D crime.  This bill changes the penalty for a 
20subsequent conviction of engaging in prostitution that occurs within 2 years of the first 
21conviction to a Class E crime and specifies that a deferred disposition for subsequent 
22convictions is the preferred disposition.
