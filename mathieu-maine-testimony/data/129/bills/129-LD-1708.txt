Page 1 - 129LR2490(01)-11Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the Legislature created Hospital Administrative District No. 4 by Private 
4and Special Law 1973, chapter 76, in order to provide for the health, welfare and public 
5benefit of the inhabitants of the district; and
6Whereas, the district has determined that it is unable to continue to fulfill its 
7purpose of providing for the health, welfare and public benefit of the inhabitants of the 
8district unless it is affiliated with a strong, integrated health care system; and
9Whereas, the district has decided that it would be in the best interest of the district 
10to affiliate with Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems, doing business as Northern Light 
11Health, because of its experience of successfully operating other critical access hospitals 
12and the opportunity to create a network with other Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems' 
13hospitals located in the Piscataquis region to continue and improve the delivery of high-
14quality health care to the inhabitants of the district and the entire Piscataquis region; and
15Whereas, as authorized by the affirmative votes of their respective governing 
16boards, the district and Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems have entered into an 
17agreement and plan of merger dated March 19, 2019 setting forth the terms and 
18conditions by which the district will merge into MRH Corp., a Maine nonprofit, nonstock 
19private corporation having Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems as its sole member, as soon 
20as reasonably practicable; and
21Whereas, in advisory votes held during April 2019 at town meetings in the 13 towns 
22comprising the district, 12 of the 13 towns, representing 97.4% of the population of the 
23district, indicated their approval of the merger of the district; and
24Whereas, it is in the public interest for the district to be able to merge into MRH 
25Corp. as soon as practicable, as long as all conditions and the parties' respective 
26obligations under the agreement are satisfied, to ensure the continuation of the provision 
27for the health, welfare and public benefit of the inhabitants of the district; and
28Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, this merger is in the public interest; 
29and
30Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
31the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
32immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
33therefore,
34Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
35Sec. 1.  P&SL 1973, c. 76, as amended, is repealed.

21973, chapter 76, referred to in this Act as "the district," which owns and operates Mayo 
3Regional Hospital located in Dover-Foxcroft, is authorized to merge into MRH Corp., a 
4nonprofit, nonstock private corporation having Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems as its 
5sole member.  To the extent that any competition is supplanted by the merger, the merger 
6is not subject to state antitrust laws.
7The merger is subject to the following.

9except for the vote of the directors that occurred on March 19, 2019, no vote of the 
10district, any towns in the district or the inhabitants of either the district or towns in the 
11district is required to authorize the merger.
122.  The merger may occur only if, by operation of the merger, all indebtedness of the 
13district is paid or adequate provision for the payment of that indebtedness is made by the 
14assumption of liability indebtedness of the district by MRH Corp., by defeasance of any 
15outstanding bond of the district or otherwise.
163.  The merger and the legal effect of the merger are subject to and governed by the 
17Maine Revised Statutes, Title 13-B, chapter 9, with the same legal effect as if the district 
18were a Maine nonprofit corporation organized pursuant to and governed by the Maine 
19Nonprofit Corporation Act.
20Sec. 3.  Effective date and effect of merger.  The merger takes effect after all 
21conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger dated March 19, 2019 have been 
22satisfied and the articles of merger are filed with the Secretary of State, unless a different 
23date, which may not be more than 60 days after the filing, is specified in the articles of 
24merger.

35nonprofit corporations; and

39belonging to or due to the district, are deemed to be transferred to and vested in MRH 
Page 3 - 129LR2490(01)-11Corp. without further act or deed.  The title to any real estate, or any interest therein, 
2vested in the district may not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the merger.

4legislation takes effect when approved, except that section of this Act that repeals Private 
5and Special Law 1973, chapter 76 takes effect on the date the articles of merger are filed 
6with the Secretary of State or the date specified in the articles of merger, whichever is

8SUMMARY
9Private and Special Law 1973, chapter 76 created the charter for Hospital 
10Administrative District No. 4, which is served by Mayo Regional Hospital.  While the 
11charter allows for the dissolution of the district, it does not provide for the merger.  
12The effect of this bill is to authorize Mayo Regional Hospital to merge into a new 
13entity known as MRH Corp., a Maine nonprofit, nonstock private corporation that has as 
14its sole member Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems and, upon the effective date of the 
15merger, dissolve the district.  MRH Corp. is required to continue to serve the health care 
16needs of the communities served by the district.
