Potential current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
Establishing a pilot project in Washington County to provide treatment and recovery services for people with 
substance use disorder will require substantial time and resources from DHHS to assist with mobilizing, 
implementing, operating and evaluating the pilot project. As it is not known what potential federal funding may be 
available to fund this pilot and what type of services and administration might be covered by those federal sources, it 
is not currently known what impact this bill will have on DHHS funding.
