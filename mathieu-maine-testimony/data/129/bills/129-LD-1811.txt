14evaluation is certified in the affirmative, the person evaluated at the time of notice by law 
15enforcement under subsection 4, paragraph B becomes a restricted person subject to

13store and care for the weapons surrendered by a restricted person in the manner provided 
14in subsection 7.  A restricted person who makes all practical, immediate efforts to comply 
15with a surrender notice under subsection 4 is not subject to arrest or prosecution as a 
16prohibited person under Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraph E or E-1.  If a law 
17enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the restricted person possesses or 
18controls but has not surrendered a weapon, law enforcement may, prior to or as part of a 
19judicial hearing, search for and seize such a weapon when authorized by a judicially 
20issued warrant or other circumstances approved by law. 
216.  Judicial hearing.  A judicial hearing under this section is governed by this 
22subsection.
23A.  Within 5 days of the date of the notice given to a restricted person under 
24subsection 4, paragraph B, the district attorney in the district of the restricted person's 
25residence shall file a petition for judicial review of the initial restrictions by the 
26district court.  The district attorney shall provide to the restricted person written 
27notice of the petition and hearing at least 7 days prior to the hearing.  The restricted 
28person has the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing, and the court may 
29appoint counsel for an indigent party.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may 
30extend the time to hold the hearing.
31B.  Within 14 days of the notice given under subsection 4, the court shall hold a 
32hearing to determine whether to dissolve or extend the initial restrictions.  In the 
33hearing determining whether to dissolve or extend the initial restrictions, the district 
34attorney has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the restricted 
35person will in the foreseeable future pose a likelihood of serious harm, and that such 
36likelihood is exacerbated by the person's immediate access to a dangerous weapon.
37C.  In determining whether there are grounds to extend the initial restrictions, the 
38court shall consider all relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, recent threats 
39or acts of violence by the restricted person directed toward other persons; recent 
40threats or acts of violence by the restricted person directed toward the restricted 
41person; recent acts of unlawful abuse of animals by the restricted person; the reckless 
42use or threatening display of a dangerous weapon by the restricted person; a history 
43of the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force by the restricted person 
Page 4 - 129LR2536(01)-11against other persons; prior involuntary confinement of the restricted person in a 
2hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities; prior violations of protection or 
3harassment orders by the restricted person; evidence of stalking behavior, severe 
4obsession or sexual violence by the restricted person; the illegal use of controlled 
5substances by the restricted person; or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse by the 
6restricted person.  The court shall also consider whether the restricted person is 
7receiving treatment responsive to that person's mental health or substance use needs.
8D.  This paragraph governs court orders.
9(1)  If the court finds after hearing that there is not clear and convincing evidence 
10to continue or extend the initial restrictions, the court shall dissolve the initial 
11restrictions and order the return of any weapons surrendered or seized.  The court 
12shall direct the Department of Public Safety to remove the record of restrictions 
13from the department's database for protection orders.
14(2)  If the court finds after hearing that there is clear and convincing evidence to 
15continue or extend the initial restrictions, the court shall inform the restricted 
16person that the restricted person is prohibited for one year from purchasing, 
17possessing or controlling any dangerous weapon, or attempting to purchase, 
18possess or control any dangerous weapon.  The court shall further order the 
19person to immediately surrender dangerous weapons possessed or controlled by 
20that person to a law enforcement officer and order a law enforcement agency to 
21ensure that the record of the restrictions is entered in the Department of Public 
22Safety database for protection orders.
23(3)  Extended restrictions imposed under this paragraph expire one year from the 
24date the restrictions were ordered by the court.  The court shall schedule a 
25hearing within 45 days prior to the expiration of that one-year period to 
26determine if the order should be extended.  The district attorney has the burden of 
27proving that the restricted person continues to pose a likelihood of serious harm 
28to the restricted person or others and that such likelihood is exacerbated by the 
29restricted person's immediate access to a firearm or other dangerous weapon.  If, 
30after a hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 
31restricted person continues to pose a likelihood of serious harm, the court shall 
32renew the extended restrictions for one year.  If the court does not so find, the 
33court shall deny the petition and order the return of any weapons surrendered or 
34seized.  Upon motion by the State, the court may for cause shown order that the 
35restricted person be examined for evaluation of whether the restricted person 
36continues to pose a likelihood of serious harm to the restricted person or others 
37and that such likelihood is exacerbated by the restricted person's immediate 
38access to a dangerous weapon.  The fees or expenses for an examination or 
39evaluation pursuant to this subparagraph may be paid from the Extradition and 
40Prosecution Expenses Account established by Title 15, section 224-A.
41(4)  A restricted person may file one motion for dissolution during a one-year 
42period of extended restrictions.  For that motion, the restricted person has the 
43burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the restricted person no 
44longer poses a likelihood of serious harm to the restricted person or others or, if 
Page 5 - 129LR2536(01)-11such likelihood exists, that such likelihood is not exacerbated by the person's 
2immediate access to a dangerous weapon.
3(5)  A court shall transmit to the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State 
4Police, State Bureau of Identification an abstract of the order issued by the court 
5pursuant to this section that includes a prohibition on the possession of a 
6dangerous weapon.  The abstract must include the name, date of birth and gender 
7of the person who is the subject of the order; the court's order and the expiration 
8date of that order; and a notation that the person has been notified by the court.
9The abstract required by this subparagraph is confidential and is not a public 
10record as defined in Title 1, chapter 13; however, a copy of the abstract may be 
11provided by the State Bureau of Identification to a criminal justice agency for law 
12enforcement purposes, to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Instant 
13Criminal Background Check System, or to an issuing authority for the purpose of 
14processing concealed firearm permit applications. The State Bureau of 
15Identification shall request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ensure that, 
16immediately after the order expires, the National Instant Criminal Background 
17Check System no longer reflects that expired order as a ground for prohibiting 
18the subject of the order from possessing or acquiring a firearm.  For the purposes 
19of this subsection, "criminal justice agency" means a federal, state, tribal, district, 
20county or local government agency or any subunit of those entities that performs 
21the administration of criminal justice under a statute or executive order, and that 
22allocates a substantial part of its annual budget to the administration of criminal 
23justice.  Courts and the Department of the Attorney General are considered 
24criminal justice agencies, as is any equivalent agency at any level of Canadian 
25government.
267.  Weapons storage and return.  A law enforcement agency shall store any weapon 
27surrendered to or seized by law enforcement under this section for as long as the threat-
28based restrictions are in effect.  The duties and liability of a law enforcement agency with 
29respect to handling and storage of a weapon surrendered or seized are governed by Title 
3025, section 2804-C, subsection 2-C.  A weapon surrendered to or seized by a law 
31enforcement agency must be returned to the restricted person when the threat-based 
32restrictions expire.  If a seized or surrendered weapon remains unclaimed for 6 months 
33after the expiration or dissolution of threat-based restrictions, the law enforcement agency 
34may dispose of the weapon consistent with Title 25, section 3503-A.
358.  Offense.  Possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person is a Class D 
36crime.

10hours after service of the order on the patient or such earlier time as the court specifies in

30SUMMARY
31Current law authorizes law enforcement to take a person into protective custody for 
32evaluation by a medical practitioner as protection from imminent threats of substantial 
33self-inflicted harm or substantial harm to others.  Part A of this bill requires that a 
34medical practitioner evaluate the history, recent actions and behaviors of a person taken 
35into protective custody and determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
36person's mental health will deteriorate; whether the person will in the foreseeable future 
37pose a likelihood of serious harm; and whether any such likelihood of harm is 
38exacerbated by the person's immediate access to a firearm or other dangerous weapon.  A 
39medical practitioner must certify this evaluation and, if the evaluation is certified in the 
40affirmative, the person is required to surrender any dangerous weapons possessed or 
Page 8 - 129LR2536(01)-11controlled by that person to a law enforcement officer pending a judicial review hearing 
2to be held within 14 days.  A court then determines whether to dissolve or continue those 
3restrictions for one year.  When the person is determined by a court to no longer present a 
4substantial threat, the restrictions end and the weapons are returned.  Part B of this bill 
5requires that a court make similar determinations for a person enrolled in the progressive 
6treatment program. When a person in that program is no longer determined by a court to 
7present a substantial threat, the restrictions end and the weapons are returned.  Part C 
8makes related changes to the laws governing the Extradition and Prosecution Expenses 
9Account; possession of firearms by prohibited persons; law enforcement agency written 
10policy requirements; and law enforcement agency training requirements.
