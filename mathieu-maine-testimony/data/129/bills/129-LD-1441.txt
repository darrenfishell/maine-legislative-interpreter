5SUMMARY
6This bill makes the following changes to the laws affecting dental therapists.
71.  It changes the name of the occupation licensed from "dental hygiene therapist" to 
8"dental therapist" to conform to the name used by other state licensing boards and the 
9American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation.
102.  It identifies the educational requirement as a master's degree in dental therapy.  It 
11also clarifies that a dental therapy program must either be accredited by the American 
12Dental Association Commission on Dental Education or approved by the Board of Dental 
13Practice by rulemaking consistent with the curriculum standards of a dental therapy 
14program as adopted by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental 
15Education.
163.  It requires a provisional dental therapist and a dental therapist to maintain a 
17current certification in advanced cardiac life support.
184.  It clarifies the level of supervision of a provisional dental therapist to require both 
19direct and general supervision as identified in a written practice agreement with a 
20supervising dentist.  It authorizes a dental therapist to practice under the general 
21supervision instead of direct supervision of a dentist pursuant to a written practice 
22agreement.
235.  It removes the practice setting requirements.
