Page 1 - 129LR1630(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §6323, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 521, Pt. C, §1, is 
3further amended to read:
41.  Procedures for all civil actions.  Upon expiration of the period of redemption, if 
5the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successors, heirs or assigns have not redeemed the 
6mortgage, any remaining rights of the mortgagor to possession terminate, and the 
7mortgagee shall cause notice of a public sale of the premises stating the time, place and 
8terms of the sale to be published once in each of 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of 
9general circulation in the county in which the premises are located, the first publication to 
10be made not more than 90 days after the expiration of the period of redemption. Except 
11when otherwise required under 12 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1024.41 or any 
12successor provision, the public sale must be held not less than 30 days nor more than 45 
13days after the first date of that publication. Except for sales of premises that the court has 
14determined to be abandoned pursuant to section 6326, the public sale may be adjourned, 
15for any time not exceeding 7 30 days and from time to time until a sale is made, by 
16announcement to those present at each any such adjournment.  The court, upon motion of 
17the mortgagee, filed before the deadline for sale and showing good cause, may grant such 
18further extensions of the mortgagee's time to sell as it considers appropriate.  For sales of 
19premises that the court has determined to be abandoned pursuant to section 6326, the 
20public sale may be adjourned once for any time not exceeding 7 days, except that the 
21court may permit one additional adjournment for good cause shown.  Adjournments may 
22also be made in accordance with the requirements of 12 Code of Federal Regulations, 
23Section 1024.41 or any successor provision.  The mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may 
24allow the mortgagor to redeem or reinstate the loan after the expiration of the period of 
25redemption but before the public sale.  The mortgagee may shall convey the property to 
26the mortgagor upon redemption or may execute a waiver of foreclosure, and in 
27conjunction with a reinstatement only with the written consent of the mortgagor.  Any 
28waiver and the written consent of the mortgagor must be filed with the court along with a 
29motion to dismiss the foreclosure, and upon such a waiver all other rights of all other 
30parties remain as if no foreclosure had been commenced. The mortgagee shall sell the 
31premises to the highest bidder at the public sale and deliver a deed of that sale and the any 
32writ of possession, if a writ of possession was obtained during the foreclosure process, 
33that has been issued to the purchaser.  The deed conveys the premises free and clear of all 
34interests of the parties in interest joined in the action. The mortgagee or any other party in 
35interest may bid at the public sale.  If the mortgagee is the highest bidder at the public 
36sale, there is no obligation to account for any surplus upon a subsequent sale by the 
37mortgagee. Any rights of the mortgagee to a deficiency claim against the mortgagors are 
38limited to the amount established as of the date of the public sale.  The date of the public 
39sale is the date on which bids are received to establish the sales price, no matter when the 
40sale is completed by the delivery of the deed to the highest bidder.  If the property is 
41conveyed by deed pursuant to a public sale in accordance with this subsection, a copy of 
42the judgment of foreclosure and evidence of compliance with the requirements of this 
43subsection for the notice of public sale and the public sale itself must be attached to or 
44included within the deed, or both, or otherwise be recorded in the registry of deeds.
Page 2 - 129LR1630(01)-11Sec. 2.  14 MRSA §6324,  as amended by PL 2003, c. 20, Pt. T, §10, is further 
2amended by adding at the end a new paragraph to read:
3The report of sale required by this section must be filed with the court within the 
4earlier of 60 days after the public sale and 30 days after the mortgagee's delivery of the 
5deed conveying the mortgaged property to the purchaser at the mortgage sale. Upon a 
6showing of good cause by the mortgagee, made by motion filed before the expiration of 
7the deadline, the court may extend the deadline for the filing of the report of sale for an 
8additional period of time as the court considers appropriate. In the event that the 
9mortgagee fails to timely file the report of sale, the mortgagee has no right to seek a 
10deficiency judgment.
11SUMMARY
12This bill amends the laws governing foreclosure proceedings in order to ensure 
13timely completion of foreclosure sales.  This bill:
141.  Extends the mortgagee's time to sell the property following an adjournment of the

162.  Provides that a mortgagee may execute a waiver of foreclosure only with the 
17written consent of the mortgagor; and
183.  Establishes a time frame for the mortgagee to file a report of sale.
