15Sec. 3.  Power to take water.  The district is authorized to take, hold, divert, use 
16and distribute water from any river, lake, pond, stream, brook, well, spring or other 
17source of water, natural or artificial, within the Town of Canton.
18Sec. 4.  Number of trustees.  The board of trustees of the district is composed of 3 
19trustees.  A trustee must be a resident of the district but need not reside in a household to 
20which the district's service is provided.
21Sec. 5.  Terms of trustees.  A trustee in office at the time of voter approval of this 
22Act shall serve the remainder of that trustee's then-current term.  A trustee must thereafter 
23be elected to a 3-year term pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 
246410, subsection 1.
25Sec. 6.  Authorized to borrow money and to issue bonds and notes.  
26Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 6413, the district, by 
27vote of its board of trustees, without district vote except as provided, is authorized to 
28borrow money temporarily and to issue its negotiable notes, and for the purposes of 
29renewing and refunding the indebtedness so created, of paying necessary expenses and 
30liabilities incurred under the provisions of this Act and of acquiring properties, paying 
31damages, laying pipes, mains and conduits, purchasing, constructing, maintaining and 
32operating a water system and making renewals, additions, extensions and improvements

35authorized to issue, from time to time, bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of 
36the district in such amount or amounts, bearing interest at such rate or rates and having 
37such terms and provisions as the trustees determine. In the case of a vote by the trustees 
38to authorize bonds or notes to pay for the acquisition of property, for the cost of a water 
39system or part of a water system, for renewals or additions or for other improvements in

Page 2 - 129LR2822(01)-11indebtedness or to pay for maintenance, repairs or for current expenses, notice of the 
2proposed debt and of the general purpose or purposes for which it was authorized must be 
3given by the clerk by publication at least once in a newspaper or newsletter having a 
4general circulation in the Town of Canton and mailed to district voters and customers via 
5postcard or bill insert. No debt may be incurred under such vote of the trustees until the 
6expiration of 14 calendar days following the date on which such notice was first 
7published and mailed. Prior to the expiration of that period, the trustees may call a special 
8district meeting for the purpose of permitting the voters of the district to express approval 
9or disapproval of the amount of debt so authorized, and the trustees shall call a special 
10district meeting if, within 14 calendar days following the publication and mailing of the 
11notice, there has been filed with the clerk of the district a petition or petitions signed by 
12not less than 50 qualified voters of the district requesting that such a special district 
13meeting be called. If at the district meeting a majority of voters present and voting 
14thereon expresses disapproval of the amount of debt authorized by the trustees, the debt 
15may not be incurred and the vote of the trustees authorizing the same is void and of no 
16effect.
17The bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness may be issued to mature serially in 
18annual installments of not less than 1% of the face amount of the issue and beginning not 
19later than 2 years from the date of issue, or made to run for such periods as the trustees 
20may determine, but no issue of bonds, notes or evidences of indebtedness may run for a 
21longer period than 40 years from the date of original issue. Bonds, notes or evidences of 
22indebtedness may be issued with or without provision for calling the same prior to 
23maturity and if callable may be made callable at par or at a premium as the trustees may 
24determine. All bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness must have inscribed upon 
25their face the words "Canton Water District," must be signed by the treasurer and 
26countersigned by the chair of the board of trustees of the district and, if coupon bonds are 
27issued, the interest coupons attached to the coupon bonds must bear the facsimile of the 
28signature of the treasurer. All bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness so issued by the 
29district are legal obligations of the district, which is hereby declared to be a quasi-
30municipal corporation within the meaning of Title 30-A, chapter 120.  The district may, 
31from time to time, issue its bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness for the 
32purpose of paying, redeeming or refunding outstanding bonds, notes or evidences of 
33indebtedness, and each authorized issue constitutes a separate loan.  All bonds, notes and 
34evidences of indebtedness issued by the district are legal investments for savings banks in 
35the State of Maine and are tax-exempt.  The district is authorized and empowered to enter 
36into agreements with the State or Federal Government, or any agency of either, or any 
37corporation, commission or board authorized by the State or Federal Government to grant 
38or loan money to or otherwise assist in the financing of projects such as the district is 
39authorized to carry out, and to accept grants and borrow money from any such 
40government agency, corporation, commission or board as may be necessary or desirable 
41to enforce the provisions of this Act.  All notes and bonds with the maturity of more than 
42one year must be first approved by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to Title 35-
43A, section 902.
44Sec. 7.  Referendum; effective date.  This Act takes effect 90 days after 
45adjournment of the Legislature only for the purpose of permitting its submission to the 
46legal voters within the territory described in section 1 at an election called for that 
Page 3 - 129LR2822(01)-11purpose and held on or before December 1, 2021.  Pursuant to the Maine Revised 
2Statutes, Title 30-A, section 2528, the election must be called, advertised and conducted 
3according to the law relating to municipal elections, except that the registrar of voters is 
4not required to prepare or the clerk to post a new list of voters.  For the purpose of 
5registration of voters, the registrar of voters must be in session the secular day preceding 
6the election. The subject matter of this Act is reduced to the following question:
7"Shall An Act To Repeal and Replace the Canton Water District Charter, 
8passed by the 129th Legislature, be accepted?"
9The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or 
10"No" their opinion of the same.
11The results must be declared by the municipal officers of the Town of Canton and 
12due certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State.
13This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a 
14majority of the legal voters voting at the election. Failure to achieve the necessary 
15approval in any referendum does not prohibit subsequent referenda consistent with this 
16section, as long as the referenda are held on or before December 1, 2021.
17SUMMARY
18This bill repeals and replaces the charter of the Canton Water District to update and 
19modernize the district's charter and to clarify that, going forward, the district is to be 
20considered a standard district as that term is defined in the Standard Water District 
21Enabling Act.
