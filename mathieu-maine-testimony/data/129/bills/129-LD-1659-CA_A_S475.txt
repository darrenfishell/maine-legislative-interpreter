This legislation adds persons employed in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on March 1, 2021,

appropriations totaling $3,950,341 and Othe r Special Revenue Funds allocations  totaling $57,219 in fiscal year 2020-

Retirement Allowance Fund with in the Maine Public Employees Retirement System for the increase in the unfunded 
actuarial liability created as a result of the retroactive provis ion in this bill.  Pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, 
Article IX, Section 18-A, unfunded liabilities may not be cr eated except those that result from experience losses. 
General Fund appropriations of $4,770 a nd Other Special Revenue Funds alloca tions of $57,219 in fiscal year 2020-

LR0808(02) - Fiscal Note - Page 1 of 2
It is important to note that this legislation includes a transition provision for those direct care workers hired by DHHS 
prior to March 1, 2021 which allows these employees to elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan by July 1, 2021.  Based on the most current information available, approximately 499 direct care workers will be eligible to make that election.  Because no data was available to estimate how many eligible employees may actully choose to participate in the 1998 Special Plan, this fiscal note assumes 100% participation.  The actual cost of this provision may be less depending on the number of employees that elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan.
If any of the direct care workers hired by DHHS prior to March 1, 2021 who choose to remain in the regular State 
Employee and Teacher Plan eventually retire or otherwise vacate their positions, any newly hired direct care workers will be placed in the 1998 Special Plan.  The additional cost to DHHS to fill these positons at the higher employer contribution rate is estimated to be between $2,000 and $3,000 per position annually.  When this additional cost will be incurred and which fund will be impacted cannot be determined at this time.
