2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA ยง3308, sub-ยง8, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 744, ยง5, is amended 
3to read:
48.  Juvenile records sealed.  This subsection governs the sealing of records of a 
5person adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime.
6A.  A person adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime may petition the court 
7to seal from public inspection all records pertaining to the juvenile crime and its 
8disposition, and to any prior juvenile records and their dispositions if:
9(1)  At least 3 years have passed since the person's discharge from the disposition 
10ordered for that juvenile crime;
11(2)  Since the date of disposition, the person has not been adjudicated to have 
12committed a juvenile crime and has not been convicted of committing a crime; 
13and
14(3)  There are no current adjudicatory proceedings pending for a juvenile or other 
15crime.
16A-1.  At the time that a person adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime is 
17discharged from the disposition ordered for that juvenile crime, the court shall 
18automatically and immediately enter an order sealing from public inspection all 
19records pertaining to the juvenile crime and its disposition.
20B.  The court may grant the petition if it finds that the requirements of paragraph A 
21are satisfied, unless it finds that the general public's right to information substantially 
22outweighs the juvenile's interest in privacy.
23C.  Notwithstanding subsections 3, 3-A, 4 and 5, the court order sealing the records 
24permits only the following persons to have access to the sealed records:
25(1)  The courts and criminal justice agencies as provided by this section; and
26(2)  The person whose juvenile records are sealed or that person's designee.
27D.  If the petition is granted, the A person whose juvenile records have been sealed 
28under this subsection may respond to inquiries from other than the courts and 
29criminal justice agencies about that person's juvenile crimes, the records of which 
30have been sealed, as if the juvenile crimes had never occurred, without being subject 
31to any sanctions.
32SUMMARY
33This bill provides for the sealing of juvenile records.
34The bill changes the sealing process for juvenile records to provide that at the time a 
35person who is adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime is discharged from the 
36disposition ordered for that juvenile crime, the court is required to automatically and 
37immediately enter an order sealing from public inspection all records pertaining to the 
38juvenile crime and its disposition.
