20SUMMARY
21Current law requires the inspection of a subsurface wastewater disposal system on a 
22property located within the shoreland area of the State that is to be transferred.  This bill 
23expands these requirements to apply to the transfer of any property in the State on which 
24a subsurface wastewater disposal system is located.  The bill also amends other 
25provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes as necessary to incorporate these changes.
