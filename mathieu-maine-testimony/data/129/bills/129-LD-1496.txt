2Sec. 1.  PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. EEEEEEE, §§1 and 2 are amended to read:
3Sec. EEEEEEE-1.  Reserve for Riverview Psychiatric Center established. 
4Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the State Controller shall 
5transfer up to $65,000,000 $54,475,183 from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund within 
6the Department of Administrative and Financial Services Tax Relief Fund for Maine 
7Residents to a General Fund reserve account established by the State Controller for the 
8purpose of providing General Fund resources for the amounts in federal financial 
9participation for Medicaid services and disproportionate share hospital payments related

11the Department of Health and Human Services pending a notice and reconsideration of 
12disallowance from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, dated June 7, 
132017.  If there are insufficient funds in the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents to 
14provide the amounts needed, the State Controller shall transfer the amount of the shortage 
15from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund.  Any amount transferred from the Maine 
16Budget Stabilization Fund to make up for the shortage in the Tax Relief Fund for Maine 
17Residents pursuant to this section must be repaid from the Tax Relief Fund for Maine 
18Residents as soon as funds in that fund are available.
19Sec. EEEEEEE-2.  Excess funds. Any remaining balance in the reserve account, 
20established under section 1, upon closure of the pending disallowance must be transferred 
21by the State Controller to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund Tax Relief Fund for 
22Maine Residents.
23Sec. 2.  Transfer.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the State 
24Controller shall transfer $10,524,817 from the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents to 
25the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund within the Department of Administrative and 
26Financial Services no later than 30 days following the effective date of this section.
27SUMMARY
28Under Public Law 2017, chapter 284, Part EEEEEEE, the State Controller is required 
29to transfer up to $65,000,000 from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as 
30the Rainy Day Fund, to provide General Fund resources to cover any federal 
31disallowance in federal financial participation for Medicaid services and disproportionate 
32share hospital payments related to the Riverview Psychiatric Center.  A payment of 
33$10,524,817 was made in early 2019.
34This bill requires instead that the transfer be made from the Tax Relief Fund for 
35Maine Residents and requires the State Controller to reimburse the Rainy Day Fund for 
36the amount transferred for the federal disallowance related to Riverview Psychiatric 
37Center earlier this year.  In the event that sufficient funds do not exist in the Tax Relief 
38Fund for Maine Residents to cover future payments, the funds must come from the Rainy 
39Day Fund, and the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents must be used to reimburse the 
40Rainy Day Fund as soon as funds become available.
