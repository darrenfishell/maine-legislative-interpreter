61.  Definitions.  As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
7following terms have the following meanings.

1435-A, section 102, subsections 19 and 20-B, respectively.
152.  Conditions necessary to ensure public health, safety and welfare.  In order to 
16more appropriately allocate scarce right-of-way space and better control the increase of 
17expenses incurred by municipalities for the provision of services related to and 
18management of rights-of-way necessary to public health, safety and welfare as required 
19by state law, a municipality may impose standards as a condition of a license or permit 
20issued pursuant to Title 35-A, section 2503 to a public right-of-way beneficiary.  
21Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a municipality may require as a 
22condition of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 35-A, section 2503 the payment 
23of a fee necessary to ensure that the costs associated with the public right-of-way 
24beneficiary's use and occupation of the right-of-way are not borne solely by the taxpayers 
25of the municipality.
263.  Alteration, removal or relocation of facilities.  Upon written demand of a 
27municipality, a public right-of-way beneficiary shall alter, remove or relocate, as

31requirement of this chapter is subject to a fine established by ordinance in an amount not 
32to exceed $1,000 per day that the public right-of-way is in violation.  The failure of a

35right-of-way beneficiary.
