Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires the $11.00 per hour minimum wage to increase to $12.00 per hour on January 1, 2020 and by the 
CPI annually beginning on January 1, 2021. This bill repeals those provisions and lowers the minimum wage to 
$10.00 per hour. This reduction in the minimum wage and elimination of the annual cost-of-living increases may 
result in savings to the State and municipalities beginning in fiscal year 2019-20, depending on the wages currently in 
place and decisions on future wages when increases are no longer required by law.
