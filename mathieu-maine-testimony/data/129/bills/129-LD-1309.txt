10adjustments to base year costs to reflect any material difference between as-filed cost 
11reports used in rebasing and subsequent determinations of audited, allowable costs 
12for the same fiscal period.  The department's rules must provide that, beginning in the 
13state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, the rates set for each rebasing year must
