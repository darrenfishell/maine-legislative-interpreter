9business days of the additional information necessary to render a decision.  If the carrier 
10determines that outside consultation is necessary, the carrier shall notify the provider and 
11the enrollee for whom the service was requested within 2 business days.  The carrier shall 
12make a good faith estimate of when the final determination will be made and contact the

31reduces the time frame for a carrier's response to a prior authorization request and it 
32exempts medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder from prior authorization 
33requirements.
34The bill also requires a health insurance carrier to develop an electronic transmission 
35system for prior authorization of prescription drug orders by January 1, 2020 and for 
36medical services by July 1, 2020.
