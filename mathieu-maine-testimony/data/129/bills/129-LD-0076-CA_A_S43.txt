14 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/Jr" to S.P. 29, L.D. 76 (fs lf~) 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
Like the bill, this amendment removes the safe harbor in current law that allows a 
former Legislator to engage in up to 8 hours of lobbying per calendar month without 
violating the prohibition against a former Legislator engaging in compensated lobbying. 
Unlike the bill, which prohibits a foriner Legislator from engaging in compensated 
lobbying activities for 4 years after that Legislator's term ends, the amendment prohibits a 
former Legislator from engaging in compensated lobbying activities for one year after 
that Legislator's term ends. 
The amendment also makes a technical change to the bill to ensure that the 
prohibition against a former Legislator engaging in compensated lobbying does not 
prohibit the former Legislator from engaging in lobbying as an employee of the State or 
of an agency of the State.
