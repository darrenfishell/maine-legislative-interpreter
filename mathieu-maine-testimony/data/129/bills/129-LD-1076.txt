8Sec. 3.  28-B MRSA §1001-A is enacted to read:
9§1001-A.  Excise tax imposed
101.  Determination of average market price.  The department shall establish 
11quarterly the average market price for:
12A.  Marijuana flowers and mature marijuana plants;
13B.  Marijuana trim;
14C.  Immature marijuana plants and seedlings; and
15D.  Marijuana seeds.
162.  Excise tax.  Beginning on the first day of the calendar month in which adult use 
17marijuana may be sold in the State under this chapter, an excise tax is imposed on adult 
18use marijuana sold by a cultivation facility to a licensee in the State that is not vertically 
19integrated with the cultivation facility at the rate of 15% of the average market price for 
20the product sold.
21SUMMARY
22This bill changes the excise tax on adult use marijuana cultivation facilities from a 
23tax based on quantity to a tax based on a percentage of the average market price for the 
24category of marijuana sold.  The bill requires the average market price to be determined 
25quarterly by the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  The tax would not 
26apply to sales by a cultivation facility to a licensee with which it is vertically integrated.
