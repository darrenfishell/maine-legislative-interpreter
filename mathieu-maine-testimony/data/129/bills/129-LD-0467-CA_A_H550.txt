Expanding the periods of conflict in which members of the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Plan who served 
in the armed forces during those periods of conflicts can purchase service credit at a subsidizable rate will increase the 
unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System (MainePERS). Pursuant to the 
Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 18-A, unfunded liabilities may not be created except those that result from 
experience losses. 
Because the number of members who have served in the expanded periods of conflict and how many of those eligible 
members would choose to purchase the additional service credits are not known, MainePERS could not determine the 
actual cost of this provision. However, on average MainePERS receives approximately 8 inquiries per year from 
members in the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Plan who, had this provision been in place, would have been 
eligible to purchase the service credits at the subsidized rate. The subsidized portion of the total cost for the 
additional service credits for those members that requested estimates range from $60,000 to $80,000 per member. 
Assuming 8 members per year purchase service credits each year and that the members are within 10 to 15 years of 
retirement age, the total cost of this provision could range from $5.6 million to $8.4 million, which will need to be 
funded immediately in order to avoid the creation of an unfunded actuarial liability. This bill includes a one-time 
General Fund appropriation of $5,600,000 to the Retirement Allowance Fund within MainePERS to fund the UAL at 
the lower estimated cost. However, additional funding may need to be provided immediately if the actual cost of this 
provision is greater than the funding provided in this bill.
