Page 1 - 129LR1761(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
3amended to read:
41.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 $10.00 per hour.  Starting 
5January 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, 
6the minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum 
7hourly wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage 
8is $12.00 per hour.  On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum 
9hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living. 
10The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as 
11of August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding that year 
12in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for 
13the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States 
14Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount 
15of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  If the highest 
16federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this 
17section, the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same amount, effective 
18on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, and must be increased in 
19accordance with this section thereafter.
20SUMMARY
21This bill sets the minimum wage at $10.00 per hour and removes the provision that 
22requires the minimum wage to be increased annually by the increase, if any, in the cost of 
23living.
