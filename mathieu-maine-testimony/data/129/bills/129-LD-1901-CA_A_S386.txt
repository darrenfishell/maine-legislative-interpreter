Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill makes changes to the laws prohibiting the use of handheld devices while driving, known as the Hands-free 
driving law (PL 2019 c. 486), and clarifies that penalties for violations are $50 for a first offense and $250 for 
subsequent offenses. Previously, fines under the Hands-Free driving law were specified to not be less than these 
amounts with the Courts able to set them higher. The original revenue estimate for violations of the Hands-free 
driving law assumed fines of $50 for the first offense and $250 for subsequent offenses. As a result, there is no 
change in estimated fine revenue at this time.
