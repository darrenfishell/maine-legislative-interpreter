This bill makes changes to rules related to the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) enforcement authority over 
the elvers fishery by clarifying requirements related to use of the swipe card system, the seizure of illegal elvers, use 
of the libel system after seizure and the penalties for failing to comply with DMR regulations. The bill also allows 
the DMR to require inspections of elvers prior to export out of the State and to charge a fee of $500 per inspection. 
The DMR estimates that there are approximately 60 export events per season and that the inspections will start in 
fiscal year 2019-20. The export inspections will generate $30,000 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the 
Eel and Elver Management Fund. The bill includes annual allocations of $30,000 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to 
allow expenditure of the additional revenue collected.
