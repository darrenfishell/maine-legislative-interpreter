FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT .. ;J., to H.P. 1217, L.D. 1702, Bill, "An Act To 
Enhance the Administration of the Maine Human Rights Act" 
Amend the bill in section 7 in §4612 in subsection 6 in the 4th to 8th lines (page 5, 
lines 38 to 42 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "The executive director of the 
commission may issue a right-to-sue letter in any case in which the commission has not 
filed a civil action in the case or has not entered into a conciliation agreement in the case 
within 180 days of the complaint being filed, whether or not such a letter has been 
requested by the complainant." 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
The bill authorizes the executive director of the Maine Human Rights Commission to 
issue a right-to-sue letter without a request. This amendment removes that authority from 
the bill.

The bill makes several changes to the Maine Human Rights Act to improve processing and investigating complaints. 
In addition to these changes, the bill exempts funds collected by the Maine Human Rights Commission for 3rd-party 
neutral mediation from the statewide cost allocation plan (STACAP). STACAP charges are assessed to state programs 
in order to recover some of the costs of providing central administrative services paid by the General Fund. 
Exempting certain accounts from STACAP charges removes the ability to distribute overhead costs to non-general 
fund accounts. It is estimated that the Maine Human Rights Commission is assessed about $3,000 annually in 
STACAP charges for funds collected for 3rd party mediation. As a result, the bill will reduce revenues credited to the 
General Fund by $3,000 annually.
