Page 4 - 129LR0016(01)-11capable of operating at 69 kilovolts or more.  A minor transmission line construction 
2project is a transmission line construction project the cost of which does not exceed 25% 
3of the utility's current annual transmission property depreciation charge.  The schedule 
4must describe each project, showing the length, location and estimated cost.
5If the commission determines that an investigation of any minor transmission line 
6construction project is warranted, it shall notify the transmission and distribution utility 
7within 60 days of the annual filing and the utility must then comply with the provisions of 
8this section with respect to that project.  The absence of commission notification

Page 5 - 129LR0016(01)-11nonwires alternatives that are identified as able to address the identified need for the 
2proposed transmission or distribution project at lower total cost to ratepayers. Of the 
3identified nontransmission nonwires alternatives, the commission shall give preference to 
4the lowest-cost nontransmission nonwires alternatives. When the costs to ratepayers of 
5the identified nontransmission nonwires alternatives are reasonably equal, the 
6commission shall give preference to the alternatives that produce the lowest amount of 
7local air emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions.
83.  Exception.  A transmission or distribution project that is constructed, owned and 
9operated by a generator of electricity solely for the purpose of electrically and physically 
10interconnecting the generator to the transmission system of a transmission and

Page 6 - 129LR0016(01)-118.  Cost recovery. The commission shall, upon petition, permit a transmission and 
2distribution utility to adjust its rates to recover the utility's prudently incurred incremental 
3costs associated with the operations of the nonwires alternative coordinator, costs of 
4procuring nonwires alternatives and otherwise implementing smart grid functions and 
5associated infrastructure, technology and applications or otherwise taking reasonable 
6actions consistent with the policies of this section, to the extent that the costs are not 
7already reflected in the utility's rates and the adjustment does not result in rates that are 
8unjust or unreasonable. A grant by a utility in an amount approved by the commission to 
9the University of Maine System for smart grid research and development is deemed to be 
10a prudently incurred an incremental cost associated with implementing smart grid 
11functions.
129.  Report.  The commission, as part of its annual report pursuant to section 120, In 
13the annual report required under section 1702, the Public Advocate shall include a report 
14on the progress of the State in achieving the purposes of this section. The commission 
15Public Advocate may include in its report any recommendations for changes to law to 
16promote the purposes of this section.
1710.  Consumer education.  A If a transmission and distribution utility that or the 
18Efficiency Maine Trust implements smart grid functions, the utility or the trust shall, to 
19the extent the commission determines appropriate, provide information to customers 
20about the purpose and goals of smart grid functions, the ways in which smart grid 
21functions, including but not limited to time-of-use pricing, may involve customer 
22interaction and how the implementation of smart grid functions can benefit customers. 
23Sec. 17.  35-A MRSA §10104, sub-§4, ¶G is enacted to read:
24G.  In developing the triennial plan, or an annual update plan under subsection 6, the 
25trust may include, as part of its budget for electric efficiency and conservation 
26programs under section 10110, the costs of providing nonwires alternatives in 
27accordance with a procurement plan for nonwires alternatives under section 1701, 
28subsection 2-A.
29SUMMARY
30This bill establishes the position of nonwires alternative coordinator in the Office of 
31the Public Advocate. The duties of the nonwires alternative coordinator include 
32investigation and identification of nonwires alternatives to proposed transmission lines 
33and proposed transmission projects and evaluation of the costs and benefits of nonwires 
34alternatives compared to utility capital investments in the transmission and distribution 
35system.  The bill requires the nonwires alternative coordinator to include and collaborate 
36with transmission and distribution utilities, the Efficiency Maine Trust and interested 
37parties in conducting the coordinator's review and analysis of proposed utility capital 
38investments and nonwires alternatives.  The duties of the coordinator also include making 
39recommendations for nonwires alternatives to the Public Utilities Commission, proposing 
40procurement plans for nonwires alternatives and implementing procurement plans 
41approved by the commission.  The bill specifies that a procurement plan for nonwires 
42alternatives may provide for the Efficiency Maine Trust to procure and deliver, through 
Page 7 - 129LR0016(01)-11its existing programs, nonwires alternatives, and it authorizes the Efficiency Maine Trust, 
2in its triennial plan or annual update plan, to include the costs of providing nonwires 
3alternatives in its budget for electric efficiency and conservation programs.
4The bill amends the law governing the construction of transmission lines and the 
5construction of transmission or distribution projects by transmission and distribution 
6utilities.  It defines a transmission or distribution project as a transmission or distribution 
7line operating at less than 69 kilovolts projected to cost over $500,000; current law 
8defines a transmission project as a transmission line operating at less than 69 kilovolts 
9projected to cost over $20,000,000.   The bill requires the nonwires alternative 
10coordinator to conduct an investigation of proposed transmission lines and proposed 
11transmission or distribution projects prior to approval of any line or project by the Public 
12Utilities Commission.  It requires the commission to consider the results of the 
13investigation conducted by and the recommendations of the nonwires alternative 
14coordinator regarding nonwires alternatives to the proposed transmission line or 
15transmission or distribution project.
16The bill requires each transmission and distribution utility to file an annual schedule 
17of transmission line rebuilding or relocation projects and minor transmission line 
18construction projects with the nonwires alternative coordinator in addition to with the 
19Public Utilities Commission.  It also establishes a requirement for each transmission and 
20distribution utility to prepare and file annually with the commission and the nonwires 
21alternative coordinator a distribution system planning study describing system capacity 
22and load and growth-related needs for the upcoming 5 years to ensure electric grid 
23reliability.
24The bill makes several changes to the law on smart grid infrastructure policy.  It 
25establishes that it is in the public interest to establish a nonwires alternative coordinator 
26for the State. It allows utilities to adjust rates to recover incremental costs associated with 
27operations of the nonwires alternative coordinator and costs of procuring nonwires 
28alternatives and eliminates the requirement that incremental costs be prudently incurred 
29to be recoverable.  It requires the Public Advocate's annual report to include a report on 
30the State's progress on smart grid infrastructure.
