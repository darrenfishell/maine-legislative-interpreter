8§1054.  Taxable bond option
9With respect to all or any portion of any issue of any bonds or any series of bonds 
10that the authority may issue in accordance with the limitations and restrictions of this 
11subchapter, the authority may covenant and consent that the interest on the bonds is 
12includable, under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any subsequent 
13corresponding internal revenue law of the United States, in the gross income of the 
14holders of the bonds to the same extent and in the same manner that the interest on bills, 
15bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of 
16the holders under the United States Internal Revenue Code or any subsequent law. Bonds 
17issued pursuant to this section are not subject to any limitations or restrictions of any law 
18that may limit the authority's power to issue those bonds or to the procedures set forth in 
19section 1043 or in section 1044, subsections 1, 11 and 12; except that the procedures set 
20forth in section 1043 do apply with respect to major business expansion projects.  The 
21foregoing grant of power may not be construed as limiting the inherent power of the State 
22or its agencies under any other provision of law to issue debt, the interest on which is 
23includable in the gross income of the holders of the interest under the United States 
24Internal Revenue Code or any subsequent law.  Any action or proceeding in any court to

28within 30 days after the date on which the members of the authority adopt a formal 
29resolution approving issuance of the securities and otherwise must be governed by Title 
305, chapter 375, subchapter VII 7.  Once the authority has adopted a resolution to approve 
31the issuance of securities pursuant to this section, any action by the authority to amend, 
32alter or revise the resolution may not commence a new period of time within which any 
33such action or proceeding may be commenced.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 
34969-A, subsection 11 and Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter VII 7, including, but not 
35limited to, Title 5, sections 11002 and 11003, any such action or proceeding may be 
36commenced only by first serving the petition for review upon the authority, in hand, 
37within that 30-day period.  After the expiration of the 30-day period of limitation, no right 
38of action or defense founded upon the invalidity of the resolution or contesting any 
39provision of the resolution, any amendment to the resolution or the issuance of the 
40securities may be started or asserted nor may the resolution or the issuance of the 
41securities be open to question in any court upon any grounds.
42Sec. 9.  24-A MRSA §2303-B, last ¶, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 500, §7, is 
43amended to read:
Page 4 - 129LR1067(01)-11For purposes of this section, "clean fuel vehicle" has the same meaning as set out in 
2Title 10, section 963-A, subsection 5-B means a vehicle that may be propelled by a clean 
3fuel or a fuel-cell electric vehicle that uses any fuel.  For purposes of this paragraph, 
4"clean fuel" means all products or energy sources used to propel motor vehicles, as 
5defined in Title 29-A, section 101, other than conventional gasoline, diesel or 
6reformulated gasoline, that, when compared to conventional gasoline, diesel or 
7reformulated gasoline, result in lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic 
8compounds, carbon monoxide or particulates or any combination of these. "Clean fuel"

10petroleum gas; hydrogen; hythane, which is a combination of compressed natural gas and 
11hydrogen; dynamic flywheels; solar energy; alcohol fuels containing not less than 85%

13SUMMARY
14This bill amends the Finance Authority of Maine Act by removing various references 
15to bond financing for major business expansion projects and eliminating that financing.  It 
16also reallocates the bonding authority for securing the Finance Authority of Maine's 
17capital reserve funds supporting other programs.  It also removes definitions pertaining to 
18the Clean Fuel Vehicle Fund, which was repealed in 2013.
