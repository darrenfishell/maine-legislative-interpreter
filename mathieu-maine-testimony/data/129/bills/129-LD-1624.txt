Page 1 - 129LR1873(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §353, first ¶, as amended by PL 2015, c. 297, §20, is further 
3amended to read:
4An employee may not be discriminated against by any employer in any way for 
5testifying or asserting any claim or right under this Act.  It is a violation of this section if 
6the fact that an employee testifies or asserts a claim or right under this Act against an 
7employer constitutes any portion of the basis upon which an employer disciplines or 
8terminates the employee or discriminates against the employee in any way.  Any 
9employee who is so discriminated against may file a petition alleging a violation of this 
10section.  The matter must be referred to an administrative law judge for a formal hearing 
11under section 315, but any administrative law judge who has previously rendered any 
12decision concerning the claim must be excluded.  If the employee prevails at this hearing, 
13the administrative law judge may award the employee reinstatement to the employee's 
14previous job, payment of back wages, reestablishment of employee benefits and 
15reasonable attorney's fees.
16SUMMARY
17Current law provides that an employer may not discriminate against an employee for 
18asserting a workers' compensation claim.  In Maietta v. Town of Scarborough, 2004 ME 
1997, 854 A.2d 223, the Law Court interpreted this provision as prohibiting discrimination 
20against an employee only if the assertion of the workers' compensation claim was the 
21primary basis or cause for the employer's adverse action against the employee. This bill 
22amends the law to specify that if an employee's assertion of a workers' compensation 
23claim or right constitutes any part of the basis upon which an employer decides to 
24discipline or terminate an employee, it is a violation of the prohibition.
