29town, plantation or township in which the marijuana store is located authorizes the 
30operation of delivery services and the marijuana store receives approval to operate the 
31delivery service from the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  A 
32marijuana store is allowed to maintain a separate storage facility approved by the 
33department in which to store product or from which to conduct delivery service 
34operations and which may be located in the same municipality as the retail facility of the 
35marijuana store or another municipality subject to the approval of the other municipality.  
36Delivery services are subject to the same testing, tracking, labelling and packaging 
37requirements as retail sales of adult use marijuana and marijuana products, delivery 
38service drivers are subject to the same requirements as the employees of a marijuana 
39store, delivery recipients are subject to the same customer restrictions regarding age and 
40state of intoxication as marijuana store customers and delivery service vehicles are 
Page 9 - 129LR1888(01)-11subject to the same inspection requirements as the marijuana store's licensed premises and 
2may not have an occupant under 21 years of age during the course of a delivery.
