8SUMMARY
9This bill, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, requires payment of a 
10tax equalization assessment if a tax family has an expanded income of at least $250,000 
11for a tax family filing as a single individual, $325,000 for a tax family filing as a head of 
12a household or $400,000 for a tax family filing a married joint return or filing a joint 
13return as a surviving spouse, and an effective tax rate that is less than the average 
14effective tax rate on state and local taxes paid by the bottom 99% of tax families. The tax 
15equalization assessment is an amount equal to the difference in the average effective tax 
16rate on state and local taxes paid, calculated by decile, and a tax family's individual 
17effective tax rate on state and local taxes paid, the sum of which is multiplied by a tax 
18family's expanded income.
19This bill also, for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2020, increases the 
20total amount of the Maine resident homestead property tax exemption by $5,000 to 
21$25,000 of the just value of the homestead.  Finally, this bill increases the earned income 
22tax credit from 5% of the federal earned income tax credit to 10% of the federal earned 
23income tax credit and reduces the threshold amount from 6% to 5% to qualify for the 
24property tax fairness credit.
