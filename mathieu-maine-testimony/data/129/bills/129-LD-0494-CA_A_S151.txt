29 practical matter to many persons in this Statet,. that unwanted oonoeptioa pregnancy may 
30 place severe medical, emotional, social and economic burdens on the family unit and that 
31 it is desirable that inhibitions and restrictions to the delivery of family planning services 
32 be reduced so that all persons desiring and needing such services shall have ready and 
33 practicable access therete to the services in appropriate settings sensitive to their persons' 
34 needs and beliefs. The Legislature therefore declares that it is consistent with public

prevention services or treatment or collection from informing the parent or guardian. For 
2 purposes of this section, "substance use" means the use of drugs or alcohol solely for their

7 section number to read consecutively. 
8 SUMMARY 
9 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the bill to 
10 remove conflicts with other provisions in statute relating to consent by minors. Current 
11 law provides that the treatment of a minor for a sexually transmitted infection does not 
12 require the consent of the minor's parent or guardian. This amendment provides that the 
13 prevention or treatment of a sexually transmitted infection does not require the consent of 
14 the minor's parent or guardian. Current law also provides that family planning services 
15 may be provided to a minor who is a parent, who is married, with the consent of the 
16 minor's guardian or if the minor will suffer probable health hazards. This amendment 
17 provides that a health care provider may provide family planning services to a minor 
18 without requiring the consent of the minor's parent or guardian, just as with sexually 
19 transmitted infections. This amendment clarifies that the provisions of the Maine 
20 Revised Statutes, Title 22, chapter 406 regarding family planning services are not 
21 intended to change the scope of practice of a health care provider. It also makes other 
22 technical changes.
