Fiscal Note 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -All Funds 
This bill provides that during the interim between the expiration of a state employee collective bargaining agreement 
and before the effective date of any subsequent collective bargaining agreement (CBA) state employees covered by 
the expired agreement must receive merit increases in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the 
expired agreement. Assuming merit increases would not be granted in the absence of this bill, these increases would 
represent a cost to state departments and agencies. No estimate of this cost is available at this time and no funding is 
provided in the bill. The Governor's proposed budget for the 2020-2021 biennium, LD 1001, includes funding for 
merit increases in anticipation of a CBA being in place.
