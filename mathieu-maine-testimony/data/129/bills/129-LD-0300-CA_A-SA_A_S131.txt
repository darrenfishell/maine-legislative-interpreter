Fiscal Detail and Notes 
As school administrative units (SAU's) have payroll systems with the capability ofrecording and tracking certain 
payment options for salaried employees, it is anticipated that those systems will be able to provide the same 
functionality for hourly employees without additional programming or modification. This amendment removes the 
mandate preamble.
