LD 30 LR 766 (02)
Fiscal Detail and Notes
The bill also establishes the Maine Health Data Organizati on Health Information Trend Advisory Committee. Costs to 
the MHDO, the Bureau of Insurance, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and the DHHS to serve on the committee are expected to be minimal and can  be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. This bill requires the Maine Health Data Organization (M HDO) and the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) to develop a mu lti-payer provider database and service locator t ool, with any associated costs to be absorbed 
by the DHHS within existing budgeted resources or through grant funding. The development and implementation of this tool is being funded by a $2 million federal grant wh ich expires on 03/29/21. The on-going operating cost for the 
tool is estimated to be $250,000 annually and currently there is no funding for the on-going cost. If the DHHS is not able to secure additional grant funding, the impact of this new unfunded cost on other programs in the DHHS could be significant.Fiscal Note
