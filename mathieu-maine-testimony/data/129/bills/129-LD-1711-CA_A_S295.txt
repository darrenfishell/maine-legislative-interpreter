2 credits under section 3485, subsection 2; and 
3 (2) For a shared distributed generation resources procurement, demonstration of 
4 experiencing fulfilling the obligation to subscribers of shared distributed 
5 generation resources. 
6 The commission may by rule require a bidder to pay a reasonable bidding fee to defray 
7 administrative costs. 
8 5. Ensuring competition. Prior to each solicitation under subsections 1 to 3, the 
9 commission shall establish standards to ensure that the solicitation has a sufficient 
10 number of unique bidders and quantity of qualified bids to be determined competitive. If 
11 the commission concludes that a solicitation is not competitive, the commission may 
12 reduce the target procurement quantities to produce the greatest quantity that may be 
13 procured consistent with this subsection and shall defer to subsequent solicit.ations the 
14 capacity reduced in the solicitation. 
15 6. Bid selection. Following a review of bids received in the solicitations under 
16 subsections 1 to 3, and after any adjustment to the target quantity under subsection 5, the 
17 commission shall select one or more winning bids that, in the aggregate, meet the target 
18 procurement quantity. If there are multiple qualified bids at the same offer rate, the 
19 commission shall give preference to the qualified bid or bids that minimize the cost to the 
20 standard buyers or, ifthere is no difference in cost, to the bid that was submitted first.

34 the extent commercially reasonable. 
35 A qualified project must be commercially operable within 18 months of being awarded a 
36 contract. The commission may grant an extension for good cause. If a project fails to 
37 meet a milestone, the project sponsor is in default and the sponsor's contract must be 
38 cancelled. The capacity associated with a cancelled project must be added to the 
39 currently open procurement block. If procurement block 5 has been filled and 
40 procurements closed, the defaulted quantity must be added to procurement block 5 and 
41 new offers must be accepted under subsection 2.

1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment: 
3 1. Changes the net energy billing law to: 
4 a. Allow a customer to participate if the customer has a financial interest in a 
5 distributed generation resource, which is defined as a generator with a capacity of 
6 less than 5 megawatts that uses a renewable resource and is located in the service 
7 territory of a transmission and distribution utility in this State; 
8 b. Permit any number of customers of an investor-owned transmission and 
9 distribution utility to share the financial interest, except in the northern Maine grid, 
10 where the limit is 10, unless the Public Utilities Commission finds the utility system 
11 can accommodate a higher number; and 
12 c. Add a new commercial and institutional net energy billing program that provides 
13 for a tariff rate for the energy exported by the distributed generation resource that is 
14 based on the applicable standard offer rate for the customer plus a percentage of the 
15 transmission and distribution utility rate for a specific class of customers; 
16 2. Requires the Public Utilities Commission to report on metering and billing issues 
17 to the joint standing committee on utilities and energy and to evaluate net energy billing 
18 when certain events occur; and 
19 3. Creates a requirement for the procurement of distributed generation resources by 
20 each investor-owned electric utility, or by a separate buyer, if one is designated by the 
21 commission. The amendment: 
22 a. Directs procurements of 125 megawatts of output associated with commercial and 
23 institutional accounts and 250 megawatts of shared distributed generation resources 
24 to be achieved by July 1, 2024; 
25 b. Directs that procurements must be through a competitive bidding process with 
26 solicitations for certain blocks of output and contract rates, after the first block, set in 
27 declining relation to the previous block; 
28 c. Provides procedures to address cases of under-procurement for any block; 
29 d. Requires subscriptions to certain portions of shared distributed generation 
30 resources to satisfy certain minimum requirements related to the types and sizes of 
31 subscribers or subscriptions; and 
32 e. Provides for consumer protections and transparency requirements. 
33 4. Adds an appropriations and allocations section.

This bill makes changes to the laws regarding net energy billing, adds additional reporting requirements for the 
Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and creates requirements for the procurement of distributed generation resources. 
The PUC has indicated that the changes to net energy billing rules and distributed generation requirements of the bill 
will require additional staff and resources to complete. This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations 
of $334,983 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $451,658 in fiscal year 2020-21 for two Utility Analyst positions, one Staff 
Attorney position and associated position costs. The bill also includes ongoing allocations of $400,000 beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20 for contracted consulting services. 
The PUC is funded by an assessment set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the 
Legislature for operating the PUC. The increased allocations in this bill require a corresponding increase in revenue 
from the assessment on transmission and distribution utilities. These costs may eventually be passed on to customers 
through scheduled rate cases.
