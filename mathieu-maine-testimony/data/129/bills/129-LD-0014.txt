28A.  The rating must be based on standards of professional practice and measures of 
29educator effectiveness.  The proportionate weight of the standards and the measures 
30is a local decision, but measurements of student learning and growth must be a 
31significant factor in the determination of the rating of an educator.  School 
32administrative units shall use state assessment growth data for English language arts, 
33literacy, science and mathematics as at least one measure of the performance of 
34English language arts, science and mathematics teachers in tested grades and as a 
35measure for the performance of principals.

37receive an annual summative effectiveness evaluation and rating until the rating 
38improves.
39An individualized education plan may not be used to measure student growth for the 
40purposes of teacher and principal evaluation, but an individualized education plan 
41may be a source of evidence from which learning objectives and learning targets may 
42be developed.
