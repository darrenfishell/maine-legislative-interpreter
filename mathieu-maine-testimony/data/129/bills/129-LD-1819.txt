11requirements of this section.

13adjustments required to be reported and the tax paid under subsection 1, the proper 
14reporting of final federal adjustments and payment of amounts due by a partnership under 
15subsections 3 and 4 relieves the partners of the partnership of any tax liability resulting 
16from their distributive shares of the adjustments so reported.  The direct partners or 
17indirect partners may not take any deduction or credit for this amount or claim a refund of 
18the amount in this State.
196.  Failure of audited partnership or tiered partner to report or pay.  Nothing in

28partners; or

30assessor.

33sections 141 and 5270 and the period for filing a claim for refund or credit of taxes 
34pursuant to sections 144 and 5278 arising from the final federal adjustment.
