Fiscal Note
State Mandate - Funded
Required Activity
This bill expands the number of municipal officials required to complete freedom of 
access training to include code enforcement officers, town and city managers, administrators and planning board members.  It requires deputies of various officials 
complete the training. School superintende nts, assistant superintendents and school 
board members are also required to complete the training.
The required local activities in this bill may represent a stat e mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of th e Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state ma ndate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities.
