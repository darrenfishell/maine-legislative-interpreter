15 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and the title. It specifies

17 minimum or maximum size limits on shellfish regulated by the ordinance as long as those 
18 limits established are no less stringent than any minimum or maximum size limit set in 
19 law or rule, except it requires that an ordinance must establish minimum size limits for 
20 soft-shell clams that are at least as strict as those limits established in the Maine Revised 
21 Statutes, Title 12, section 6681. Lastly, it also clarifies that enforcement of any provision 
22 adopted in any ordinance is enforceable only in the municipality in which the harvesting 
23 of the shellfish occurs.
