4When the defendant is defaulted or fails to show sufficient cause, judgment must be

6Seven calendar days after the judgment is entered, the court shall issue the writ of 
7possession to remove the defendant.  The writ may be served by a sheriff or a constable.  
8If at least 3 2 good faith efforts on 3 2 different days have been made to serve the 
9defendant, service may be accomplished by both mailing the notice by first-class mail to 
10the defendant's last known address and leaving the writ of possession at the defendant's 
11last and usual place of abode.  A writ of possession may not issue in any case in which 
12the ground for termination of the tenancy at will was rent arrearage and the defendant 
13paid the amount necessary to reinstate the tenancy as provided by section 6002.
14SUMMARY
15Current law requires that a sheriff or constable serving a writ of possession in an 
16eviction must make 3 good faith efforts on 3 different days to serve the defendant in 
17person before the writ of possession may be left at the defendant's home and a notice 
18mailed.  This bill reduces the number of efforts required to 2.
