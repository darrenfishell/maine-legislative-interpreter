35applications filed before April 1, 1991.  The bill modifies the program to include 
36households with at least one individual who is 65 years of age or older or who is unable 
37to continue employment due to disability and to surviving spouses who are at least 60 
38years of age or who are unable to continue employment due to disability and provides 
39that income must be less than $40,000.  This income limit is indexed for inflation in 2021 
Page 5 - 129LR0692(01)-11and annually thereafter.  The bill also changes the rate of accrual of interest on deferred 
2property taxes from 6% to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal rounded up 
3to the next whole percent minus one percentage point.  The bill adds a maximum liquid 
4asset standard for eligibility of property owners and provides that property may not be 
5subject to deferral under both the state deferral program and a municipal deferral 
6program.
