This bill establishes the Securities Restitution Assistance Fund to provide financial assistance to victims of securities 
violations. The bill directs the State Controller to transfer $350,000 from the available balance in the Office of 
Securities Other Special Revenue Funds account to the fund. A revenue stream that already exists within the 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation (DPFR) from civil fines ordered or agreed to by the 
administrator, a portion of broker dealer agent and investment adviser representative renewal fees and any grants, 
donations or other money received by the administrator for victim restitution assistance will now be redirected to the 
new fund. The DPFR anticipates that $650,000 will be credited to the fund on an annual basis. Of this amount, 
$75,000 is being redirected from the General Fund and the rest is being redirected from Other Special Revenue Funds 
in theDPFR. 
The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $650,000 annually to the DPFR beginning in fiscal year 
2019-20.
