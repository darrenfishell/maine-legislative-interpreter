8The full amount of the credit may be claimed by the qualified taxpayer against the 
9qualified taxpayer's taxes imposed by Part 8 for each taxable year of the credit period.
102.  Allocation certificate.  The authority shall allocate a credit to a qualified taxpayer 
11by issuing to the taxpayer an allocation certificate.  The authority may determine the time

13the context clearly requires otherwise, the authority shall determine eligibility for a credit 
14and allocate credits in accordance with the standards and requirements set forth in Section 
1542 of the Code.  The credit must be in an amount determined by the authority, subject to 
16the following:
17A.  The credit must be necessary for the financial feasibility of the qualified 
18development;
19B.  The credit may not exceed the amount of the federal tax credit awarded to the 
20qualified taxpayer.  Notwithstanding that the federal tax credit is claimed over 10 
21years, the state credit must be claimed over the 6-year credit period.  An annual credit 
22may exceed the annual federal tax credit for any year of the credit period;

30taxpayers and, if there are multiple tiers of pass-through entities, the credit may be 
31allocated through any number of pass-through entities in any manner agreed to by the 
32owners of the pass-through entities. An allocation of a credit through multiple pass-
33through entities under this subsection is not a transfer.  The qualified taxpayer shall 
34certify to the State Tax Assessor the amount of credit allocated to each constituent 
35taxpayer or shall notify the State Tax Assessor that the qualified taxpayer has assigned 
36the duty of certification to a constituent taxpayer, and the constituent taxpayer shall 
37provide the certification to the State Tax Assessor.  Each constituent taxpayer may claim 
38as a credit against the taxpayer's tax under Part 8 the certified amount allocated under this 
39subsection to the constituent taxpayer subject to any restrictions in this chapter.
404.  Recorded restrictive covenant; compliance with federal requirements.  The 
41authority may not allocate a credit pursuant to this section unless the qualified taxpayer:
Page 3 - 129LR2047(01)-11A.  Subjects the qualified development to a recorded restrictive covenant requiring 
2the development to be maintained and operated as a qualified development during the 
3compliance period; and
4B.  Beginning with the first taxable year of the compliance period or a longer period 
5agreed to between the authority and the qualified taxpayer, ensures the compliance of 
6the qualified development with the accessibility and adaptability requirements of the 
7federal tax credits and Title VIII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended 
8by the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.
95.  Application of credit.  A credit may be taken against the taxes imposed by Part 8 
10for each taxable year of the credit period.  Any amount of a credit that exceeds the tax 
11due for a taxable year may be carried forward as a tax credit against subsequent years' tax 
12liability for up to 11 tax years following the tax year in which the allocation was made 
13and must be applied first to the earliest years possible.  Any amount of the credit that is 
14not used may not be refunded to the taxpayer.
156.  Aggregate amount of credits.  The aggregate amount of all credits allocated by 
16the authority in each calendar year may not exceed the total of:
17A.  Forty-two million dollars for credits allocated pursuant to subsection 2 and 
18section 6705;
19B.  An amount totaling all unallocated credits, if any, for the preceding calendar 
20years; and
21C.  Any credit recaptured under section 6703 or otherwise returned to the authority in 
22the calendar year.
23§6703.  Recapture of credit
241.  Recapture of credit.  On the last day of any taxable year during the compliance 
25period, if the amount of the qualified basis of a qualified development is less than the 
26amount of the qualified basis on the last day of the prior taxable year, then the amount of 
27the qualified taxpayer's tax liability under Part 8 for that taxable year must be increased 
28by the credit recapture amount under subsection 2.
292.  Recapture amount.  The credit recapture amount is an amount equal to the 
30aggregate decrease in the credit allowed to the qualified taxpayer for all prior taxable 
31years that would have resulted if the accelerated portion of the credit under subsection 3 
32were not allowed for all prior taxable years with respect to the reduced amount of 
33qualified basis under subsection 1.
343.  Accelerated portion of credit.  The accelerated portion of the credit for the prior 
35taxable years for any amount of qualified basis is the difference between:
36A.  The aggregate credit allowed under this chapter, not including this subsection, for 
37the years with the qualified basis; and
38B.  The aggregate credit that would be allowable under this chapter for the years with 
39the qualified basis if the aggregate credit that would have been allowable, not 
Page 4 - 129LR2047(01)-11including this subsection, for the entire compliance period were allowable ratably 
2over 15 years.
34.  Reporting of capture of credit.  If the recapture of any credit under this section is 
4required in any tax year, the qualified taxpayer must report on the taxpayer's return 
5submitted to the State Tax Assessor for that tax year the proportion of credit required to 
6be recaptured, the identity of each taxpayer subject to the recapture and the amount of 
7credit previously allocated to each taxpayer.

13allocated the credit to constituent taxpayers under section 6702, subsection 3, a copy of 
14the certification to the department for the allocation of the credit among the constituent 
15taxpayers. A person that has received a portion of a credit as a constituent taxpayer under

22under Part 8 and is otherwise eligible to claim a credit under this chapter may claim and

16SUMMARY
17This bill creates a tax credit for owners of low-income housing developments that 
18qualify for tax credits under federal law and are financed with tax-exempt bonds, located 
19in the State and determined by the Maine State Housing Authority to be eligible for a 
20federal tax credit whether or not a federal tax credit is allocated to the development. A 
21taxpayer that receives the credit must agree to enter a restrictive covenant to maintain and 
22operate the development as low-income housing and follow various federal requirements 
23for 15 years.  The state tax credit is for 6 years and has a recapture provision if the basis, 
24as determined under federal law, of the development goes below a certain amount.  An 
25insurance company is allowed to apply the credit against the company's insurance 
26premium tax.  The Maine State Housing Authority is required annually to report various 
27details of the qualified developments that received a credit for the prior tax year.
