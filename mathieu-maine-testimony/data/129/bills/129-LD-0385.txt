5subsection establishes full-value education mill rates that limit a municipality's required 
6local contribution pursuant to section 15688, subsection 3-A.  The full-value mill rates 
7represent rates that, if applied to the statewide valuation, would produce the statewide 
8total local share.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to the 
9assessment of any property taxes for property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 
102005, a municipality's required local contribution determined pursuant to section 15688, 
11subsection 3-A establishes the local cost share expectation for that municipality.
12A.  Based on the funding requirements established in section 15671, the 
13commissioner shall annually by February 1st notify each school administrative unit of 
14its local cost share expectation and tabulate that local cost share expectation, total 
15allocation and the projected state subsidy for each school administrative unit and post 
16those tabulations, itemized by school administrative unit, on the department's publicly 
17accessible website.  Each superintendent shall report to the municipal officers

19a change made in the local cost share expectation resulting from an adjustment.
20B.  For property tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2005, the commissioner shall

22local share.  The full-value education mill rate is calculated for each fiscal year by 
23dividing the applicable statewide total local share by the applicable statewide 
24valuation.  The full-value education mill rate must decline over the period from fiscal 
25year 2005-06 to fiscal year 2008-09 and may not exceed 9.0 mills in fiscal year 2005-

24SUMMARY
25This bill amends the method by which the share of the total cost of education from 
26kindergarten to grade 12 is calculated for a municipality that is within a regional school 
27unit. Current law establishes that share as the lesser of the municipality's total cost of 
28education as determined under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, section 15688, 
29subsection 1 and an amount equal to the product of the education mill rate for the 
30municipality multiplied by the total valuation of property in the municipality. This bill 
31instead determines the share of the total cost of education from kindergarten to grade 12 
32of a municipality within a regional school unit based upon the product of the statewide 
33per-pupil rate calculated under Title 20-A, section 15671-A, subsection 2-A and the 
34number of pupils in the municipality who reside in the municipality and who are educated 
35at public expense. The bill phases in this method of determining a municipality's share of 
36the total cost of education from kindergarten to grade 12 over 3 years: in fiscal year 2020-
3721, the total cost is 2/3 of the amount determined based on property values and 1/3 of the 
38amount determined based on number of pupils; in fiscal year 2021-22, the total cost is 1/3 
39of the amount determined based on property values and 2/3 of the amount determined 
40based on number of pupils; and, in fiscal year 2022-23 and subsequent years, the total 
41cost is determined based entirely on number of pupils.
