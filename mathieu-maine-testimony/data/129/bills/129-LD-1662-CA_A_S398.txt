9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" ~ "to S.P. 539, L.D. 1662, Bill, "An Act To Save 
10 Lives by Establishing the Low Barrier Opioid Treatment Response Program" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'Resolve, To Save Lives by Establishing the Low Barrier Opioid Treatment 
13 Response Pilot Project within the Department of Health and Human Services' 
14 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
15 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
16 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
17 Whereas, opioid use disorder has reached epidemic proportions and threatens the 
18 lives and well-being of many Maine residents; and 
19 Whereas, existing modalities and strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder are 
20 insufficient to end the epidemic of this disorder in Maine; and 
21 Whereas, existing services are especially inadequate to address the impact of opioid 
22 use disorder on those experiencing or having experienced unstable housing, minimal or 
23 no employment, unreliable transp01iation, lack of insurance coverage, use of multiple 
24 substances, frequent hospitalization or prior overdoses; and 
25 Whereas, failure to provide timely treatment to those most at risk of overdose death 
26 from opioid use leads to unnecessary loss of life and tragic dislocations of family life, 
27 while imposing substantial additional costs on the State due to related increases in 
28 incarcerations, hospital admissions and foster care for children affected by parental use of 
29 opioids; and 
30 Whereas, a low barrier, rapid access treatment system delivered and coordinated by 
31 Maine's community health centers will provide an essential component of an improved 
32 array of responses to this epidemic; and 
33 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
34 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as

31 community health centers selected on the basis of applications demonstrating interest in 
32 implementing the pilot project and capacity to implement the pilot project. The

36 project. 
37 3. Reimbursement. The department shall modify and supplement the 
3 8 reimbursement of community health centers provided under the Maine Revised Statutes,
