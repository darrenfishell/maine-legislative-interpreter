Page 1 - 129LR1934(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA §101, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 431, §35, is 
3further amended to read:
41.  The State is not required to negate any facts expressly designated as a "defense," 
5or any exception, exclusion or authorization that is set out in the statute defining the 
6crime by proof at trial, unless the existence of the defense, exception, exclusion or 
7authorization is in issue as a result of evidence admitted at the trial that is sufficient to 
8raise a reasonable doubt on the issue, in which case the State must disprove its existence 
9beyond a reasonable doubt.  The determination of the applicability of a defense, 
10exception, exclusion or authorization is a preliminary question of fact under the Maine 
11Rules of Evidence, Rule 104 that must be proved by the totality of the circumstances and 
12not by viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the defendant.   This subsection 
13does not require a trial court to instruct on an issue that has been waived by the defendant.  
14The subject of waiver is addressed by the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure.
15Sec. 2.  17-A MRSA §108, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2007, c. 173, §24, is 
16further amended to read:
17B.  The person was the initial aggressor, unless after such aggression the person 
18withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to such other person the 
19intent to do so, but the other person notwithstanding continues the use or threat of 
20unlawful, nondeadly force; or
21Sec. 3.  17-A MRSA §108, sub-§1, ¶C, as enacted by PL 1975, c. 499, §1, is 
22amended to read:
23C.  The force involved was the product of a combat by agreement not authorized by 
24law.; or
25Sec. 4.  17-A MRSA §108, sub-§1, ¶D is enacted to read:
26D.  The person was engaged in criminal conduct against the other person or the other 
27person's property concurrently with the use of the nondeadly force.
28SUMMARY
29This bill amends the Maine Criminal Code by clarifying that determination of the 
30applicability of a defense is a preliminary question of fact under the Maine Rules of 
31Evidence that must be proved by the totality of the circumstances and not by viewing the 
32evidence in a light most favorable to the defendant and by providing that the use of 
33nondeadly force in defense of a person is not justified when the person is engaged in 
34criminal conduct against the other person or the other person's property concurrently with 
35the use of the nondeadly force.
