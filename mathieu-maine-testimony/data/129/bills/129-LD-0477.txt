3SUMMARY
4This bill establishes the Federal Shutdown Loan Guarantee Program.  The program, 
5administered by the Finance Authority of Maine, provides easier access to no-interest 
6loans for certain federal employees in Maine affected by the partial shutdown of the 
7Federal Government, which began December 22, 2018, by guaranteeing up to 10% of the 
8loans eligible credit unions and financial institutions make to affected employees. 
9Under the bill, affected employees are eligible for up to 3 loans, each equal to their 
10monthly after-tax pay, up to $5,000, less unemployment benefits. The bill prohibits 
11interest on the loans during the shutdown and for 270 days after the shutdown ends.  
12Following the end of the 270 days, an eligible financial institution that made a loan under 
13the program, after a good faith effort to collect the principal amount of the loan, may 
14apply to the authority for repayment of the uncollected amount of the loan in default.  The 
15authority is required to make reasonable efforts to recoup the amount of any payments 
16made to eligible financial institutions from the employee who defaulted on the loan.
17The bill gives the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
18authority to report out legislation to address any funding needs of the program.
