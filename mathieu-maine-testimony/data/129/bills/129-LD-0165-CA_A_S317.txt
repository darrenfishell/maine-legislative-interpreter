The bill establishes a restriction on the use of handheld devices and mobile telephones while driving. The penalty for 
violating this restriction is no less than $50 for the first infraction and no less than $250 for subsequent infractions. 
Given the effective date of the bill, possible delays in implementing the infraction and time between when a ticket is 
issued and funds are collected, the judicial branch has estimated that there will be 1, 100 infractions in fiscal year 2019-
20 and 5,500 infractions in fiscal year 2020-21. Part of the revenues collected from this fine will be used to support 
one limited-period Assistant Clerk position to process the anticipated increase in traffic infractions and the bill 
includes allocations of $24,785 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $77,138 in fiscal year 2020-21. The remaining revenues, 
$37,255 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $357,142 in fiscal year 2020-21, will be credited to the Supplemental 
Transportation Fund established in the bill. The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations for the Fund of 
$500 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20. 
In addition to the fines of $50 and $250, there are several surcharges and fees that will be charged and credited into 
other funds across state government, including the County Jail Operations Fund, the County Jail Prisoner Support and 
Community Corrections Fund, the Maine Criminal Justice Academy, the State Police and the Civil Legal Services 
Fund. In total, an estimated $14,960 will be credited across these funds in fiscal year 2019-20 and an additional 
$82,720 in fiscal year 2020-21.
