6A.  "Net amount" means the amount of money due an employee as compensation 
7after any deductions or withholdings other than an employer's withholding for the 
8purpose of recovering any overcompensation.
9B.  "Overcompensation" means any compensation paid to an employee, including 
10paid leave, that is greater than that to which the employee is entitled under the 
11compensation system established by the employer, but does not include fringe 
12benefits, awards, bonuses, settlements or insurance proceeds in respect to or in lieu of 
13compensation, expense reimbursements, commissions or draws or advances against 
14compensation.
15C.  "Paid leave" has the same meaning as in section 636, subsection 1, paragraph C.
162.  Recovery of overcompensation; limits.  An employer who has overcompensated 
17an employee through employer error may not withhold more than 10% 5% of the net 
18amount of any subsequent pay without the employee's written permission, except that, if 
19the employee voluntarily terminates employment, the employer may deduct the full 
20amount of overcompensation from any wages due.  An employer who has 
21overcompensated an employee through employer error may not recover more than the 
22amount of overcompensation paid to that employee in the 3 years preceding the date of 
23discovery of the overcompensation.
243.  Violation.  If an employer with over 25 employees violates this section, that 
25employer forfeits any claim to the overcompensation.
26If an employer with 25 or fewer employees knows of the limitation established by 
27subsection 2 and violates this section, that employer forfeits any claim to the 
28overcompensation.  Employers An employer of 25 or fewer employees who do does not 
29know of the limitation established by subsection 2 and who violate violates this section 
30shall return all money withheld in excess of that permitted under subsection 2 within 3 
31days of written or oral demand by the employee, or forfeit forfeits any claim to the 
32overcompensation. 
334.  Application.  This section is applied as follows.
34A.  An employer has the burden of proof, except that, if the overcompensation 
35amounts to less than 15% of the correct net amount of the employee's compensation, 
36the employer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the employee 
37knowingly accepted the overcompensation.
38B.  If an employee knowingly accepts the overcompensation, this section does not 
39apply.
Page 2 - 129LR1418(01)-11C.  This section, except for the forfeiture provisions in subsection 3, does not limit or 
2affect an employer's general civil remedies against an employee or an employee's 
3general civil remedies against an employer.
4SUMMARY
5This bill amends the definition of "overcompensation" by an employer to include 
6compensation in the form of paid leave. It changes the maximum amount an employer 
7can withhold from an employee's pay to recover overcompensation from 10% to 5%. It 
8prohibits an employer from recovering more than the amount of overcompensation paid 
9to an employee in the 3 years preceding the discovery of the overcompensation. The bill 
10also specifies that the section of law regarding overcompensation by employers that 
11includes these provisions does not limit or affect an employee's general civil remedies 
12against an employer.
