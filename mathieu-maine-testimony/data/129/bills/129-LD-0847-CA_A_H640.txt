129TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 621, L.D. 847, Bill, "An Act To 
Ensure Persons with Disabilities Have Access to Public Rest Rooms" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and inserting the 
following: 
'Sec. 1. 5 MRSA ยง4594-G, sub-ยง12 is enacted to read: 
12. Single-occupancy toilet facilities; qualifying new construction. Beginning 
January 1, 2020, new construction of a public building, as defined in subsection 6, must 
include single-occupancy toilet facilities that meet the standards of construction required 
by this section. This subsection applies to new construction for which the maximum 
occupant capacity exceeds 100 individuals.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and instead provides that after January 1, 2020, new 
construction of public buildings must include single-occupancy toilet facilities that meet 
the accessibility requirements established in the Maine Human Rights Act, if the new 
construction has a maximum occupant capacity exceeding 100 individuals. For example, 
after January 1, 2020, a restaurant that seats at least 101 individuals is subject to the 
single-occupancy toilet facilities requirement.
