Page 1 - 129LR0781(01)-11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  23 MRSA ยง1973, sub-ยง3, as amended by PL 2017, c. 68, ยง5, is further 
3amended to read:
43.  Tolls.  Tolls, or the fixing of tolls, is not rulemaking and is not subject to 
5supervision or regulation by any state commission, board or agency.  Subject to 
6subsection 4, the authority may fix and revise from time to time tolls for the use of the 
7turnpike and the different parts or sections of the turnpike, including, but not limited to, a 
8connector, and charge and collect the tolls, and contract with any person, partnership, 
9association or corporation desiring the use of any part of the turnpike, including the 
10right-of-way adjoining the paved portion.  The tolls must be so fixed and adjusted as to 
11provide a fund at least sufficient with other revenues of the turnpike, if any, to pay for 
12each fiscal year:
13A.  The cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the turnpike, and providing and 
14maintaining reasonable reserves for those costs;
15B.  The bonds and the interest on those bonds, and all sinking fund requirements, and 
16other requirements provided by the resolution authorizing issuance of the bonds or by 
17the trust indenture or loan or a security agreement as those bonds, interest, sinking 
18fund requirements and other requirements become due;
19C.  Those sums for the purpose of maintaining, constructing or reconstructing access 
20roads or portions of access roads that have been requested by the department and in 
21the sole discretion of the authority are from time to time determined to warrant the 
22expenditure of turnpike revenues; and
23D.  The cost of maintaining, constructing or reconstructing interchanges.
24The authority may use any method for assessing and collecting tolls, including but not 
25limited to toll tickets, barrier toll facilities, billing accounts, commuter passes and 
26electronic recording or identification devices.  The display of a recording or identification 
27device issued or authorized by the authority for these purposes on or near the windshield 
28of a motor vehicle is not a violation of a law or rule, including but not limited to Title 
2929-A, sections 1916 and 2082, unless the device is attached in a way that obstructs the 
30driver's clear view of the highway or an intersecting highway.  To the extent the authority 
31uses an electronic recording or identification device to assess or collect tolls, the authority 
32shall allow payment by telephone of any amount related to tolls assessed by the use of 
33that device.
34SUMMARY
35This bill directs the Maine Turnpike Authority to allow payment in any amount of 
36electronically assessed or recorded tolls to be made by telephone.
