Legislative Savings/Study 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment would reduce the number of Legislators serving on the task force from 4 to 2 and therefore reduce 
the cost of the study to the Legislature by $500 in each of fiscal years 2017-18 and 2018-19. The Legislature's 
proposed budget includes approximately $7,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $10,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 
legislative studies. Whether these amounts are sufficient to fund all studies will depend on the number of studies 
authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature.
