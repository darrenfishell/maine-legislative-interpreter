C. The reimbursement that the initiator of the deposit is obligated to pay the dealer or 
redemption center pursuant to paragraph A or B must be reduced by 1/2¢ for any 
returned container that is subject to a qualified commingling agreement that allows 
the dealer or redemption center to commingle beverage containers of like product 
group, material and size. A commingling agreement is qualified for purposes of this 
paragraph if the department determines that 50% or more of the beverage containers 
of like product group, material and size for which the deposits are being initiated in 
the State are covered by the commingling agreement or that the initiators of deposit 
covered by the commingling agreement are initiators of deposit for wine containers 
who each sell no more than 100,000 gallons of wine or 500,000 beverage containers 
that contain wine in a calendar year. Once the initiator of deposit has established a 
qualified commingling agreement for containers of a like product group, material and 
size, the department shall allow additional brands to be included from a different 
product group if they are of like material. The State, through the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
Operations, shall make every reasonable effort to enter into a qualified commingling 
agreement under this paragraph with every other initiator of deposit for beverage 
containers that are of like product group, size and material as the beverage containers 
for which the State is the initiator of deposit. 
D. Paragraphs A, Band C do not apply to a brewer who annually produces no more 
than 50,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more 
than 250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product. In 
addition to the payment of the refund value, an initiator of deposit under section 
3103, subsections 1 to 4 who is also a brewer who annually produces no more than 
50,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more than 
250,000 containers each containing no more than one gallon of its product shall 
reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for the cost of handling beverage 
containers subject to section 3103 in an amount that equals at least 3¢ per returned 
container for containers picked up before March 1, 2019 and at least 3 1/2¢ for 
containers picked up on or after March 1, 2019.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would create a uniform refund value of 5 ¢ for all returnable beverage containers starting March 1, 2019. 
Because the bottle redemption program is included in the spirits administration contract with Pine State Trading 
Company, this change would require an addendum to the cunent contract. As a result of the new redemption value, the 
spirits contract vendor would be required to phase in new redemption stickers and to affix new redemption stickers to 
any remaining inventory in stock that was purchased prior to, and that remained unsold on, March 1, 2019. 
Additionally, because the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lotte1y Operations acts as the initiator of deposits on 
Spirits purchased under the spirits contract, the bureau will be required to reimburse agency liquor stores for the cost 
difference between the deposits on spirits purchased before March 1, 2019 and the refund value on those same 
purchases still unsold or returned after that date. The bill includes a one-time allocation of $60,000 in fiscal year 2018-
19 to reimburse agency liquor stores. This bill also increases the rate of handling cost reimbursement paid by the 
initiator of deposit to a dealer or local redemption center from 4¢ a container to 4.5¢ a container. The bill includes an 
ongoing allocation of $147,000 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 for this purpose. It is anticipated that the Alcoholic, 
Beverages Fund will have sufficient revenue to fund these allocations in the near future. However, the additional 
expenditures from the fund may eventually put required payments to the Maine Municipal Bond Bank at risk. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection as a result of changes to the redemption value are 
anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
