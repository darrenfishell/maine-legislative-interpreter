SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Education

proficiency-based diplomas and to delay by one year the timeline for the implementation 
of proficiency-based diplomas. The amendment makes several changes to the 
implementation of the proficiency-based system, including: 
1. Refining the provisions regarding the exceptions for ntudents with disabilities to 
be awarded a proficiency-based diploma; and 
2. Strengthening the provisions for career and technical education students to meet 
the proficiency-based diploma requirements within the context of the career and technical 
education curriculum, including career and technical education programs and courses as 
defined in the Department of Education's rules. 
The amendment also requires that the Department of Education provide technical 
assistance to school administrative units in implementing proficiency-based systems, 
including providing definitions of proficiency, establishing criteria for ensuring that the 
intents and purposes of a proficiency-based system are achieved, developing model 
course descriptions and developing training resources for use in training educators.

Potential State Mandate -Unfunded 
State Mandates 
Required Activity Unit Affected 
Requires each school administrative unit (SAU) to convene a stakeholder group to: School 
1) determine status of implementing a proficiency-based system; 2) provide an 
assessment of work needed to be done in order to meet established deadlines; and 3) 
develop and provide appropriate training for all educators in proficiency-based 
system. Also requires each SAU to form a steering committee to regularly review 
and refine the SAU's proficiency-based system to ensure that it meets requirements 
and is aligned with SAU's goals and priorities. Local Cost 
Significant 
statewide 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occms, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to provide the required technical assistance to SAU's in 
implementing proficiency-based systems can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
