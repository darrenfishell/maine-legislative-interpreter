30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. It is the unanimous report 
32 of the committee. The amendment: 
33 1. Allows a facility that tests medical marijuana samples for the cannabinoid profile, 
34 potency and contaminants to operate in the absence of rules adopted by the Department of 
35 Health and Human Services if the facility has obtained documentation of the facility's 
36 accreditation pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for 
3 7 Standardization by a 3rd-party accrediting body; 
38 2. Clarifies that qualifying patients, primary caregivers and registered dispensaries 
39 may manufacture marijuana products from harvested marijuana, including production of

1 marijuana concentrate by processes of marijuana extraction that do not involve certain 
2 inherently hazardous substances; 
3 3. Establishes a process for persons or entities that are not qualifying patients, 
4 primary caregivers or registered dispensaries to manufacture marijuana products from 
5 harvested marijuana, including marijuana concentrate by processes of marijuana 
6 extraction that do not involve certain inherently hazardous substances, to become 
7 registered to manufacture marijuana products; 
8 4. Establishes a method for qualifying patients, primary caregivers and registered 
9 dispensaries to become authorized by law to produce marijuana concentrate by processes 
10 involving inherently hazardous substances if certain safety and compliance standards are 
11 met; 
12 5. Establishes a process for persons or entities that are not qualifying patients, 
13 registered caregivers or registered dispensaries to become authorized to produce 
14 marijuana concentrate by processes involving inherently hazardous substances; and 
15 6. Repeals specific provisions of law regarding municipal authority to establish a 
16 moratorium on registered primary caregivers near schools and municipal authority to 
17 regulate dispensaries. The amendment instead enacts a new provision of law that allows 
18 municipalities to regulate registered primary caregivers, registered dispensaries, 
19 marijuana testing facilities and marijuana manufacturing facilities, except that 
20 municipalities are not allowed to prohibit or limit the number of registered primary 
21 caregivers.

Potential cunent biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds

Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Increases the number of civil suits. 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new cases filed in the court system does not require 
additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional filing fees may increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Allowing facilities that test medical marijuana samples to operate in the absence of rules, clarifying that qualified and 
non qualified persons may manufachu-e marijuana concentrate by a process of extraction not involving inherently 
hazardous substances and establishing a process for persons to become authorized to produce marijuana concentrate 
by a process involving inherently hazardous substances may increase marijuana products sales. No estimate of the 
potential increase in General Fund and Local Government Fund revenues as a result of increased sales tax collections 
is made at this time. 
Additionally, there is a potential increase in registration fees to the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) for facilities that register to produce marijuana concentrate by a process involving inherently hazardous 
substances. Cunently manufachiring facilities are not required to register or notify the DHHS of their operations, so 
no estimates of the increase in registration fees or the increased costs to the DHHS for registration and auditing 
program compliance are made at this time. 
The bill also creates new registration tiers for manufachu-ing facilities, which could also increase the overall 
registration fees to DHHS. As the decision to change the tier ofregistration lies with each provider, no estimate of the 
increase in registration fees are made at this time.
