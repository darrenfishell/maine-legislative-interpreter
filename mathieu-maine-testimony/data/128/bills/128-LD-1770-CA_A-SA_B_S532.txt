This amendment removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause. It also removes the requirement that a 
voice mail option be included as part of the alternative filing methods to an Internet-based system for the filing of 
unemployment claims. As a result, this amendment eliminates the one-time $895,156 cost of this provision that was 
to be paid from an unspent portion of the 2009 Reed Act funds, including funding for 11 limited period Customer 
Representative Specialist -Benefits positions and the cost of the Interactive Voice Response System. 
This amendment also eliminates the transfer for $82,855 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Labor, Office of 
the Commissioner's Special Revenue Funds account to cover its share of the department's associated indirect costs in 
accordance with the federally approved indirect cost plan. 
As amended, this legislation still requires the department to immediately fill certain vacant positions for which 
funding is available, including Customer Representative Associate, Customer Representative Specialists, Claims 
Adjudicator, Hearings Examiner, Labor Program Specialist and Field Advisor and Examiner.
