22 SUMMARY
23 This bill amends the description of a salaried employee for the laws governing  limits 
24 on mandatory overtime and the definition of "employee" in the laws governing minimum 
25 wages to conform  with the federal guidelines established by the United States Department 
26 of Labor  under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. It sets the minimum salary  at the 
27 threshold established  by the United States Department  of Labor  under  that Act. It 
28 eliminates the requirement that the  salary threshold be tied to the  state minimum wage.
