SUMMARY  5 
This bill allows a municipality to designate in its municipal shellfish conservation 6 
ordinance conservation areas that surround protective netting, fencing, traps or other gear 7 
placed by the municipality in the intertidal  zone where harvesting any marine organism is 8 
prohibited.  The designated conservation area must be clearly marked with signs that 9 
identify the municipality that designated the area and indicate the purpose of the 10 
designated area.  Current law imposes cert ain fines upon municipal shellfish license 11 
holders who harvest shellfish from an area closed for conservation purposes.  This bill 12 
amends that provision to impose certain fines on municipal shellfish license holders and 13 
nonlicense holders who harvest any m arine organism from an area closed pursuant to a 14 
municipal shellfish conservation ordinance.  15
