 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to enact provisions amending the State's mining laws, including, 5 
but not limited to, the followi ng: 6 
1.  It would amend the laws regarding mining on state lands under the Maine Revised 7 
Statutes, Title 12, chapter 201 -A, subchapter 3 to prohibit the issuance of a mining lease 8 
under that chapter authorizing mining operations located wholly or partially in, on or 9 
under designated lands, state historic sites, state parks, public reserved lands, the Allagash 10 
Wilderness Waterway or state -owned wildlife management areas;  11 
2.  It would amend the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act, referred to in this 12 
summary as "the mining act," to prohibit the issuance of a mining permit if any part of a 13 
proposed mining operation will be located wholly or partially in, on or under designated 14 
lands, state historic sites, state parks, public reserved lands, the Allagash Wilderness  15 
Waterway or state -owned wildlife management areas;  16 
3.  It would amend the definition of "mining area" under the mining act to clarify that 17 
each mining operation or activity must have a defined mining area and it would limit the 18 
allowance for groundwater c ontamination within a mining area under the mining act;  19 
4.  It would amend the mining act to prohibit the placement of any mining operation 20 
in, on or under a flood plain or a flood hazard area;  21 
5.  It would amend the mining act to prohibit the placement of  any mining operation 22 
in or on a river, stream or brook or in, on or under a great pond or the coastal waters of 23 
the State;  24 
6.  It would clarify, for the purposes of the mining act, that mining by in situ leaching 25 
is prohibited; and  26 
7.  It would require an  applicant for a permit or a permittee under the mining act to 27 
provide special financial assurance coverage for a worst -case mining event or failure, 28 
with the amount of the coverage to be determined by the Department of Environmental 29 
Protection as based on  an independent 3rd -party cost estimate paid for by the applicant.  30 
Prior to commencing any mining operation or activity under an approved permit, a 31 
permittee would be required to fully fund, with cash or cash equivalents, a trust fund in 32 
the amount of thi s special financial assurance coverage.  33 
The bill also proposes to enact a prohibition on metallic mineral mining in the State 34 
and to direct a corresponding repeal of all state agency rules relating to metallic mineral 35 
mining contingent upon the failure of the Department of Environmental Protection to 36 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1377(01) -1

mining act on or before August 1, 2018.  2
