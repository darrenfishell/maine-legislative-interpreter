§703 -A.  Promotional allowances  12 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 13 
following terms have the following meanings.  14 
A.  "Promotional allowance" means any reba te, discount, credit, reduction in rates or 15 
other promotion offered or provided by a public utility to customers or potential 16 
customers for the purpose of encouraging customers or potential customers to select 17 
or use the service or increase usage of the se rvice of that utility, to select, purchase, 18 
install or use any appliance or equipment designed to use that utility's service or to 19 
use any other particular service of that utility.  20 
2.  Promotional allowance allowed.  Notwithstanding section 703, a public u tility, 21 
without prior notice to or approval from the commission, may offer or provide a 22 
promotional allowance.  23 
3.  Filing of schedules of rates.  Schedules of rates that provide for promotional 24 
allowances take effect when filed with the commission, unless a later effective date is 25 
specified.  26 
4.  Rate -making treatment.  This section does not limit the commission's authority 27 
in any rate case or alternative rate -making proceeding to disallow, in whole or in part, any 28 
expense of a public utility that the commis sion finds to be unjust, unreasonable, excessive 29 
or unwarranted.  A public utility may not recover from any person other than its 30 
shareholders or other owners any expenditures, contributions, expenses or costs incurred 31 
by that utility with respect to promo tional allowances.  32 
5.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 33
