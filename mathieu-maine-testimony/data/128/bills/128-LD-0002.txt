 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  14 MRSA ยง8701, sub -ยง7, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 543, ยง1, is repealed.  2 
SUMMARY  3 
Current law prohibits a person from making a bad faith assertion of patent 4 
infringement against another pe rson.  A person who does make a bad faith assertion may 5 
have to pay remedies awarded by the court, including equitable relief, damages, costs and 6 
fees and punitive damages; however, the law exempts persons seeking relief pursuant to 7 
35 United States Code, Section 271(e)(2) or 42 United States Code, Section 262 from the 8 
law prohibiting bad faith assertions of patent infringement, which may include businesses 9 
such as pharmaceutical companies.  This bill removes the exemption.  10
