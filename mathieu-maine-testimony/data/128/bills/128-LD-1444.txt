adopted under this sub section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 22 
375, subchapter 2 -A.  The commission shall ensure that the rules and procedures 23 
established under this chapter provide opportunities for entities other than the standard 24 
buyer to aggregate and sell the output of distributed generation resources in the applicable 25 
markets.  26 
§3476.  Large -scale community solar procurement  27 
1.  Procurement goal.  The commission shall procure 120 megawatts of large -scale 28 
community solar distributed generation resou rces by January 1, 2022.  In order to 29 
accomplish this goal, the commission shall conduct annual competitive solicitations, each 30 
for 30 megawatts of large -scale community solar distributed generation resources.  31 
2.  Initial procurement.  On or before March 1 , 2018, the commission shall conduct 32 
a competitive solicitation for an initial procurement of long -term contracts for the output 33 
of at least 30 megawatts of large -scale community solar distributed generation resources 34 
as part of the procurement goal in sub section 1.  Bids must be accepted for 120 calendar 35 
days and reviewed based on the requirements set forth in subsections 7, 8 and 9.  The 36 
highest awarded bid rate must be established as the standard solar rate for all awarded 37 
bids in the initial procurement .  If there is more than one bid at that rate, preference will 38 
be given to the project that was submitted first, as determined by the time stamp showing 39 
when the bid was received by the commission.  The commission shall select and notify 40 
successful bidders  no later than 30 calendar days after the bid acceptance period has 41 
ended.  42 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR1425(01) -1 
 3.  Declining block contract rate.  For each subsequent procurement for long -term 1 
contracts for the output of 30 megawatts of large -scale community solar distributed 2 
generation reso urces after the initial procurement in subsection 2, the commission shall 3 
establish a declining block contract rate by reducing the rate awarded in the previous 4 
procurement by no more than 3%.  5 
4.  Subsequent procurements.  To ensure competition for procure ments after the 6 
initial procurement under subsection 2 for the output of 30 megawatts of large -scale 7 
community solar distributed generation resources, the following standards apply:  8 
A.  Each procurement after the initial procurement must be open for 120 ca lendar 9 
days;  10 
B.  In addition to a bidder's standard bid rate, a bidder must also provide a discounted 11 
bid rate;  12 
C.  After the 120 calendar -day bid acceptance period ends, the commission shall 13 
review bids in accordance with subsections 7, 8 and 9;  14 
D.  If the total bids received in the aggregate is for less than 30 megawatts, contracts 15 
must be awarded to all bidders at the applicable declining block contract rate;  16 
E.  If the total bids received in the aggregate is for more than 30 megawatts, 17 
preference will b e given to those bidders with the lowest discounted bid rate and 18 
contracts must be awarded to all selected bidders at the lowest qualified discounted 19 
bid rate;  20 
F.  If there are multiple bids at the same discounted bid rate, preference will be given 21 
to the project that was submitted first, as determined by the time stamp showing when 22 
the bid was received by the commission; and  23 
G.  The commission shall select and notify successful bidders no later than 30 24 
calendar days after the bid acceptance period has ende d. 25 
5.  Qualification for capacity allocation.  The commission shall set standards for 26 
qualifications under the declining block contract rate.  All qualified projects must 27 
complete construction within 2 years of being awarded a contract.  The commission may  28 
by rule charge a capacity reservation fee to defray administrative costs.  29 
6.  Standard contract.  Prior to a solicitation, the commission shall develop, in 30 
consultation with the standard buyer, a standard contract that commits all parties to 31 
commercially reasonable behavior and includes provisions to ensure that projects proceed 32 
to commercial operation on a reasonable timeline.  33 
7.  Bidder eligibility.  The commission shall establish minimum requirements for 34 
bidders in a solicitation under this section, inc luding, but not limited to, site control, 35 
development experience, completion of an interconnection application and provision of 36 
system details.  Bidders must demonstrate development experience through relevant 37 
experience and expertise in successfully devel oping, financing, constructing, operating 38 
and maintaining a large -scale solar project and fulfilling its obligation to participating 39 
subscribers.  The commission may by rule require bidders to pay a bidding fee to defray 40 
administrative costs.  41 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR1425(01) -1 
 8.  Ensuring competition.  The commission shall establish standards to ensure that 1 
each solicitation under this section has a sufficient number of unique bidders and quantity 2 
of offered capacity to be competitive.  If the commission concludes based on these 3 
standards t hat a solicitation is not competitive, no bidders may be selected and the 4 
capacity available in that solicitation must be deferred to a subsequent solicitation.  The 5 
commission may by rule adjust the maximum project size eligible for a solicitation to 6 
ensure that there is more than one bid selected.  7 
9.  Bid selection.  Following review of bids in a solicitation under this section, if the 8 
commission determines that the solicitation is competitive pursuant to subsection 8, the 9 
commission shall select one or m ore winning bidders and direct the standard buyer to 10 
negotiate and enter into a contract with the winning bidder or bidders for a term of 20 11 
years at a specified contract rate.  The commission shall select bids that maximize 12 
benefits or minimize costs to a ll ratepayers.  13 
10.  Payment and minimum subscription.  The project sponsor and subscribers 14 
must receive the contract rate for the output of a large -scale community solar distributed 15 
generation resource that is fully subscribed.  For any portion not subscri bed, the project 16 
sponsor receives the wholesale rate.  17 
At least 50% of the subscriptions to a large -scale community solar distributed generation 18 
resource must be for 25 kilowatts or less, unless a municipality accounts for more than 19 
50% of the subscriptions  to a large -scale community solar distributed generation 20 
resource.  A municipality may not account for more than 70% of the subscriptions to a 21 
large -scale community solar distributed generation resource.  22 
11.  Determination of subscriber bill credit.  The b ill credit to be allocated to each 23 
subscriber to a particular large -scale community solar distributed generation resource 24 
must be based on each subscriber's percentage interest of the total production of the 25 
large -scale community solar distributed generati on resource for the previous month.  26 
Each billing month, the value of the credits allocated to each subscriber must be 27 
calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt -hours equal to each subscriber's share 28 
by the credit rate.  On a monthly basis, the proj ect sponsor shall provide to the 29 
transmission and distribution utility in a standardized and electronic format the 30 
information required to calculate the bill credit to be provided to each subscriber.  Credits 31 
to a subscriber must be applied against the sub scriber's monthly electricity bill in 32 
accordance with section 3477.  The transmission and distribution utility shall provide a 33 
record to the project sponsor of the credits applied to the transmission and distribution 34 
utility's associated subscribers each m onth after those credits are applied to the 35 
subscriber's bill.  36 
The monthly output available for allocation as subscribed or unsubscribed energy must be 37 
determined by a revenue -grade meter installed and paid for by the project sponsor.  38 
12.  Exemption.  A project sponsor or subscriber is not considered a public utility or 39 
competitive electricity supplier solely as a result of the project sponsor's or subscriber's 40 
interest or participation in a large -scale community solar distributed generation resource.  41 
13.  Renewable energy credits.  The commission shall develop a standard disclosure 42 
to be provided by the project sponsor to all participating subscribers prior to their entering 43 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR1425(01) -1 
 into a contract under this section that describes the effect of selling the renewab le 1 
attributes of exported electricity to the standard buyer and explains how a subscriber may 2 
participate in the voluntary renewable energy credit market.  3 
14.  Consumer protection.  The commission shall establish by rule consumer 4 
protection standards to pr otect subscribers from fraud and other unfair and deceptive 5 
business practices.  The commission may impose administrative penalties upon a project 6 
sponsor in accordance with chapter 15 and may order restitution for any party injured by 7 
a violation for whic h a penalty may be assessed pursuant to chapter 15.  8 
The commission through its own counsel or through the Attorney General may apply to 9 
the Superior Court of any county of the State to enforce any lawful order made or action 10 
taken by the commission pursuan t to this subsection.  The court may issue such orders, 11 
preliminary or final, as it considers proper under the facts established before it.  12 
15.  Disclosures.  A project sponsor selling or reselling a subscription in a large -scale 13 
community solar distribute d generation resource or proposed large -scale community solar 14 
distributed generation resource shall provide a disclosure to potential subscribers that 15 
includes the following prior to the sale or resale of that subscription:  16 
A.  A good faith estimate of the  annual kilowatt -hours to be delivered by the large - 17 
scale community solar distributed generation resource based on the size of the 18 
subscriber's interest;  19 
B.  A plain language explanation of the terms under which the bill credits under 20 
section 3477 will be calculated;  21 
C.  A plain language explanation of the contract provisions regulating the disposition 22 
or transfer of the subscription; and  23 
D.  A plain language explanation of the costs and benefits to the potential subscriber, 24 
based on the subscriber's curren t usage and applicable tariff, for the term of the 25 
proposed contract.  26 
The commission may establish a standard disclosure to be provided to potential 27 
subscribers by a project sponsor to disclose this information or such other information as 28 
the commission m ay determine necessary to protect the interests of potential subscribers.  29 
16.  Transfer of subscriptions.  A subscriber may transfer or assign a subscription to 30 
the associated project sponsor or to any person or entity who qualifies to be a subscriber 31 
in the large -scale community solar distributed generation resource.  A project sponsor 32 
must provide a process for assignment or transfer of a subscription.  A project sponsor 33 
may not impose transfer fees on a subscriber who moves to a different location within  the 34 
same utility service territory.  35 
17.  Project sponsor report.  One year after commercial operation of a large -scale 36 
community solar distributed generation resource commences, the project sponsor must 37 
submit to the commission a report detailing what per centage of subscribers earn less than 38 
the State's median income.  39 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR1425(01) -1 
 18.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 1 
adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 2 
375, subchapter 2 -A. 3 
§3477.  Bill credits  4 
This section applies to any credits assigned to a customer's bill under this chapter.  5 
If the value of the credit to be applied to a customer's bill is less than the amount 6 
owed by the customer at the end of the applicable billing period , the customer must be 7 
billed for the difference between the amount shown on the bill and the value of the 8 
available credits.  9 
If the value of the credits to be applied to a customer's bill is greater than the amount 10 
owed by the customer at the end of the b illing period, the remaining value of the credit 11 
must carry over from month to month until a specified date each year.  The commission 12 
shall establish a minimum of 2 standard credit expiration dates that provide customers the 13 
opportunity to use bill credit s to the maximum extent practicable in a given 12 -month 14 
period.  Any remaining credits as of that date must be credited to the standard buyer and 15 
may not be applied against any future customer bill.  16 
The commission shall adopt rules to implement this sectio n.  Rules adopted under 17 
this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 18 
Sec. 4.  Rules.  The Public Utilities Commission shall adopt rules to implement the 19 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, sections 3475 to 34 77 by January 1, 2018.  20 
SUMMARY  21 
This bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to enter into long -term contracts 22 
with a duration of 20 years for the procurement of 120 megawatts of large -scale 23 
community solar distributed generation resources by 2022.  24 
The bill designates a standard buyer, which the bill specifies is the investor -owned 25 
transmission and distribution utility in its service territory.  The bill allows the 26 
commission to designate another entity as the standard buyer if the commission 27 
determines  it is in the best interest of ratepayers to do so.  The purpose of the standard 28 
buyer is to purchase the output of large -scale community solar distributed generation 29 
resources, aggregate the portfolio of distributed generation resources procured and sell or 30 
use the output of these resources in a manner that maximizes the value of this portfolio of 31 
resources to all ratepayers.  32 
The bill directs the commission to conduct an initial competitive solicitation for 30 33 
megawatts of output of large -scale community s olar distributed generation by March 1, 34 
2018.  The bill directs the commission and standard buyer to develop a contract prior to a 35 
solicitation that will ensure that projects proceed to commercial operation on a reasonable 36 
timeline and commits all parties to commercially reasonable behavior.  37 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR1425(01) -1 
 The bill gives the commission authority to establish requirements for bidder 1 
eligibility and standards to ensure competition in the bidding process.  The bill also 2 
specifies that if the solicitation is determined compet itive the commission must select one 3 
or more winning bids and direct the standard buyer to negotiate and enter into a contract 4 
with the winning bidder or bidders.  If the commission concludes the solicitation is not 5 
competitive, no bidders may be selected and the capacity available in that solicitation 6 
must be deferred to a subsequent solicitation.  The bill requires the commission to select 7 
bids that maximize the benefits or minimize the costs to all ratepayers.  8 
The bill requires after the first solicitati on that the highest bid rate awarded a contract 9 
is the standard solar rate.  For each subsequent procurement for 30 megawatts of 10 
large -scale community solar distributed generation resources, the commission must 11 
establish a declining block rate by reducing the rate awarded in the previous procurement 12 
by up to 3%.  Bidders in subsequent procurement must submit both a standard bid rate 13 
and a discounted bid rate.  The bill specifies that if the total bids received in the aggregate 14 
is for less than 30 megawatts in subsequent solicitations, contracts will be awarded to all 15 
bidders at the applicable declining block rate; however, if the total bids received in the 16 
aggregate is for more than 30 megawatts, preference will be given to those bidders with 17 
the lowest disc ounted bid rate and contracts must be awarded to all selected bidders at the 18 
lowest qualified discounted bid rate.  The bill requires that if there are multiple bids at the 19 
same discounted bid rate, preference will be given to the project that was submitte d first, 20 
as determined by the time stamp showing when the bid was received by the commission.  21 
The bill specifies that the bill credit allocated to a subscriber to a particular large - 22 
scale community solar distributed generation resource must be based on eac h subscriber's 23 
percentage interest of the total production of the large -scale community solar distributed 24 
generation resource for the previous month.  The bill requires the project sponsor to 25 
provide to the transmission and distribution utility, on a month ly basis, the information 26 
required to calculate the bill credit to be provided to each subscriber.  The bill includes 27 
provisions on how payments to a subscriber must be credited against the subscriber's 28 
monthly electricity bill.  29 
The bill requires the Publi c Utilities Commission to adopt routine technical rules 30 
regarding the procurement of large -scale community solar distributed generation 31 
resources by January 1, 2018.  32
