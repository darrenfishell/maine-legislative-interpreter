or because of previous actions taken by the applicant that are protected under Title 8 
26, chapter 7, subchapter 5 -B; or, because of those reasons, to discharge an employee 9 
or discriminate with respect to hire, tenure, promotion, transfer, compensation, terms, 10

Title 39 -A or b ecause of previous actions that are protected under Title 26, chapter 7, 17 
subchapter 5 -B; 18 
(1)  This paragraph does not apply to discrimination governed by Title 39 -A, 19 
section 353; and 20 
(2) Evidence of discrimination with respect to compensation includes, but  is not 21 
limited to:  22 
(a)  An employer, either directly or indirectly through an employment agency 23 
working on behalf of the employer, inquiring about or seeking the wage 24 
history of a prospective employee from the prospective employee or a current 25 
or former e mployer or requiring that a prospective employee's prior wage 26 
history meet certain criteria unless an offer of employment that includes all 27 
terms of compensation has been negotiated and made to the prospective 28 
employee, after which the employer or employme nt agency may inquire 29 
about or confirm the prospective employee's wage history.  If a prospective 30 
employee has voluntarily disclosed wage history information, the employer 31 
or employment agency may seek to confirm or permit a prospective 32 
employee to confirm  such information prior to an offer of employment; or  33 
(b)  An employer prohibiting an employee from disclosing the employee's 34 
own wages or from inquiring about or disclosing another employee's wages;  35 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §628, first ¶, as amended by PL 2009, c . 29, §1, is further 36 
amended to read:  37 
An employer may not discriminate between employees in the same establishment on 38 
the basis of sex by paying wages to any employee in any occupation in this State at a rate 39 
less than the rate at which the employer pays a ny employee of the opposite sex for 40 
comparable work on jobs that have comparable requirements relating to skill, effort and 41 
responsibility. Differentials that are paid pursuant to established seniority systems or 42 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0104(01) -1 
 merit increase systems or difference in the  shift or time of the day worked that do not 1 
discriminate on the basis of sex are not within this prohibition. An employer may not 2 
discharge or discriminate against any employee by reason of any action taken by such 3 
employee to invoke or assist in any mann er the enforcement of this section.  An employer 4 
may not prohibit an employee from disclosing the employee's own wages or from 5 
inquiring about or disclosing  another employee's wages if the purpose of the disclosure or 6 
inquiry is to enforce the rights grant ed by this section .  Nothing in this section creates an 7 
obligation to disclose wages.  8 
SUMMARY  9 
This bill amends the Maine Human Rights Act to provide that evidence of 10 
discrimination with respect to compensation includes an employer seeking information 11 
about  a prospective employee's prior wage history before an offer of employment, 12 
including all compensation, to the prospective employee has been made.  It provides that 13 
this discrimination is also evidenced by an employer requiring that a prospective 14 
employee' s prior compensation history meet certain criteria.  The bill broadens a 15 
provision in the current equal pay law to prohibit an employer from preventing 16 
employees from discussing or disclosing other employees' wages and makes the practice 17 
a violation of the  Maine Human Rights Act as well.  18
