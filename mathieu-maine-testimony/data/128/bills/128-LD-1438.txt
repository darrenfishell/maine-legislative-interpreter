SUMMARY  18 
This bill amends the aquaculture leasing and licensing laws.  It removes the 19 
prohibition on the provision by the Department of Marine Resources of promotional and 20 
marketing assistance to the aquaculture  industry.  It extends the potential term of an 21 
aquaculture lease from 10 to 20 years.  It changes the order of preference for lease 22 
applications to include in the 2nd position an individual who currently holds a limited - 23 
purpose aquaculture license for the  area.  It provides a process by which a holder of a 24 
standard lease could seek an expansion of the lease area by up to 10% once during the 25 
duration of the lease without having to apply for a new lease.  It places the licensed 26 
activities and criteria for li mited -purpose aquaculture licenses in separate statutory 27 
provisions.  It requires a limited -purpose aquaculture license holder to specify if the 28 
license is for commercial or personal use and to identify the growing area and current 29 
classification of the ar ea.  It adds consideration of any risk to public health to the criteria 30 
used in determining whether to grant a limited -purpose aquaculture license.  It adds to the 31 
eligibility criteria for a limited -purpose aquaculture license the completion of any 32 
educati onal courses that may be required by the Commissioner of Marine Resources.  33
