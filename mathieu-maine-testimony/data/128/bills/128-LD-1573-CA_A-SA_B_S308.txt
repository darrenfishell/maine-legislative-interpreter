7 FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
8 SENATE AMENDMENT "J5" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 551, 
9 L.D. 1573, Bill, "An Act To Encourage Development in the Logging Industry by 
10 Requiring State and Local Government Agencies To Give Preference to Lumber and 
11 Solid Wood Products Harvested in the State" 
12 Amend the amendment in the 9th paragraph after the substitute title in the first 5 lines 
13 (page 1, lines 33 and 34 and page 2, lines 1 to 3 in amendment) by striking out the first 
14 sentence and inserting the following: 'Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 
15 contrary, and to the extent consistent with federal law, if the State provides a subsidy to a 
16 landowner who sells timber harvested from the landowner's land in this State, the 
17 landowner shall use an in-state contractor to harvest and transport that timber, as long as 
18 the price and quality of the work performed by that in-state contractor is equal to that of a 
19 contractor from outside the State. A landowner subject to the provisions of this 
20 subsection as the result of a subsidy provided under the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law 
21 may withdraw that landowner's land from taxation under the Maine Tree Growth Tax 
22 Law without penalty, notwithstanding Title 36, section 581, subsection 3.' 
23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment removes the requirement that a person who receives a subsidy from 
25 the State and who purchases timber give preference to timber harvested by an in-state 
26 contractor. Instead this amendment requires a landowner who receives a subsidy from 
27 the State and who sells timber harvested from the landowner's land in this State to use an 
28 in-state contractor for the harvesting and transportation of that timber, as long as the price 
29 and quality of the work performed by that in-state contractor is equal to the price and 
30 quality of work performed by a contractor from outside the State. It also provides that a 
31 landowner subject to the requirement to use an in-state contractor to harvest and transport
