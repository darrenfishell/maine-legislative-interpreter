Sec. 2.  Legislative findings.  The Legislature finds that it is in the best interest of 33 
the people of the State of Maine to encourage the location and expansion of major 34 
business headquarters i n the State and to encourage the recruitment and training of 35 
employees for these facilities.  The Legislature further finds that the location and 36 
expansion of major business headquarters in Maine will create jobs, benefit small 37 
businesses that supply goods  and services to the major business headquarters and its 38 
employees, increase the tax base, and provide many other direct and indirect economic 39 
benefits to the State.  40 
The Legislature further finds that providing benefits only to those major businesses 41 
locat ed in the State is an appropriate way to encourage major businesses to locate in this 42 
State and to encourage major businesses in this State to expand.  The Legislature further 43 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR2369(01) -1 
 finds that the benefits to the State from providing those businesses far exceeds  the costs 1 
to the State of providing the incentives provided in this legislation and that the provisions 2 
of this legislation are necessary to accomplish these objectives.  3 
SUMMARY  4 
This bill creates a refundable Maine income tax credit for the construction o r 5 
expansion of major business headquarters in the State as long as certain investment and 6 
employment levels are met.  The refundable so -called headquarters credit is equal to 2% 7 
of the qualified investment per year for 20 years, subject to certain limitati ons. 8 
The bill also allows a taxpayer receiving the headquarters credit to elect to have any 9 
unused credit carry -forward for the research expense tax credit, super credit for 10 
substantial expansions of research and development, jobs and investment tax credit  and 11 
Maine capital investment credit be made refundable for any tax year to the extent of the 12 
headquarters credit.  13
