deposit is calculated as follows. 
A. If the percentage difference shown by the official tabulation between the leading 
candidate and the requesting candidate is 1.5% or less of the total votes cast for that 
office, a deposit is not required. 
B. If the percentage difference shown by the official tabulation between the leading 
candidate and the requesting candidate is more than 1.5% and less than or equal to 
4% of the total votes cast for that office, the deposit is $500. 
C. If the percentage difference shown by the official tabulation between the leading 
candidate and the requesting candidate is more than 4% and less than or equal to 6% 
of the total votes cast for that office, the deposit is $1,000.

candidate and the requesting candidate is more than 8% and less than or equal to 10% 
of the total votes cast for that office, the deposit is $5,000.

B. If the difference shown by the official tabulation between the leading candidate 
and the requesting candidate is more than 1 % of the total votes cast for that office or

reasonable estimate of the cost to the State of performing the first stage of the 
recount, whichever is greater. After completion of the recount, if the recount has not 
changed the result of the election, the Secretary of State shall calculate the actual cost 
of the procedure, which must be paid by the requesting candidate. If the deposit is 
greater than the actual cost, the overpayment must be refunded to the candidate. If 
the actual cost is greater than the deposit, the candidate shall pay the remainder of the

both offices or questions simultaneously.

§738. Statewide referendum ballots 
Except as provided by this section, the method of conducting a recount of a statewide 
referendum is governed by section 737-A. Appeal of challenged or disputed ballots is to 
the Supreme Judicial Court. 
1. Recount request. To request a recount of a statewide referendum, a petition 
signed by 200 or more registered voters must be submitted to the Secretary of State 
within 8 business days after the election. The Secretary of State shall provide a petition 
form for this purpose to any registered voter in the State who requests it within 2 days of 
receiving the request. 
2. Deposit for recount. A representative of the recount petitioners shall pay the 
deposit required by this section when the petition is submitted to the Secretary of State. 
The amount of the deposit is calculated as follows. 
A. If the difference shown by the official tabulation between the yes and the no votes 
is 1 % or less of the total votes cast for that question or not more than 1,000 votes, 
whichever is less, a deposit is not required. Petitioners who are not required to pay a 
deposit pursuant to this subsection may not be charged for the recount regardless of 
whether the procedure changes the result of the election. 
B. If the difference shown by the official tabulation between the yes and the no votes 
is more than 1 % of the total votes cast for that question or more than l,000 votes, 
whichever is less, the deposit is $5,000 or 10% of the reasonable estimate of the cost 
to the State of performing the first stage of the recount, whichever is greater. After 
the completion of the recount, if the recount has not changed the result of the 
election, the Secretary of State shall calculate the cost of the procedure, which must 
be paid by the petitioners. If the deposit is greater than the actual cost, the 
overpayment must be refunded to the petitioners. If the actual cost is greater than the 
deposit, the petitioners shall pay to the State the remainder of the actual cost. Once 
the State Police have taken custody of the ballots and other election materials for the 
first stage of the recount, the deposit made by the petitioners is forfeited to the State 
even if the petitioners withdraw from the recount before the recount begins. If a 
recount reverses the result of the election, the deposit must be returned to the 
petitioners. 
3. Order of recounts. If a ballot contains state and local candidates or questions and 
a recount is requested, the Secretary of State shall determine which requests for recount 
must be honored first when more than one request is presented. If recounts are requested 
for more than one office or referendum question that is included on the same state ballot 
for one or more iurisdictions, the Secretary of State may determine a process for counting 
the ballots for both offices or questions simultaneously.'

one county, the Secretary of State may direct the State Police to retrieve ballots from 
certain jurisdictions so that the recount may be conducted in stages. 
2. The amendment provides for a new deposit and payment structure for recounts for 
statewide offices, congressional offices or county offices that encompass more than one 
county, such as District Attorney, so that a deposit is not required when the difference 
between the leading candidate and the requesting candidate is 1 % or less of the total votes 
cast for that office or not more than 1,000 votes, whichever is less. 
3. The amendment provides that for recounts for a statewide office, congressional 
office or county office that encompasses more than one county when the percentage 
difference exceeds the threshold for a no-deposit recount, the requesting candidate must 
pay a deposit of $5,000 or 10% of the estimated cost of the first stage of the recount, 
whichever is greater. If the recount does not change the result of the election, the 
candidate must pay the actual costs to the State of conducting the recount. If the recount 
reverses the election, the requesting candidate receives a complete refund. 
4. The amendment adopts a new deposit and payment structure for recounts of a 
statewide referendum that is the same as the one provided for statewide candidate 
recounts. 
5. The amendment provides that if recounts are requested for more than one office or 
referendum question that are on the same ballot for one or more jurisdictions, the 
Secretary of State may determine a process for counting the ballots for both of the offices 
or questions simultaneously. 
6. Finally, the amendment removes the provision in current law allowing an 
undeclared write-in candidate to request a recount.
