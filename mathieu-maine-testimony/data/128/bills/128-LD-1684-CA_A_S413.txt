meals under the National School Lunch Program pursuant to subchapter 7 shall establish

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment changes 
the title and strikes the bill. The amendment: 
1. Requires a public school that provides National School Lunch Program meals to 
students pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A, chapter 223, subchapter 7 or 
otherwise provides to students meals eligible for reimbursement under a program 
administered by the United States Department of Agriculture to provide such a meal to a 
student who requests the meal and is otherwise eligible for the meal regardless of the 
student's ability to pay for the meal or failure in the past to pay for meals; 
2. Prohibits a public school from openly identifying or stigmatizing a student who 
cannot pay for a meal or who has payments due for previous meals; 
3. Requires a public school to communicate about a student's meal debts directly to 
the parent or guardian of the student rather than to the student; and 
4. Requires the school board of a public school to establish a policy for collection of 
debts owed to the school lunch program. 
The fiscal note on the amendment identifies a requirement in this amendment as a 
potential significant state mandate. In order to be a mandate pursuant to the Constitution 
of Maine, a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or modify its 
activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The committee 
finds that the provisions identified as a potential mandate do not require a local school 
administrative unit to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional 
expenditures from local revenue. 
The committee has determined that the potential state mandate provision prepared by 
the Office of Fiscal and Program Review is not in fact a mandate for public schools. The 
amendment does not require the public school to pay for the school meal debts, since the 
amendment requires the public school to directly communicate with a parent or guardian 
about the student's meal debts and requires the school board of the public school to 
establish a policy for the collection of debts owed to the school lunch program.

Requires public schools that provide meals to students under the National School School

Moderate

While the cost to local school administrative units to provide meals to certain students may be significant, the required 
collection policy for debts owed to the school lunch program may help mitigate some of the costs over the long-term, 
depending on what policies are put in place.
