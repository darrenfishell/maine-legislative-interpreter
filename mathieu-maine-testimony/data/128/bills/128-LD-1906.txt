11 conspicuously displayed  in the licensee's place of business in letters at least 3/8 inches

13 person who violates this subsection commits a civil violation  for which  a forfeiture of not 
14 less than $50 nor more  than  $200  may  be adjudged for any  one offense.
15 Sec. 3.  22 MRSA  §1553-A, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2017, c. 308, §5, is 
16 further amended  to read:
17 1.  Vending requirements.   When the sale of cigarettes or any other tobacco product 
18 is made  from a  vending machine the following is required.
19 A.  Only cigarettes or any other tobacco products  may be dispensed by that  machine.
20 B.  A sign must be  affixed  conspicuously to the front of the machine.  The  sign must:
21 (1)  Contain lettering that is at least 3/8 inches  in height;  and
22 (2)  State the following:  "WARNING.   It is unlawful  to sell tobacco products in 
23 this State  to for any person who has not attained  21 years of age, unless the 
24 person has attained  18 years  of age as of July 1, 2018 under 18 years of age to 
25 purchase cigarettes in this State."
26 D.  At all times during  the hours the vending machine is accessible, it must be located 
27 within the unobstructed line of sight  and under the direct supervision of an adult.   
28 That adult is responsible  for preventing  persons under 18 years  of age from  
29 purchasing cigarettes or any  other tobacco product  from that vending  machine.
30 Vending machines may be located only in areas in which  persons  who are 21 years  of age

33 by PL 2017,  c. 308, §6, are further amended to read:
34 1.  Retail sales.   Tobacco  products may be sold at retail only in a direct, face-to- face 
35 exchange in which the purchaser may be clearly identified.  For direct, face-to-face sales,

37 is 17 years of age or older  and under 21 years  of age may sell tobacco products  only in

6 18 years of age as of July 1, 2018.  Tobacco products  may not be sold at retail to any 
7 person who has not attained 30 under  27 years of age unless the seller  first verifies that 
8 person's age by means of reliable photographic  identification  containing the person's date 
9 of birth.  That a person  appeared  to be 30 years  of age or older  does not constitute  a 
10 defense to a violation of this section.
11 4.  Wholesale sales.  Tobacco products  may be distributed at wholesale without a 
12 face-to- face exchange only in the normal course of trade and under procedures approved

22 A person who has not attained 21 under 18 years of age may transport  or permit  to be 
23 transported in a motor vehicle  tobacco products in the original sealed  package in which 
24 they were placed by the manufacturer if the transportation  is in the scope  of that person's 
25 employment.
26 5-C.  Use of false  identification  by persons who have not attained 18 years  of age 
27 prohibited.  A person  who has not attained 21 under 18 years of age may not:

34 age.  A dealer or distributor  of tobacco products shall post notice of this section  
35 prohibiting tobacco product  sales to persons who have not attained 21 under  18 years of 
36 age, unless the person  has attained 18 years of age as of July 1, 2018.  Notices must be
