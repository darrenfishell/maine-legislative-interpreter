SUMMARY  5 
This bill amends the law regarding the transfer of funds from the Regional 6 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund to the Public Utilities Commission for the purpose 7 
of the commission's making  disbursements to affected manufacturing customers in 8 
proportion to their retail purchase of electricity.  The bill removes the requirement to 9 
transfer $3,000,000 per year and instead directs the commission to determine the total 10 
amount to be disbursed bas ed on a percentage.  The bill allows affected customers to opt 11 
out of receiving a disbursement.  The bill requires an affected customer to use the entire 12 
amount disbursed by the commission toward the cost of an approved efficiency measure 13 
in order for the affected customer to be eligible to receive matching funds from 14 
Efficiency Maine Trust.  15
