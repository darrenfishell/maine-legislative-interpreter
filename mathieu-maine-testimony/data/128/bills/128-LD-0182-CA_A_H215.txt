This bill directs the Depa1tment of Environmental Protection (DEP) to adopt rnles to implement a prohibition on the 
sale of furniture containing flame retardant chemicals. In order to effectively implement these rules, the DEP has 
indicated it will need to develop a product labeling and registration program for manufacturers and a product 
sampling a·nd testing program for ce1tification. The DEP estimates that 25 products at a cost of $12,500 will be 
purchased annually for product sampling. The laborat01y testing for the product sampling is projected to have an 
annual cost of $12,500. This bill includes annual General Fund appropriations of $25 ,900 starting in fiscal year 2017-
18 for product purchase, testing and technology costs. 
This bill also includes General Fund appropriations of $28,581 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $40,009 in fiscal year 2018-
19 to the DEP for one part-time Environmental Specialist III position to develop and initiate the prohibition program 
and to coordinate laborat01y testing of furniture products.
