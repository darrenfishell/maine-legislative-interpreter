 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง4353, sub -ยง4-C, as amended by PL 2005, c. 244, ยง2, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
4-C.  Variance from dimensional standards.  A municipality may adopt an 4 
ordinance that permits the board to grant a variance from the dimensional standards of a 5 
zoning ordinance when strict application of the ordinance to the petitioner and the 6 
petitioner's property would cause a practical difficulty and  Except as provided in this 7 
subsection, the bo ard of appeals may grant a variance from the dimensional standards of a 8 
zoning ordinance  when the following conditions exist:  9 
A.  The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not 10 
to the  or the variance is consistent with t he general condition of the neighborhood;  11 
B.  The granting of a variance will not produce an undesirable change in the character 12 
of the neighborhood and will not unreasonably detrimentally affect the use or market 13 
value of abutting properties;  14 
C.  The prac tical difficulty is not the result of action taken by the petitioner or a prior 15 
owner;  16 
D.  No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to the petitioner; and 17 
E.  The granting of a variance will not unreasonably adversely affect the natural 18 
environment ; and . 19 
F.  The property is not located in whole or in part within shoreland areas as described 20 
in Title 38, section 435.  21 
As used in this subsection, "dimensional standards" means and is limited to ordinance 22 
provisions relating to lot area, lot cove rage, frontage , impervious surface space, open 23 
space ratios, yard  and setback requirements.  24 
The provisions of this subsection do not authorize the reduction of dimensional standards 25 
required by the mandatory shoreland zoning laws in Title 38, chapter 3, su bchapter 1, 26 
article 2 -B. 27 
As used in this subsection, "practical difficulty" means that the strict application of the 28 
ordinance to the property precludes the ability of the petitioner to pursue a use permitted 29 
in the zoning district in which the property is  located and results in significant economic 30 
injury to the petitioner.  31 
Under its home rule authority, a municipality may, in an ordinance adopted pursuant to 32 
this subsection  after January 1, 2018 , adopt additional limitations on the granting of a 33 
variance from the dimensional standards of a zoning ordinance.  A zoning ordinance also 34 
may explicitly delegate to the municipal reviewing authority the ability to approve 35 
development proposals that do not meet the dimensional standards otherwise required, in 36 
order  to promote cluster development, to accommodate lots with insufficient frontage or 37 
to provide for reduced setbacks for lots or buildings made nonconforming by municipal 38 
zoning.  As long as the development falls within the parameters of such an ordinance, t he 39 
approval is not considered the granting of a variance.  This delegation of authority does 40 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1236(01) -1 
 not authorize the reduction of dimensional standards required under the mandatory 1 
shoreland zoning laws, Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 2 -B. 2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill provides a municipal board of appeals the authority to grant a variance from 4 
the municipality's dimensional standards if the variance is consistent with the general 5 
condition of the neighborhood and removes the requirement that the variance cause a  6 
practical difficulty.  This bill also includes impervious surface space, open space ratios 7 
and yard and setback requirements in the meaning of dimensional standards.  8
