3 Whereas, there are unused school facilities at the Maine Educational Center for the

14 unused school  facilities  by May  1, 2018; and

16 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
17 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now,
