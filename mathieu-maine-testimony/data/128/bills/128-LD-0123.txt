In proceedings under this Code, the rules of evidence in courts of general jurisdiction, 17

are applica ble. 21 
1.  Application of Uniform Determination of Death Act.  Death occurs when an 22 
individual is determined to be dead under the Uniform Determination of Death Act.  23 
2.  Death certificate as prima facie evidence.  A certified or authenticated copy of a 24

death and the identity of the decedent.  27 
3.  Government record as prima facie eviden ce.  A certified or authenticated copy 28

 6.  Document as evidence  of time of death.  In the absence of evidence disputing 1 
the time of death stated on a document described in subsection 2 or 3, a document 2 
described in subsection 2 or 3 that states a time of death 120 hours or more after the time 3 
of death of another indiv idual, however the time of death of the other individual is 4 
determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the 5

§1-107.  Acts by holder of general power  7 
For the purpose of granting consen t or approval with regard to the acts or accounts of 8

interest s, as objects, takers in default or otherwise, are subject to the power.  14 
§1-108.  Cost -of-living adjustment of certain dollar amounts  15 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 16 
following terms have the following meanings.  17 
A.  "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index, Annual Average, for 18 
All Urban Consumers, CPI -U: U.S. City Average, All items, reported by the United 19 
States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or its successor or, if the 20 
index is discontinued, an equivalent index reported by a federal authority or, if no 21 
such index is reported, "Consumer Price Index" means a comparable index chosen by 22 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  23 
B.  "Reference base index" means the Consumer Price Index f or calendar year 2017.  24 
2.  Automatic adjustment of amounts for inflation.  The dollar amounts stated in 25 
sections 2 -102, 2 -402, 2 -403 and 2 -405 apply to the estate of a decedent who died in or 26 
after 2017, but for the estate of a decedent who died after 2018 , these dollar amounts 27 
must be increased or decreased if the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 28 
immediately preceding the year of death exceeds or is less than the reference base index.  29 
The amount of any increase or decrease is computed by multipl ying each dollar amount 30 
by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year immediately 31 
preceding the year of death exceeds or is less than the reference base index.  If any 32 
increase or decrease produced by the computation is not a mu ltiple of $100, the increase 33 
or decrease is rounded down, if an increase, or up, if a decrease, to the next multiple of 34 
$100, but for the purpose of section 2 -405, the periodic installment amount is the lump - 35 
sum amount divided by 12.  If the Consumer Price  Index for 2018 is changed by the 36 
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reference base index 37 
must be revised using the rebasing factor reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or 38 
other comparable data if a rebasing factor is not reported.  39

§1-110.  Powers of fiduciaries relating to compliance with environmental laws  5 
1.  Fiduciary powers to comply with environmental law.  From the inception of 6 
the trust or estate, a fiduciary has the following powers, without court authorization, 7 
which the fiduciar y may use in the fiduciary's sole discretion to comply with 8 
environmental law:  9 
A.  To inspect and monitor property held by the fiduciary, including interests in sole 10 
proprietorships, partnerships or corporations and any assets owned by any such 11 
business en terprise, for the purpose of determining compliance with environmental 12 
law affecting the property and to respond to any actual or threatened violation of any 13 
environmental law affecting the property held by the fiduciary;  14 
B.  To take, on behalf of the trus t or estate, any action necessary to prevent, abate or 15 
otherwise remedy any actual or threatened violation of any environmental law 16 
affecting property held by the fiduciary, either before or after the initiation of an 17 
enforcement action by any governmental  body;  18 
C.  To refuse to accept property if the fiduciary determines that any property to be 19 
donated to the trust or estate either is contaminated by any hazardous substance or is 20 
being used or has been used for any activity directly or indirectly involving  any 21 
hazardous substance that could result in liability to the trust or estate or otherwise 22 
impair the value of the assets held in the trust or estate.  This paragraph does not 23 
apply to property in the trust or estate at its inception;  24 
D.  To settle or com promise at any time any claims against the trust or estate that may 25 
be asserted by any governmental body or private party involving the alleged violation 26 
of any environmental law affecting property held in trust or in an estate;  27 
E.  To disclaim any power g ranted by any document, statute or rule of law that, in the 28 
sole discretion of the fiduciary, may cause the fiduciary to incur personal liability 29 
under any environmental law; and  30 
F.  To decline to serve or to resign as a fiduciary if the fiduciary reasonab ly believes 31 
that there is or may be a conflict of interest between the fiduciary's fiduciary capacity 32 
and the fiduciary's individual capacity because of potential claims or liabilities that 33 
may be asserted against the fiduciary on behalf of the trust or es tate because of the 34 
type or condition of assets held in the trust or estate.  35 
2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this section, "environmental law" means any federal, 36 
state or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance relating to protection of the environment 37 
or human health.  For purposes of this section, "hazardous substance" has the meaning set 38 
forth in Title 38, section 1362, subsection 1.  39 
3.  Costs assessed to trust or estate.  The fiduciary may charge the cost of any 40 
inspection, review, abatement, respons e, cleanup or remedial action authorized in this 41 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 section against the income or principal of the trust or estate.  A fiduciary is not personally 1 
liable to any beneficiary or other party for any decrease in value of assets in trust or in an 2 
estate by reason of the fiduciary's compliance with any environmental law, specifically 3 
including any reporting requirement under the law.  Neither the acceptance by the 4 
fiduciary of property nor a failure by the fiduciary to inspect property creates an inference 5 
as to whe ther there is or may be any liability under any environmental law with respect to 6 
the property.  7 
4.  Compliance with environmental law not a conflict of interest.  The exercise by 8 
a fiduciary of any of the powers granted in this section does not constitute a transaction 9 
that is affected by a substantial conflict of interest on the part of the fiduciary.  10 
5.  Application and effective date.  This section applies to all trusts and estates in 11 
existence on and created after July 1, 1994.  12

consented to in writing before or after the transfer by, the surviving spouse.  11

value, and under only one overlapping provision if they all yield the same value.  24 
§2-209.  Sources from which elective share payable  25 
1.  Elective -share amount only.  In a proceeding for an elective share, the foll owing 26 
are applied first to satisfy the elective -share amount and to reduce or eliminate any 27 
contributions due from the decedent's probate estate and recipients of the decedent's 28 
nonprobate transfers to others:  29 
A.  Amounts included in the augmented estate u nder section 2 -204 that pass or have 30 
passed to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession and amounts 31 
included in the augmented estate under section 2 -206; and  32 
B.  The marital -property portion of amounts included in the augmented estate under 33 
section 2 -207. 34 
2.  Marital -property portion.  The marital -property portion under subsection 1, 35 
paragraph B is computed by multiplying the value of the amounts included in the 36 
augmented estate under section 2 -207 by the percentage of the augmented estate se t forth 37 
 
 Page 44 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 in the schedule in section 2 -203, subsection 2 appropriate to the length of time the spouse 1 
and the decedent were married to each other.  2 
3.  Unsatisfied balance of elective -share amount; net probate estate.  If, after the 3 
application of subsection 1, the elective -share amount is not fully satisfied, or the 4 
surviving spouse is entitled to a supplemental elective -share amount, amounts included in 5 
the decedent's net probate estate, other than assets passing to the surviving spouse by 6 
testate or intesta te succession, and in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others under 7 
section 2 -205, subsections 1 and 2 and section 2 -205, subsection 3, paragraph B are 8 
applied first to satisfy the unsatisfied balance of the elective -share amount or the 9 
supplemental elective -share amount.  The decedent's net probate estate and that portion of 10 
the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others are applied so that liability for the 11 
unsatisfied balance of the elective -share amount or for the supplemental elective -share 12 
amount  is apportioned among the recipients of the decedent's net probate estate and of 13 
that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of 14 
their interests therein.  15 
4.  Unsatisfied balance of elective share; nonprobate tran sfers.  If, after the 16 
application of subsections 1 and 2, the elective -share or supplemental elective -share 17 
amount is not fully satisfied, the remaining portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers 18 
to others is applied so that liability for the unsatisfi ed balance of the elective -share or 19 
supplemental elective -share amount is apportioned among the recipients of the remaining 20 
portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their 21 
interests therein.  22 
5.  Unsatisfied bala nce treated as general pecuniary devise.  The unsatisfied 23 
balance of the elective -share or supplemental elective -share amount as determined under 24 
subsection 3 or 4 is treated as a general pecuniary devise for purposes of section 3 -904. 25 
§2-210.  Personal li ability of recipients  26 
1.  Original recipients; satisfaction of elective -share amount.  Only original 27 
recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, and the donees of the 28 
recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others to the exten t the donees have 29 
the property or its proceeds, are liable to make a proportional contribution toward 30 
satisfaction of the surviving spouse's elective -share amount.  A person liable to make a 31 
contribution may choose to give up the proportional part of the d ecedent's nonprobate 32 
transfers to that person or to pay the value of the amount for which that person is liable.  33 
2.  Preemption; obligated and personally liable.  If any section or part of any 34 
section of this Part is preempted by federal law with respect t o a payment, an item of 35 
property or any other benefit included in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, a 36 
person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property or any other benefit is 37 
obligated to return the payment, item of property o r benefit or is personally liable for the 38 
amount of the payment or the value of that item of property or benefit, as provided in 39 
section 2 -209, to the person who would have been entitled to it were that section or part 40 
of that section not preempted.  41 
 
 Page 45 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §2-211.  Proceeding for elective share; time limit  1 
1.  Time of election.  Except as provided in subsection 2, the surviving spouse or the 2 
surviving spouse's conservator or agent under authority of a power of attorney must make 3 
the election by filing in the court  and mailing or delivering to the personal representative, 4 
if any, a petition for the elective share within 9 months after the date of the decedent's 5 
death or within 6 months after the probate of the decedent's will, whichever limitation 6 
later expires.  No tice of the time and place set for the hearing must be given to persons 7 
interested in the estate and to the distributees and recipients of portions of the augmented 8 
estate whose interests will be adversely affected by the taking of the elective share.  9 
Except as provided in subsection 2, the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others are not 10 
included within the augmented estate for the purpose of computing the elective share if 11 
the petition is filed more than 9 months after the decedent's death.  12 
2.  Extensio n.  Within 9 months after the decedent's death, a petition for an extension 13 
of time for making an election may be filed by the surviving spouse or the surviving 14 
spouse's conservator or agent under authority of a power of attorney.  If, within 9 months 15 
after the decedent's death, notice is given of the petition to all persons interested in the 16 
decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, the court for cause shown may extend the time 17 
for election.  If the court grants the petition for an extension, the decedent 's nonprobate 18 
transfers to others are not excluded from the augmented estate for the purpose of 19 
computing the elective -share amount, if the election is made by filing in the court and 20 
mailing or delivering to the personal representative, if any, a petition  for the elective 21 
share within the time allowed by the extension.  22 
3.  Withdrawal of demand.  A demand for an elective share may be withdrawn at 23 
any time before entry of a final determination by the court.  24 
4.  Court determination.  After notice and hearing,  the court shall determine the 25 
elective -share amount, and shall order its payment from the assets of the augmented 26 
estate or by contribution as appears appropriate under sections 2 -209 and 2 -210.  If it 27 
appears that a fund or property included in the augme nted estate has not come into the 28 
possession of the personal representative, or has been distributed by the personal 29 
representative, the court nevertheless shall fix the liability of any person who has any 30 
interest in the fund or property or who has posses sion thereof, whether as trustee or 31 
otherwise.  The proceeding may be maintained against fewer than all persons against 32 
whom relief could be sought, but a person is not subject to contribution in any greater 33 
amount than the person would have been under sec tions 2 -209 and 2 -210 had relief been 34 
secured against all persons subject to contribution.  35 
5.  Enforcement.  An order or judgment of the court may be enforced as necessary in 36 
suit for contribution or payment in other courts of this State or other jurisdict ions.  37 
§2-212.  Right of election personal to surviving spouse  38 
The right of election may be exercised only by a surviving spouse who is living when 39 
the petition for the elective share is filed in the court under section 2 -211, subsection 1.  If 40 
the election  is not exercised by the surviving spouse personally, it may be exercised on 41 
 
 Page 46 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the surviving spouse's behalf by the surviving spouse's conservator or agent under 1 
authority of a power of attorney.  2 
§2-213.  Waiver of right to elect and of other rights  3 
1.  Waiv er of election and statutory benefits.  The right of election of a surviving 4 
spouse and the rights of the surviving spouse to homestead allowance, exempt property 5 
and family allowance may be waived, wholly or partially, before or after marriage, by a 6 
writt en contract, agreement or waiver signed by the surviving spouse.  7 
2.  Waiver not enforceable.  A surviving spouse's waiver is not enforceable if the 8 
surviving spouse proves that:  9 
A.  The surviving spouse did not execute the waiver voluntarily; or  10 
B.  The w aiver was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of 11 
the waiver, the surviving spouse:  12 
(1)  Was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial 13 
obligations of the decedent;  14 
(2)  Did not voluntarily and expressly  waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of 15 
the property or financial obligations of the decedent beyond the disclosure 16 
provided; and  17 
(3)  Did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of 18 
the property or financial obligations of the decedent.  19 
3.  Unconscionability.  An issue of unconscionability of a waiver is for decision by 20 
the court as a matter of law.  21 
4.  Waiver of "all rights."  Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of "all 22 
rights," or equivalent language, in the prope rty or estate of a present or prospective 23 
spouse or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation 24 
or divorce is a waiver of all rights of elective share, homestead allowance, exempt 25 
property and family allowance by each  spouse in the property of the other and a 26 
renunciation by each of all benefits that would otherwise pass to the spouse from the 27 
other by intestate succession or by virtue of any will executed before the waiver or 28 
property settlement.  29 
§2-214.  Protection o f payors and other 3rd parties  30 
1.  Liability of payors and other 3rd parties.  Although under section 2 -205 a 31 
payment, item of property or other benefit is included in the decedent's nonprobate 32 
transfers to others, a payor or other 3rd party is not liable for having made a payment or 33 
transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing 34 
instrument, or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the validity of a 35 
governing instrument, upon request and sat isfactory proof of the decedent's death, before 36 
the payor or other 3rd party received written notice from the surviving spouse or spouse's 37 
representative of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for 38 
the elective share ha s been filed.  A payor or other 3rd party is liable for payments made 39 
 
 Page 47 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 or other actions taken after the payor or other 3rd party received written notice that a 1 
petition for the elective share has been filed.  2 
2.  Notice to payors and other 3rd parties.  A wr itten notice of intention to file a 3 
petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed must 4 
be mailed to the payor's or other 3rd party's main office or home by registered or certified 5 
mail, return receipt requested, o r served upon the payor or other 3rd party in the same 6 
manner as a summons in a civil action.  Upon receipt of written notice of intention to file 7 
a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed, a 8 
payor or other 3rd party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of 9 
property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings 10 
relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with 11 
the court h aving jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located 12 
in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or item of 13 
property and, upon its determination under section 2 -211, subsection 4, shall order 14 
disbu rsement in accordance with the determination.  If no petition is filed in the court 15 
within the specified time under section 2 -211, subsection 1 or, if filed, the demand for an 16 
elective share is withdrawn under section 2 -211, subsection 3, the court shall o rder 17 
disbursement to the designated beneficiary.  Payments or transfers to the court or deposits 18 
made into court discharge the payor or other 3rd party from all claims for amounts so 19 
paid or the value of property so transferred or deposited.  20 
3.  Petition b y beneficiary; court order.  Upon petition to the court by the 21 
beneficiary designated in a governing instrument, the court may order that all or part of 22 
the property be paid to the beneficiary in an amount and subject to conditions consistent 23 
with this Par t. 24

testator's estate as follows:  23 
(1)  The p ortion of the testator's estate in which the omitted after -born or after - 24 
adopted child is entitled to share is limited to devises made to the testator's then - 25 
living children under the will;  26 
(2)  The omitted after -born or after -adopted child is entitled to receive the share 27 
of the testator's estate, as limited in subparagraph (1), that the child would have 28 
received had the testator included all omitted after -born and after -adopted 29 
children with the children to whom devises were made under the will and had 30 
given an equal share of the estate to each child;  31 
(3)  To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted after -born or after - 32 
adopted child under this paragraph must be of the same character, whether 33 
equitable or legal, present or future, as that devise d to the testator's then -living 34 
children under the will; and  35 
(4)  In satisfying a share provided by this paragraph, devises to the testator's 36 
children who were living when the will was executed abate ratably.  In abating 37 
the devises of the then -living chil dren, the court shall preserve to the maximum 38 
extent possible the character of the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.  39 
2.  No shares for omitted children.  Neither subsection 1, paragraph A nor 40 
subsection 1, paragraph B applies if:  41 
 
 Page 49 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 A.  It appears fr om the will that the omission was intentional; or  1 
B.  The testator provided for the omitted after -born or after -adopted child by transfer 2 
outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision 3 
is shown by the testator's st atements or is reasonably inferred from the amount of the 4 
transfer or other evidence.  5 
3.  Child believed to be dead.  If at the time of execution of the will the testator fails 6 
to provide in the testator's will for a living child solely because the testato r believes the 7 
child to be dead, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted 8 
after-born or after -adopted child.  9 
4.  Shares abate.  In satisfying a share provided by subsection 1, paragraph A, 10 
devises made by the will abate under section 3 -902. 11 
PART 4  12 
EXEMPT PROPERTY AND ALLOWANCES  13 
§2-401.  Applicable law  14 
This Part applies to the estate of the decedent who dies domiciled in this State.  15 
Rights to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance for a decedent 16 
who die s not domiciled in this State are governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at 17 
death.  18 
§2-402.  Homestead allowance  19 
A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $22,500.  If 20 
there is no surviving spouse, each minor child and ea ch dependent child of the decedent is 21 
entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $22,500 divided by the number of minor 22 
and dependent children of the decedent.  The homestead allowance is exempt from and 23 
has priority over all claims against the estate.   Homestead allowance is in addition to any 24 
share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the decedent's will 25 
unless otherwise provided by intestate succession or by way of elective share.  26 
§2-403.  Exempt property  27 
In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled 28 
from the estate to a value, not exceeding $15,000 in excess of any security interests in the 29 
estate, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances and personal effects.  30 
If the re is no surviving spouse, children of the decedent are entitled jointly to the same 31 
value; however, the decedent, by will, may exclude one or more adult children from the 32 
receipt of exempt property.  If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in ex cess of 33 
security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $15,000, or if there is 34 
not $15,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children are entitled to 35 
other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to m ake up the $15,000 value.  36 
Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property 37 
have priority over all claims against the estate, except that the right to any assets to make 38 
up a deficiency of exempt property abates as nec essary to permit earlier payment of 39 
 
 Page 50 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 homestead allowance and family allowance.  These rights are in addition to any benefit or 1 
share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent's will unless otherwise 2 
provided by intestate succession or by w ay of elective share.  3 
§2-404.  Family allowance  4 
1.  Family allowance during administration.  In addition to the right to homestead 5 
allowance and exempt property, the decedent's surviving spouse and minor children 6 
whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being 7 
supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the 8 
estate for their maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance may 9 
not continue for longer than one year if the esta te is inadequate to discharge allowed 10 
claims.  The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments.  It is 11 
payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor 12 
and dependent children; otherwise to the ch ildren, or persons having their care and 13 
custody.  If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the 14 
allowance may be made partially to the child or the child's guardian or other person 15 
having the child's care and custody, an d partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear.  16 
The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims but not over the 17 
homestead allowance.  18 
2.  Not chargeable against benefit or share; right terminates on death.  The 19 
family allowance is not chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving 20 
spouse or children by the decedent's will unless otherwise provided by intestate 21 
succession or by way of elective share.  The death of any person entitled to family 22 
allowance terminate s that person's right to allowance not yet paid.  23 
§2-405.  Source, determination and documentation  24 
If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to 25 
satisfy rights to homestead and exempt property.  Subject to this rest riction, the surviving 26 
spouse, the guardians of minor children or children who are adults may select property of 27 
the estate as homestead allowance and exempt property.  The personal representative may 28 
make these selections if the surviving spouse, the chil dren or the guardians of the minor 29 
children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or there is no guardian of a 30 
minor child.  The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of 31 
distribution to establish the ownership of property  taken as homestead allowance or 32 
exempt property.  The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a 33 
lump sum not exceeding $27,000 or periodic installments not exceeding $2,250 per 34 
month for one year, and may disburse funds of the estate  in payment of the family 35 
allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash.  The personal 36 
representative or any interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, 37 
payment, proposed payment or failure to act under this section may  petition the court for 38 
appropriate relief, which relief may include a family allowance other than that which the 39 
personal representative determined or could have determined.  40

document are in the testator's handwriting.  15 
3.  Extrinsic evidence.  Intent that a document constitute the testator's will may be 16 
established by extrinsic evidence, including, for holographic wills, portio ns of the 17 
document that are not in the testator's handwriting.  18 
§2-503.  Self -proved will  19 
1.  Self-proved at execution.  Any will may be simultaneously executed, attested and 20

3.  Affidavit sufficient.  A signature affixed to a self -proving affidavit attached to a 7 
will is considered a signature affixed to the will, if necessary to  prove the will's due 8 
execution.  9 
§2-504.  Who may witness a will  10 
1.  Witness.  An individual generally competent to be a witness may act as a witness 11 
to a will.  12 
2.  Interested witness.  The signing of a will by an interested witness does not 13 
invalidate the  will or any portion of it.  14 
§2-505.  Choice of law as to execution  15 
A written will is valid if executed in compliance with section 2 -502 or if its execution 16 
complies with the law at the time of execution of the place where the will is executed, or 17 
of the la w of the place where at the time of execution or at the time of death the testator is 18 
domiciled, has a place of abode or is a national or if executed in compliance with 10 19 
United States Code, Section 1044d.  20 
§2-506.  Revocation by writing or by act  21 
1.  Revo cation.  A will or any part thereof is revoked:  22 
A.  By the execution of a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or part 23 
expressly or by inconsistency; or  24 
B.  By the performance of a revocatory act on the will, if the testator performs the act 25 
with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the will or part or if another individual 26 
performs the act in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction.  27 
For purposes of this paragraph, "revocatory act on the will" includes burning, tea ring, 28 
canceling, obliterating or destroying the will or any part of it.  A burning, tearing or 29 
canceling is a revocatory act on the will, whether or not the burn, tear or cancellation 30 
touched any of the words on the will.  31 
2.  Intent to replace previous wil l.  If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a 32 
previous will, the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous will by 33  (Signed) ..........................................................  
 ...................................................................  
 (Official capacity of officer)  
 
 Page 54 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will to replace rather than 1 
supplement the previous will.  2 
3.  Presumption of intent to replace.  The testator is presumed to have intended a 3 
subsequent will to replace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent will 4 
makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate.  If this presumption arises and is not 5 
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the previous will is revoked; only the 6 
subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.  7 
4.  Presumption of intent to supplement.  The testator is presumed to have intended 8 
a subsequent will to suppleme nt rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent will 9 
does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate.  If this presumption arises 10 
and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will revokes the 11 
previous will onl y to the extent the subsequent will is inconsistent with the previous will; 12 
each will is fully operative on the testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.  13 
§2-507.  Revocation by change of circumstances  14 
Except as provided in sections 2 -802, 2 -803 and 2 -804, a change of circumstances 15 
does not revoke a will or any part of it.  16 
§2-508.  Revival of revoked will  17 
1.  Subsequent will revoked by revocatory act; wholly revoked previous will.  If a 18 
subsequent will that wholly revoked a previous will is t hereafter revoked by a revocatory 19 
act under section 2 -506, subsection 1, paragraph B, the previous will remains revoked 20 
unless it is revived.  The previous will is revived if it is evident from the circumstances of 21 
the revocation of the subsequent will or from the testator's contemporary or subsequent 22 
declarations that the testator intended the previous will to take effect as executed.  23 
2.  Subsequent will revoked by revocatory act; partly revoked previous will.  If a 24 
subsequent will that partly revoked a pr evious will is thereafter revoked by a revocatory 25 
act under section 2 -506, subsection 1, paragraph B, a revoked part of the previous will is 26 
revived unless it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of the subsequent 27 
will or from the testator's  contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator did 28 
not intend the revoked part to take effect as executed.  29 
3.  Subsequent will revoked by later will.  If a subsequent will that revoked a 30 
previous will in whole or in part is thereafter revoked b y another, later will, the previous 31 
will remains revoked in whole or in part, unless it or its revoked part is revived.  The 32 
previous will or its revoked part is revived to the extent it appears from the terms of the 33 
later will that the testator intended t he previous will to take effect.  34 
§2-509.  Incorporation by reference  35 
Any writing in existence when a will is executed may be incorporated by reference if 36 
the language of the will manifests this intent and describes the writing sufficiently to 37 
permit its id entification.  38 
 
 Page 55 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §2-510.  Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act  1 
1.  Devise to a trust.  A will may validly devise property to the trustee of a trust 2 
established or to be established:  3 
A.  During the testator's lifetime by the testator, by the testator a nd some other person 4 
or by some other person, including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, 5 
although the settlor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance 6 
contracts; or  7 
B.  At the testator's death by the testator's devise to the t rustee, if the trust is identified 8 
in the testator's will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument, other than a 9 
will, executed before, concurrently with or after the execution of the testator's will or 10 
in another individual's will if that other  individual has predeceased the testator, 11 
regardless of the existence, size or character of the corpus of the trust.  12 
The devise is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable or because the trust 13 
was amended after the execution of the will or t he testator's death.  14 
2.  Not held under testamentary trust.  Unless the testator's will provides 15 
otherwise, property devised to a trust described in subsection 1 is not held under a 16 
testamentary trust of the testator but becomes a part of the trust to whic h it is devised and 17 
must be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing 18 
instrument setting forth the terms of the trust, including any amendments thereto made 19 
before or after the testator's death.  20 
3.  Revocation or termi nation before death.  Unless the testator's will provides 21 
otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator's death causes the 22 
devise to lapse.  23 
§2-511.  Events of independent significance  24 
A will may dispose of property by reference to  acts and events that have significance 25 
apart from their effect upon the dispositions made by the will, whether they occur before 26 
or after the execution of the will or before or after the testator's death.  The execution or 27 
revocation of a will of another person is such an event.  28 
§2-512.  Separate writing identifying devise of certain types of tangible personal 29 
property  30 
Whether or not the provisions relating to holographic wills apply, a will may refer to 31 
a written statement or list to dispose of items of t angible personal property not otherwise 32 
specifically disposed of by the will, other than money.  To be admissible under this 33 
section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing must be in the handwriting of 34 
the testator or be signed by the testato r and must describe the items and the devisees with 35 
reasonable certainty.  The writing may be referred to as one to be in existence at the time 36 
of the testator's death; it may be prepared before or after the execution of the will; it may 37 
be altered by the testator after its preparation; and it may be a writing that has no 38 
significance apart from its effect upon the dispositions made by the will.  39 
 
 Page 56 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §2-513.  Contracts concerning succession  1 
A contract to make a will or devise, or not to revoke a will or devise, or to die 2 
intestate, if executed after the effective date of this Act, can be established only by:  3 
1.  Material provisions.  Provisions of a will stating material provisions of the 4 
contract;  5 
2.  Express reference, extrinsic evidence.  An express reference in a will to a 6 
contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract; or  7 
3.  Writing evidencing the contract.  A writing signed by the decedent evidencing 8 
the contract.  9 
The execution of a joint will or mutual wills does not create a presumption  of a 10 
contract not to revoke the will or wills.  11 
§2-514.  Disposition of will deposited with court  12 
A will deposited for safekeeping with the court in the office of the register before 13 
September 19, 1997 may be delivered only to the testator or to a person a uthorized in 14 
writing signed by the testator to receive the will.  A conservator may be allowed to 15 
examine a deposited will of a protected testator under procedures designed to maintain 16 
the confidential character of the document to the extent possible and t o ensure that it will 17 
be resealed and left on deposit after the examination.  Upon being informed of the 18 
testator's death, the court shall notify any person designated to receive the will and deliver 19 
it to that designated person on request; or the court ma y deliver the will to the appropriate 20 
court.  The court may not accept a will for safekeeping after September 19, 1997.  21 
§2-515.  Duty of custodian of will; liability  22 
After the death of a testator, a person having custody of a will of the testator shall 23 
deliver it with reasonable promptness to a person able to secure its probate or, if no such 24 
person is known, to an appropriate court for filing and recording until probate is sought.  25 
A person having custody of a will is not liable, to any person aggrieved, f or failure to 26 
learn of the death of the testator of that will and the failure, therefore, to deliver that will 27 
as required.  A person who willfully fails to deliver a will or who willfully defaces or 28 
destroys any will of a deceased person is liable to any person aggrieved for the damages 29 
that may be sustained by such failure to deliver or by such defacement or destruction.  A 30 
person who willfully refuses or fails to deliver a will, or who defaces or destroys it, after 31 
being ordered by the court in a proceed ing brought for the purpose of compelling delivery 32 
is subject to penalty for contempt of court.  33 
§2-516.  Penalty clause for contest  34 
A provision in a will purporting to penalize an interested person for contesting the 35 
will or instituting other proceedings r elating to the estate is unenforceable if probable 36 
cause exists for instituting proceedings.  37

2.  Forms provided.  Forms for executing a statutory will must be provided at all 33 
probate courts for a cost equivalent to the reasonable cost of printing and storing the 34 
forms.  The p robate courts shall make the statutory will form available via the Internet for 35 
free printing by anyone choosing to use the form.  A statutory will is deemed to be valid 36 
if the blanks are filled in with a typewriter or in the handwriting of the person maki ng the 37 
will. Failure to complete or mark through any section or part of a section in the statutory 38 
will does not invalidate the entire will.  Failure to sign any section or part of a section in 39

 the statutory will requiring a signature invalidates only the part not signed, except as 1 
specifically provided in paragraph 2.4.  2 
PART 6  3 
RULES OF CONSTRUCTIO N APPLICABLE ONLY TO  WILLS  4 
§2-601.  Scope  5 
In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this 6 
Part control the construction of a will.  7 
§2-602.  Will may pass all property and after -acquired property  8 
A will may provide for the passage of all property the testator owns at death and all 9 
property acquired by the estate after the testator’s death.  10 
§2-603.  Antilapse; deceased devisee; class gifts  11 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 12 
following terms have the following meanings.  13 
A.  "Alternative devise" means a devise that is expressly created by a will and, under 14 
the terms of the will, ca n take effect instead of another devise on the happening of 15 
one or more events, including survival of the testator or failure to survive the testator, 16 
whether an event is expressed in condition -precedent, condition -subsequent or any 17 
other form.  A residuar y clause constitutes an alternative devise with respect to a 18 
nonresiduary devise only if the will specifically provides that, upon lapse or failure, 19 
the nonresiduary devise, or nonresiduary devises in general, pass under the residuary 20 
clause.  21 
B.  "Class me mber" includes an individual who fails to survive the testator but who 22 
would have taken under a devise in the form of a class gift had the individual 23 
survived the testator.  24 
C.  "Descendant of a grandparent" means an individual who qualifies as a descendant  25 
of a grandparent of the testator or of the donor of a power of appointment under the:  26 
(1)  Rules of construction applicable to a class gift created in the testator's will if 27 
the devise or exercise of the power is in the form of a class gift; or  28 
(2)  Rules  for intestate succession if the devise or exercise of the power is not in 29 
the form of a class gift.  30 
D.  "Devise" includes an alternative devise, a devise in the form of a class gift and an 31 
exercise of a power of appointment.  32 
E.  "Devisee" includes:  33 
(1)  A  class member if the devise is in the form of a class gift;  34 
(2)  An individual or class member who was deceased at the time the testator 35 
executed the testator's will as well as an individual or class member who was then 36 
living but who failed to survive th e testator; and  37 
 
 Page 64 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 (3)  An appointee under a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will.  1 
F.  "Stepchild" means a child of the surviving, deceased or former spouse of the 2 
testator or of the donor of a power of appointment and not of the testator or donor.  3 
G.  "Surviving devisee" or "surviving descendant" means a devisee or descendant, 4 
respectively, who neither predeceased the testator nor is deemed to have predeceased 5 
the testator under section 2 -702. 6 
H.  "Testator" includes the donee of a power of a ppointment if the power is exercised 7 
in the testator's will.  8 
2.  Substitute gift.  If a devisee fails to survive the testator and is a grandparent, a 9 
descendant of a grandparent or a stepchild of either the testator or the donor of a power of 10 
appointment e xercised by the testator's will, the following apply.  11 
A.  Except as provided in paragraph D, if the devise is not in the form of a class gift 12 
and the deceased devisee leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in 13 
the devisee's surviving des cendants.  The surviving descendants take per capita at 14 
each generation the property to which the devisee would have been entitled had the 15 
devisee survived the testator.  16 
B.  Except as provided in paragraph D, if the devise is in the form of a class gift, 17 
other than a devise to "issue," "descendants," "heirs of the body," "heirs," "next of 18 
kin," "relatives" or "family," or a class described by language of similar import, a 19 
substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of any deceased devisee.  The 20 
property to which the devisees would have been entitled had all of them survived the 21 
testator passes to the surviving devisees and the surviving descendants of the 22 
deceased devisees.  Each surviving devisee takes the share to which the devisee 23 
would have b een entitled had the deceased devisee survived the testator.  Each 24 
deceased devisee's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased 25 
devisee take per capita at each generation the share to which the deceased devisee 26 
would have been entitled had  the deceased devisee survived the testator.  For the 27 
purposes of this paragraph, "deceased devisee" means a class member who failed to 28 
survive the testator and left one or more surviving descendants.  29 
C.  For the purposes of section 2 -601, words of survivo rship, such as in a devise to an 30 
individual "if he survives me," or in a devise to "my surviving children," are, in the 31 
absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the 32 
application of this section.  33 
D.  If the will create s an alternative devise with respect to a devise for which a 34 
substitute gift is created by paragraph A or B, the substitute gift is superseded by the 35 
alternative devise if:  36 
(1)  The alternative devise is in the form of a class gift and one or more members 37 
of the class is entitled to take under the will; or  38 
(2)  The alternative devise is not in the form of a class gift and the expressly 39 
designated devisee of the alternative devise is entitled to take under the will.  40 
E.  Unless the language creating a power o f appointment expressly excludes the 41 
substitution of the descendants of an appointee for the appointee, a surviving 42 
 
 Page 65 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 descendant of a deceased appointee of a power of appointment may be substituted for 1 
the appointee under this section, whether or not the des cendant is an object of the 2 
power.  3 
"Descendant," in the phrase "surviving descendant," used in reference to a deceased 4 
devisee or class member, means the descendant of a deceased devisee or class member in 5 
paragraphs A and B who would take under a class gi ft created in the testator's will.  6 
3.  More than one substitute gift; which one takes effect.  If, under subsection 2, 7 
substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to more than one devise and 8 
the devises are alternative devises, one to the other, the devised property passes under the 9 
primary substitute gift except that if there is a younger -generation devise, the devised 10 
property passes under the younger -generation substitute gift and not under the primary 11 
substitute gift.  12 
As used in this su bsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 13 
have the following meanings.  14 
A.  "Primary devise" means the devise that would have taken effect had all the 15 
deceased devisees of the alternative devises who left surviving descendants su rvived 16 
the testator.  17 
B.  "Primary substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the 18 
primary devise.  19 
C.  "Younger -generation devise" means a devise that:  20 
(1)  Is to a descendant of a devisee of the primary devise;  21 
(2)  Is an alternative  devise with respect to the primary devise;  22 
(3)  Is a devise for which a substitute gift is created; and  23 
(4)  Would have taken effect had all the deceased devisees who left surviving 24 
descendants survived the testator except the deceased devisee or devisees  of the 25 
primary devise.  26 
D.  "Younger -generation substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect 27 
to the younger -generation devise.  28 
§2-604.  Failure of testamentary provision  29 
1.  Failed devise becomes part of residue.  Except as provided in s ection 2 -603, a 30 
devise, other than a residuary devise, that fails for any reason becomes a part of the 31 
residue.  32 
2.  Failed residuary devise passes in proportion.  Except as provided in section 33 
2-603, if the residue is devised to 2 or more persons, the shar e of a residuary devisee that 34 
fails for any reason passes to the other residuary devisee or to other residuary devisees in 35 
proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the residue.  36 
 
 Page 66 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §2-605.  Increase in securities; accessions  1 
1.  Additional s ecurities.  If a testator executes a will that devises securities and the 2 
testator then owned securities that meet the description in the will, the devise includes 3 
additional securities owned by the testator at death to the extent the additional securities  4 
were acquired by the testator after the will was executed as a result of the testator's 5 
ownership of the described securities and are securities of any of the following types:  6 
A.  Securities of the same organization acquired by reason of action initiated by the 7 
organization or any successor, related or acquiring organization, excluding any 8 
acquired by exercise of purchase options;  9 
B.  Securities of another organization acquired as a result of a merger, consolidation, 10 
reorganization or other distribution by  the organization or any successor, related or 11 
acquiring organization; or  12 
C.  Securities of the same organization acquired as a result of a plan of reinvestment.  13 
2.  Distributions in cash.  Distributions in cash before death with respect to a 14 
described sec urity are not part of the devise under subsection 1.  15 
§2-606.  Nonademption of specific devises; unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation or 16 
insurance; sale by conservator or agent  17 
1.  Specifically devised property.  A specific devisee has a right to specifica lly 18 
devised property in the testator's estate at the testator's death and to:  19 
A.  Any balance of the purchase price, together with any security agreement, owed by 20 
a purchaser at the testator's death by reason of sale of the property;  21 
B.  Any amount of a co ndemnation award for the taking of the property unpaid at 22 
death;  23 
C.  Any proceeds unpaid at death on fire or casualty insurance on or other recovery 24 
for injury to the property;  25 
D.  Any property owned by the testator at death and acquired as a result of 26 
foreclosure, or obtained in lieu of foreclosure, of the security interest for a 27 
specifically devised obligation;  28 
E.  Any real property or tangible personal property owned by the testator at death that 29 
the testator acquired as a replacement for specifically de vised real property or 30 
tangible personal property; and  31 
F.  If not covered by paragraphs A to E, a pecuniary devise equal to the value as of its 32 
date of disposition of other specifically devised property disposed of during the 33 
testator's lifetime but only t o the extent it is established that ademption would be 34 
inconsistent with the testator's manifested plan of distribution or that at the time the 35 
will was made, the date of disposition or otherwise, the testator did not intend 36 
ademption of the devise.  37 
2.  General pecuniary devise from specifically devised property.  If specifically 38 
devised property is sold or mortgaged by a conservator or by an agent acting within the 39 
 
 Page 67 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal, or a condemnation 1 
award, insurance proceeds or recovery for injury to the property is paid to a conservator 2 
or to an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an 3 
incapacitated principal, the specific devisee has the right to a general pecuniary dev ise 4 
equal to the net sale price, the amount of the unpaid loan, the condemnation award, the 5 
insurance proceeds or the recovery.  6 
3.  Reduction of right to general pecuniary devise.  The right of a specific devisee 7 
under subsection 2 is reduced by any right the devisee has under subsection 1.  8 
4.  Survival of testator; incapacity ceased.  For the purposes of the references in 9 
subsection 2 to a conservator, subsection 2 does not apply if, after the sale, mortgage, 10 
condemnation, casualty or recovery, it was adju dicated that the testator's incapacity 11 
ceased and the testator survived the adjudication for at least one year.  12 
5.  Durable power of attorney.  For the purposes of the references in subsection 2 to 13 
an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of  attorney for an incapacitated 14 
principal:  15 
A.  "Incapacitated principal" means a principal who is an incapacitated person;  16 
B.  An adjudication of incapacity before death is not necessary; and  17 
C.  The acts of an agent within the authority of a durable power of attorney are 18 
presumed to be for an incapacitated principal.  19 
§2-607.  Nonexoneration  20 
A specific devise passes subject to any mortgage interest existing at the date of death 21 
without right of exoneration, regardless of a general directive in the will to pa y debts.  22 
§2-608.  Exercise power of appointment  23 
In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a 24 
reference to the power or by an express or specific reference to the power, a general 25 
residuary clause in a will, or a will making  general disposition of all of the testator's 26 
property, expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator 27 
only if:  28 
1.  General power.  The power is a general power exercisable in favor of the 29 
powerholder's estate and the creati ng instrument does not contain an effective gift if the 30 
power is not exercised; or  31 
2.  Intention to include property subject to the power.  The testator's will 32 
manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power.  33 
§2-609.  Ademption by satis faction  34 
1.  Property given during testator's lifetime.  Property a testator gave in the 35 
testator's lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise in whole or in part 36 
only if:  37 
 
 Page 68 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 A.  The will provides for deduction of the gift;  1 
B.  The testator declared in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is in satisfaction 2 
of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise; or  3 
C.  The devisee acknowledged in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise 4 
or that its val ue is to be deducted from the value of the devise.  5 
2.  Partial satisfaction; value.  For purposes of partial satisfaction, property given 6 
during the testator's lifetime is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or 7 
enjoyment of the property or at the testator's death, whichever occurs first.  8 
3.  Devisee fails to survive testator.  If the devisee fails to survive the testator, the 9 
gift described in subsection 1 is treated as a full or partial satisfaction of the devise, as 10 
appropriate, in appl ying sections 2 -603 and 2 -604, unless the testator's contemporaneous 11 
writing provides otherwise.  12 
PART 7  13 
RULES OF CONSTRUCTIO N APPLICABLE TO WILL S AND OTHER 14 
GOVERNING INSTRUMENT S 15 
§2-701.  Scope  16 
In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this 17 
Part control the construction of a governing instrument.  The rules of construction in this 18 
Part apply to a governing instrument of any type, except as the application of a particular 19 
section is limited by its terms to a specific ty pe or types of provision or governing 20 
instrument.  21 
§2-702.  Requirement of survival by 120 hours  22 
1.  Requirement of survival by 120 hours under Code.  For the purposes of this 23 
Code, except as provided in subsection 4, an individual who has not been establis hed by 24 
clear and convincing evidence to have survived an event, including the death of another 25 
individual, by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the event.  26 
2.  Requirement of survival by 120 hours under governing instrument.  Except as 27 
provided in sub section 4, for purposes of a provision of a governing instrument that 28 
relates to an individual surviving an event, including the death of another individual, an 29 
individual who has not been established by clear and convincing evidence to have 30 
survived the e vent by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the event.  31 
3.  Co-owners with right of survivorship; requirement of survival by 120 hours.  32 
Except as provided in subsection 4, if:  33 
A.  It is not established by clear and convincing evidence that one of 2 co -owners 34 
with right of survivorship survived the other co -owner by 120 hours, 1/2 of the 35 
property passes as if one had survived by 120 hours and 1/2 as if the other had 36 
survived by 120 hours; or  37 
 
 Page 69 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 B.  There are more than 2 co -owners with right of survivorship and it is not 1 
established by clear and convincing evidence that at least one of them survived the 2 
others by 120 hours, the property passes in the proportion that one bears to the whole 3 
number of co -owners.  4 
For the purposes of this subsection, "co -owners wi th right of survivorship" includes joint 5 
tenants, tenants by the entireties and other co -owners of property or accounts held under 6 
circumstances that entitle one or more to the whole of the property or account on the 7 
death of the other or others.  8 
4.  Excep tions.  Survival by 120 hours is not required if:  9 
A.  The governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous 10

B.  The governing instrum ent expressly indicates that an individual is not required to 13 
survive an event, including the death of another individual, by any specified period or 14

of the event and th e specified period must be established by clear and convincing 16 
evidence;  17 
C.  The imposition of a 120 -hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested 18 
property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity under Title 19 
33, section 11 1, subsection 1, paragraph A, subsection 2, paragraph A or subsection 20 
3, paragraph A or to become invalid under Title 33, section 111, subsection 1, 21

be established by clear and convincing evidence; or  23 
D.  The application of a 120 -hour requirement of survival to multiple governing 24

of this State otherwise applicable to the disposition.  32

A powerholder's substantial compliance with a formal requirement of appointment 34 
imposed in a governing instrument by the donor, including a requirement that the 35

parents who are not married to each other, and their respective descendants if appropriate 17 
to the class, in accordance with the rules for intestate succession regarding parent -child 18 
relationships.  For the purpose of determining whether a contrary intention exists under 19

5.  Transferor not genetic parent.  In construing a dispositive provision of a 34 
transferor who is not the genetic parent, a child of a genetic parent is not considered the 35 
child of that genetic parent unless the genetic parent, a relative of the gene tic parent or the 36 
spouse or surviving spouse of the genetic parent or of a relative of the genetic parent 37

descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take per capita at e ach 32 
generation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had 33

beneficiary designation to "my surviving childr en," are, in the absence of additional 39 
evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this 40

of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.  27

the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would have been 33 
entitled to it were this section or part of this section not preempted.  34

survivorship" includes words of  survivorship that relate to the distribution date or to 6 
an earlier or an unspecified time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed 7

property passes under the primary substitute gift, except that if there is a younger - 23 
generation future interest, the property passes under the younger -generation substitute gift 24

creating a future interest under the terms of a trust; and  9 
B.  If a taker is not produced by the application of paragraph A, the property passes to 10 
the transferor's heirs under section 2 -711. 11 
For purpose s of this subsection, "transferor" means the donor if the power was a 12 
nongeneral power and means the donee if the power was a general power.  13 
5.  No other taker and future interest created by exercise of power of 14 
appointment.  If, after the application of s ubsections 2 and 3, there is no surviving taker 15 
and if the future interest was created by the exercise of a power of appointment:  16 
A.  The property passes under the donor's gift -in-default clause, if any.  The donor's 17 
gift-in-default clause is treated as cr eating a future interest under the terms of a trust; 18

provided in subsection 4.  21 
§2-708.  Class gifts to "descendants," "issue" or "heirs of the body"; form of 22 
distribu tion if none specified  23 
If a class gift in favor of "descendants," "issue" or "heirs of the body" does not 24 
specify the manner in which the property is to be distributed among the class members, 25 
the property is distributed among the class members who are liv ing when the interest is to 26 
take effect in possession or enjoyment, in such shares as they would receive, under the 27 
applicable law of intestate succession, if the designated ancestor had then died intestate 28 
owning the subject matter of the class gift.  29 
§2-709.  Per capita at each generation; per stirpes or by representation  30 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 31 
following terms have the following meanings.  32 
A.  "Deceased child" or "deceased descendant" means a c hild or a descendant, 33 
respectively, who either predeceased the distribution date or is deemed to have 34 
predeceased the distribution date pursuant to section 2 -702. 35 
B.  "Distribution date," with respect to an interest, means the time when the interest is 36 
to take effect in possession or enjoyment.  The distribution date need not occur at the 37 
beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day.  38 
 
 Page 79 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 C.  "Surviving ancestor," "surviving child" or "surviving descendant" means an 1 
ancestor, a child or a descendant, respectively, who neither predeceased the 2 
distribution date nor is deemed to have predeceased the distribution date pursuant to 3 
section 2 -702. 4 
2.  Per capita at each generation.  If an applicable statute or a governing instru ment 5 
calls for property to be distributed "per capita at each generation," the property is divided 6 
into as many equal shares as there are:  7 
A.  Surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor that 8 
contains one or more surviving de scendants; and  9 
B.  Deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if 10 
any. 11 
Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share.  The 12 
remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same mann er among the 13 
surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who 14 
were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the distribution 15 
date.  16 
3.  Per stirpes or by representation.  If a governing instrumen t calls for property to 17 
be distributed "per stirpes" or "by representation," the property is divided into as many 18 
equal shares as there are:  19 
A.  Surviving children of the designated ancestor; and  20 
B.  Deceased children who left surviving descendants.  21 
Each s urviving child, if any, is allocated one share.  The share of each deceased child 22 
with surviving descendants is divided in the same manner, with subdivision repeating at 23 
each succeeding generation until the property is fully allocated among surviving 24 
desce ndants.  25 
4.  Deceased descendant with no surviving descendant disregarded.  For the 26 
purposes of subsections 2 and 3, an individual who is deceased and left no surviving 27 
descendant is disregarded, and an individual who leaves a surviving ancestor who is a 28 
descendant of the designated ancestor is not entitled to a share.  29 
§2-710.  Worthier -title doctrine abolished  30 
The doctrine of worthier title is abolished as a rule of law and as a rule of 31 
construction.  Language in a governing instrument describing the benefi ciaries of a 32 
disposition as the transferor's "heirs," "heirs at law," "next of kin," "distributees," 33 
"relatives" or "family," or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively 34 
create a reversionary interest in the transferor.  35 
§2-711.  Interes ts in "heirs" and like  36 
If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future 37 
distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual's "heirs," 38 
"heirs at law," "next of kin," "relatives" or "family," or  language of similar import, the 39 
 
 Page 80 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 property passes to those persons, including the State, and in such shares as would succeed 1 
to the designated individual's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the 2 
designated individual's domicile if the de signated individual died when the disposition is 3 
to take effect in possession or enjoyment.  If the designated individual's surviving spouse 4 
is living but is remarried at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or 5 
enjoyment, the surviving spouse is not an heir of the designated individual.  6

§2-801.  Effect of divorce, annulment and decree of separation  10 
1.  Divorce; annulment; separation.  An individual who is divorced from  the 11 
decedent or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled is not a surviving spouse 12 
unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, the individual is married to the decedent at the 13 
time of death.  A decree of separation that does not terminate the stat us of spouses is not a 14 
divorce for purposes of this section.  15 
2.  Not a surviving spouse.  For purposes of Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 and of section 3 -203, 16 
a surviving spouse does not include:  17 
A.  An individual who obtains or consents to a final decree or judgmen t of divorce 18 
from the decedent or an annulment of their marriage, if that decree or judgment is not 19 
recognized as valid in this State, unless they subsequently participate in a marriage 20 
ceremony purporting to marry each to the other, or subsequently live t ogether as 21 
spouses;  22

purporting to terminate all marital property rights.  27 
§2-802.  Effect of homicide on intestate succession, wills, trusts, joint assets, life 28 
insurance and beneficiary designations  29 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the contex t otherwise indicates, the 30 
following terms have the following meanings.  31

property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument.  33 
B.  "Governing instr ument" means a governing instrument executed by the decedent.  34 
C.  "Revocable," with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision or nomination, 35 
means one under which the decedent, at the time of or immediately before death, was 36 
alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the 37 
designation in favor of the killer, whether or not the decedent was then empowered to 38 
 
 Page 81 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 designate the decedent in place of the killer and whether or not the decedent then had 1 
capacity to exercise the power.  2 
2.  Forfeiture of statutory benefits.  An individual who feloniously and 3 
intentionally kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this Article with respect to the 4 
decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or 5 
child's share, a homestead allowance, exempt property and a family allowance.  If the 6 
decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed the 7 
killer's intestate share.  8 
3.  Revocation of benefits under governing instr uments.  The felonious and 9 
intentional killing of the decedent:  10 
A.  Revokes any revocable:  11 
(1)  Disposition or appointment of property made by the decedent to the killer in 12 
a governing instrument;  13 
(2)  Provision in a governing instrument conferring a gener al or nongeneral 14 
power of appointment on the killer; and  15 
(3)  Nomination of the killer in a governing instrument nominating or appointing 16 
the killer to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including as a 17 
personal representative, executor, tru stee or agent; and  18 
B.  Severs the interests of the decedent and killer in property held by them at the time 19 
of the killing as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests 20 
of the decedent and killer into equal tenancies in common . 21 
4.  Effect of severance.  A severance under subsection 3, paragraph B does not affect 22 
any 3rd -party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an 23 
apparent title by survivorship in the killer unless a writing declaring the sever ance has 24 
been noted, registered, filed or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of 25 
the property that are relied upon, in the ordinary course of transactions involving such 26 
property, as evidence of ownership.  27 
5.  Effect of revocation.  Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if 28 
the killer disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked 29 
nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the killer predeceased the 30 
decedent.  31 
6.  Wrongfu l acquisition of property.  A wrongful acquisition of property or 32 
interest by a killer not covered by this section must be treated in accordance with the 33 
principle that a killer may not profit from the killer's wrong.  34 
7.  Felonious and intentional killing;  how determined.  After all right to appeal has 35 
been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the 36 
felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted 37 
individual as the decedent's kill er for purposes of this section.  In the absence of a 38 
conviction, the court, upon the petition of an interested person, shall determine whether, 39 
under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual would be found criminally 40 
accountable for the felo nious and intentional killing of the decedent.  If the court 41 
 
 Page 82 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 determines that, under that standard, the individual would be found criminally 1 
accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent, the determination 2 
conclusively establishes th at individual as the decedent's killer for purposes of this 3 
section.  4 
8.  Protection of payors and other 3rd parties.  This subsection governs the 5 
liability of payors and other 3rd parties.  6 
A.  A payor or other 3rd party is not liable for having made a paym ent or transferred 7 
an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing 8 
instrument affected by an intentional and felonious killing or for having taken any 9 
other action if that payment, transfer or other action is made in goo d faith reliance on 10 
the validity of the governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the 11 
decedent's death, before the payor or other 3rd party received written notice of a 12 
claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.  A payor or oth er 3rd party is 13

pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by the payor or 21 
other 3rd party to or with the court having jurisdiction of the proba te proceedings 22 
relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or 23 
with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates 24 
located in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall h old the funds or 25 
item of property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order 26 
disbursement in accordance with the determination.  Payments, transfers or deposits 27

entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property or 39 
benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item 40 
of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.  41

by the divorced individual's remarriage to the former spouse or by a nullification of the 2 
divorce or annulment.  3 
6.  No revocation for other change of circumstances.  A ch ange of circumstances 4

§2-807.  Actions for wrongful death  21 
1.  Liability notwithstanding death.  Whenever the death of a pe rson is caused by a 22 
wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death 23 
had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages 24 
in respect thereof, then the person or the corporatio n that would have been liable if death 25 
had not ensued is liable for damages as provided in this section, notwithstanding the 26 
death of the person injured and although the death was caused under circumstances that 27 
amount to a felony.  28 
2.  Wrongful death actio n; damages; limitations.  Every wrongful death action 29 
must be brought by and in the name of the personal representative or special 30 
administrator of the deceased person, and is distributable, after payment for funeral 31 
expenses and the costs of recovery incl uding attorney's fees, directly to the decedent's 32 
heirs without becoming part of the probate estate, except as may be specifically provided 33 
in this subsection.  The amount recovered in every wrongful death action, except as 34 
specifically provided in this su bsection, is for the exclusive benefit of the deceased's heirs 35 
to be distributed to the individuals and in the proportions as provided in sections 2 -102 36 
and 2 -103.  The jury may give damages as it determines a fair and just compensation with 37 
reference to t he pecuniary injuries resulting from the death.  Damages are payable to the 38 
estate of the deceased person only if the jury specifically makes an award payable to the 39 
estate for reasonable expenses of medical, surgical and hospital care and treatment and 40 
for reasonable funeral expenses or, in the case of a settlement, the settlement documents 41 
specifically provide for such an allocation to the estate for the same.  In addition, the jury 42 
 
 Page 87 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 may give damages not exceeding $500,000 for the loss of comfort, society and 1 
companionship of the deceased, including any damages for emotional distress arising 2 
from the same facts as those constituting the underlying claim, to the persons for whose 3 
benefit the action is brought.  The jury may also give punitive damages not exc eeding 4 
$250,000.  An action under this section must be commenced within 2 years after the 5 
decedent's death, except that if the decedent's death is caused by a homicide, the action 6 
may be commenced within 6 years of the date the personal representative or s pecial 7

clear that a decedent may by will exclude or limit the right of an individual or class to 5 
succeed to property passing by intestate succession.  6

This section retains most of th e provisions of former Title 18 -A, section 2 -102 8 
regarding the share of the surviving spouse as a nonuniform provision.  This section 9 
decreases the surviving spouse’s share from the first $225,000, plus one -half of any 10 
balance of the intestate estate, if a ll of the decedent’s surviving descendants are also 11 
descendants of the surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has one or more surviving 12 
descendants who are not descendants of the decedent, to the first $100,000, plus one -half 13 
of the intestate estate.  14

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -202) 22 
The Uniform Probate Code  redefines the elective share and introduces the additional 23 
supplemental elective -share amount.  The additional supplemental elective -share amount 24 
in the Uniform Probate Code, section 2-202(b) is not adopted.  25 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Com ment (§2 -203) 26 
The Uniform Probate Code  defines the values to be considered in calculating the 27 
augmented estate with more clarity and specificity than former Title 18 -A.  The Uniform 28 
Probate Code  applies a partnership theory of marriage in calculating this marita l-property 29 
portion of the augmented estate , which prevents inequitable results by taking in to account 30 
the length of the marriage.   31 
 
 Page 97 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -204) 1 
This section  does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  2 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -205) 3 
The Maine Uniform Probate Code, section  2-205 changes Maine law in several 4 
respects.  Subsection  1 includes in the augmented estate any property of which the 5 
decedent could have become the owner through the exercise of  certain specific rights, 6 
regardless of who created those rights.  Under former Title 18 -A, such property would be 7 
included in the augmented estate only if the decedent's rights were retained in connection 8 
with a transfer of the property made by the decede nt during the marriage.  Subsection  1 9 
also closes a perceived loophole in the elective -share statute by including in the 10 
augmented estate proceeds of insurance on the life of the decedent that are payable to 11 
someone other than the surviving spouse.  It als o clarifies that individual retirement 12 
accounts and qualified retirement assets payable to persons other than the surviving 13 
spouse are included in the gross estate.   14 
Subsection  2 expands the assets that would be included in the augmented estate under 15 
prior law by including powers that are exercisable by a "nonadverse party." Prior law had 16 
included only powers exercisable by the decedent "either alone or in conjunction with any 17 
other person . . ."  18 
Subsection 3, paragraph C increases the amount that is excl uded from the augmented 19 
estate to the excess over 50% of the amount excludable from taxable gifts pursuant to 26 20 
United States Code, Section  2503(b).  The exclusion amount had been $3,000 under prior 21 
law.   22 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -207) 23 
The M aine Uniform Probate Code , section  2-207 modifies Maine law by including in 24 
the augmented estate all of the surviving spouse's property, regardless of whether it was 25 
derived from the decedent.  Former Title 18 -A included only property owned by the 26 
survivin g spouse at the decedent's death that was derived from the decedent  and property 27 
transferred by the surviving spouse during marriage that would have been included in the 28 
augmented estate had the surviving spouse predeceased the decedent.  The Maine 29 
Uniform  Probate Code , section  2-207 modifies this by including in the augmented estate 30 
any property that would have constituted the surviving spouse's nonprobate transfers to 31 
others applying the expanded rules under the Maine Uniform Probate Code , section  2-205 32 
had the surviving spouse been the decedent.   33 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -208) 34 
Although the Uniform Probate Code  provides that the value of property includes the 35 
commuted value of present or future interests and amounts payable under trusts and 36 
various contractual arrangements, it provides no guidance in terms of valuing beneficial 37 
interest in fully discretionary trusts for which commuted values are not readily 38 
 
 Page 98 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 determinable.  In adopting the Uniform Probate Code, section 2-208(b), Maine law  is 1 
modified to establish a rebuttable presumption that the value of a beneficial interest in a 2 
fully discretionary trust is 50% of the value of the trust assets.  This provision is similar to 3 
the presumption under former Title 18 -A, section  2-207, subsection (a)  with respect to the 4 
value of an electing spouse's beneficial interest in a life estate or trust.   5 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -212) 6 
This section revises former Title 18 -A, section 2 -203 in 3 significant respects.  First, 7 
it makes it clear that the right of election may be exercised only by or on behalf of a 8 
living surviving spouse.  Second, the election can be pursued on behalf of the surviving 9 
spouse by the spouse's conservator or agent.  In any case, the surviving spouse must be 10 
alive when the  election is made and cannot be pursued on behalf of a decedent.  Third, it 11 
treats incapacitated spouses the same as spouses with capacity.  Previously, if  a spouse 12 
was incapacitated, the court exercised the share on behalf of the incapacitated spouse only  13 
after a judicial proceeding to determine the necessity of the share for the incapacitated 14 
spouse's life expectancy ; a spouse with capacity was able to elect regardless of need.  15 
Treating incapacitated spouses the same as spouses with capacity is a deviatio n from 16 
the Uniform Probate Code (1990) , which provides that the incapacitated spouse's share is 17 
to be distributed to a custodial trust for the surviving spouse's life, the remainder 18 
beneficiaries of which are the predeceased spouse's residuary devisees or heirs.   19 
Eliminating the disparate treatment between incapacitated spouses and spouses with 20 
capacity is consistent with the revised elective -share law , which attempts to more closely 21 
align the amounts that a spouse receives upon divorce to that which the s pouse receives 22 
upon death.  Under this partnership theory of marriage, which forms the basis of much of 23 
the revisions to elective -share law, an incapacitated spouse in a divorce proceeding does 24 
not receive less of an equitable distribution solely due to th e incapacity.  This section 25 
therefore applies the partnership theory of marriage equitably to all surviving spouses.  26

exempt property entitlement, in lieu of referencing Title 14, section 4421 et seq. The 9 
section has been modified to permit the decedent, by will, to exclude one or more adult 10 
children from the receipt of exempt property.  11

This section  does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  13 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -405) 14 
Maine’s adoption of section 2 -405 represents a deviation from the Unifor m Probate 15 
Code  by eliminating the discretion of the personal representative to add any unexpended 16 
portions payable under the homestead allow ance, exempt property  and family allowance 17 
to a custodial trust established under the Uniform Probate Code, section 2-212(b).  Maine 18 
has chosen not to treat an incapacitated surviving spouse different ly from a surviving 19 
spouse with capacity for purposes of the elective share and therefore has not adopted 20 
section 2 -212(b) of the Uniform Probate Code .  See Maine Uniform P robate Code 21 
Comment  section 2 -212.  This same concept is applied in this section to amounts payable 22 
under the homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance, with no 23 
distinction made between a surviving incapacitated spouse and a surviving spous e with 24 
capacity.    25 
This section increases the family allowance to a lump sum not exceeding $2 7,000 26 
from the previous $12,000  and increases periodic installments to an amount not 27 
exceeding $2,250 per month from the previous $1,000.  The family allowance is  subject 28 
to cost -of-living adjustments as provided in section 1 -109. 29 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -501) 30 
This section has been modified to make it clear that a legally emancipated minor 31 
under  18 years of age may make a will.  32

 This section does not adopt the Uniform Probate Code ’s alternative method of will 1 
execution of acknowledgement by a notary in lieu of execution by 2 witnesses.  The 2 
section adopts the “conscious presence” test of the Uniform Probate Co de.  Under the 3 
“conscious presence” test, a signing is sufficient if it was done within the range of the 4 
testator’s senses , such as within the testator’s hearing; the signing need not have occurred 5 
within the testator’s line of sight.  6 
The Maine Supreme Jud icial Court held in In Re Estate of Gonzalez , 855 A.2d 1146 7 
2004 ME 109 (Me.  2004) that a pre printed form filled in with the testator’s handwriting 8 
can qualify as a holographic will.  9 
The section departs from the Uniform Probate Code  by not referencing the  harmless 10 
error standard of the Uniform Probate Code , which is not adopted in Maine.  11 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -503) 12 
This section modifies former Title 18 -A, section 2 -504 in 3 respects: it adds 13 
references where appropriate to a legally emancip ated minor, adds male  and female 14 
gender options where appropriate to update the single male pronoun and deletes 15 
references to a notary seal as unnecessary.   16 
The section includes as  subsection 3  a new provision  from the Uniform Probate Code  17 
to make clear t hat it is not n ecessary for a testator  who is simultaneously self -proving the 18 
testator’s will to sign the will twice, once on the will itself  and again on the self -proving 19 
provisions.  A s ingle signature by the testator on the self -proving provisions  is sufficient.  20

The new language of this section reflects the broad theme of the latest  Uniform 4

construction.  7 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§2 -602) 8 
 The removal of the second sentence " A devise of property conveys all the estate of a 9 
devisor unless it appears by his will that he intended to convey a lesser estate. " from former 10 
Title 18 -A, section 2 -604 is not intended to create an inference that Maine is changing a long - 11 
standing presumption that a devise passes the testator 's full interest in the property.  12 
Maine U niform Probate Code Comment (§2 -603) 13 
 The phrase "by representation " in the Uniform Probate Code  has been changed to 14 
"per capita at each generation " in Title 18 -C.  The phrase "by representation " is synonymous 15 
with "per stirpes ."  See the Maine Uniform Pro bate Code, section 2 -709. Maine has long 16 
considered inheritance by right of representation to be synonymous with inheritance per 17 
stirpes.   Fiduciary Trust Co. v. Brown,  131 A.2d 191 (Me. 1957).  18 
 Maine has reversed the presumption of section 2 -603(b)(3) of  the Uniform Probate 19 
Code , which created a rebuttable presumption that using words of survivorship, such as a 20 
devise to an individual "if he survives me " or in a devise to "my surviving children, " are not, 21 
in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficien t indication of an intent contrary to the 22 
application  of the anti -lapse provisions.  Under the Maine Uniform Probate Code,  words of 23 
survivorship create a rebuttable presumption of the testator 's intent to not have the anti -lapse 24 
provisions apply.  For exam ple, in a devise to "my surviving children, " if the testator had 25 
three children, X, Y and Z, and child X predeceased the testator leaving GC1 and GC2, the 26 
devise will be distributed in equal shares to Y and Z, with no distribution to GC1 and GC2.  27

2-607 governs the substantive rights of the devisee. The common law rule of exoneration of 9

 If the document creating a power of appointment does not require a specific reference 13 
to the power in order for it to be exercised, the general rule remains unchanged in stating that 14 
a general residuary clause is not effective to  exercise the power unless the testator 's will 15 
manifests an intention to have the residuary clause include the property subject to the power.  16 
This section adds one circumstance where a residuary clause is presumed to include the 17

 The phrase "by representation " in the Uniform Probate Code  has been changed to 4 
"per capita at each generation " in Title 18 -C.  The phrase "by representation " is synonymous 5 
with "per stirpes ."  See the Maine Un iform Probate Code, section 2 -709. Maine has long 6

 Maine has reversed the presumption of section 2 -706(b)(3) of the Uniform Probate 9 
Code  (Maine Uniform Probate Code, section 2 -706, subsection 2, paragraph C), which 10 
created a rebuttable presumption that using words of survivorship, such as a beneficiary 11 
designation to an individual "if he survives me " or in a  beneficiary designation to "my 12 
surviving children, " are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of 13 
an intent contrary to the application of the anti -lapse provisions.   Under the Maine Uniform 14 
Probate Code,  words of survivorshi p create a rebuttable presumption of the testator 's intent to 15 
not have the anti -lapse provisions apply.  For example, in a devise to "my surviving children, " 16 
if the testator had three children, X, Y and Z, and child X predeceased the testator leaving 17

PROBATE OF WILLS AND  ADMINISTRATION  19 
PART 1  20 
GENERAL PROVISIONS  21 
§3-101.  Devolution of estate at death; restrictions  22 
The power of a person to leave property by will and the rights of creditors, devisees 23 
and heirs to the person's property are subject to the restrictions and limitat ions contained 24 
in this Code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates.  Upon the death of a person, the 25 
 
 Page 108 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 person's real and personal property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by the 1 
person's last will or to those indicated as substitutes fo r them in cases involving lapse, 2 
renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estate or, in the 3 
absence of testamentary disposition, to the person's heirs, or to those indicated as 4 
substitutes for them in cases involving renuncia tion or other circumstances affecting 5 
devolution of intestate estates, subject to homestead allowance, exempt property and 6 
family allowance, to rights of creditors, to elective share of the surviving spouse and to 7 
administration.  8 
§3-102.  Necessity of orde r of probate for will  9 
Except as provided in section 3 -1201, to be effective to prove the transfer of any 10 
property or to nominate an executor, a will must be declared to be valid by an order of 11 
informal probate by the registers or an adjudication of probate  by the court.  12 
§3-103.  Necessity of appointment for administration  13 
Except as otherwise provided in Article 4, to acquire the powers and undertake the 14 
duties and liabilities of a personal representative of a decedent, a person must be 15 
appointed by order of  the court or registers, qualify and be issued letters. Administration 16 
of an estate is commenced by the issuance of letters.  17 
§3-104.  Claims against decedent; necessity of administration  18 
A proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or t he decedent's 19 
successors may not be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal 20 
representative.  After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions 21 
to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure pre scribed by this 22 
Article.  After distribution, a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from 23 
the distributees as provided in section 3 -1004 or from a former personal representative 24 
individually liable as provided in section 3 -1005.  This secti on has no application to a 25 
proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce the creditor's right to the 26 
security except as to any deficiency judgment that might be sought.  27 
§3-105.  Proceedings affecting devolution and administration; jurisdictio n of subject 28 
matter  29 
Persons interested in decedents' estates may apply to the register for determination in 30 
the informal proceedings provided in this Article and may petition the court for orders in 31 
formal proceedings within the court's jurisdiction includ ing but not limited to those 32 
described in this Article.  The court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to 33 
determine how decedents' estates subject to the laws of this State are to be administered, 34 
expended and distributed.  The court has concu rrent jurisdiction of any other action or 35 
proceeding concerning a succession or to which an estate, through a personal 36 
representative, may be a party, including actions to determine title to property alleged to 37 
belong to the estate, and of any action or pr oceeding in which property is distributed by a 38 
personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or 39 
successors of the decedent.  40

 §3-106.  Proceedings within the jurisdiction of court; service; jurisdiction over 1 
persons  2 
In proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court where notice is required 3 
by this Code or by rule, and in proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs 4 
that concern estates that have not been and cannot now be opened for administrati on, 5 
interested persons may be bound by the orders of the court in respect to property in or 6 
subject to the laws of this State by notice in conformity with section 1 -401.  An order is 7 
binding on all who are given notice of the proceeding though fewer than a ll interested 8 
persons are notified.  9 
§3-107.  Scope of proceedings; proceedings independent; exception  10 
Unless supervised administration as described in Part 5 is involved:  11 
1.  Proceedings independent.  Each proceeding before the court or register is 12 
indepen dent of any other proceeding involving the same estate;  13 
2.  Petitions for formal orders.  Petitions for formal orders of the court may 14 
combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be 15 
finally granted without delay. Exc ept as required for proceedings that are particularly 16 
described by other sections of this Article, a petition is not defective because it fails to 17 
embrace all matters that might then be the subject of a final order;  18 
3.  Petitions for appointment of persona l representative.  Proceedings for probate 19 
of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of 20 
personal representatives; and  21 
4.  Order.  A proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded 22 
by an order  making or declining the appointment.  23 
§3-108.  Probate, testacy and appointment proceedings; ultimate time limit  24 
1.  Limitations period; exceptions.  An informal probate or appointment proceeding 25 
or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a pr oceeding to probate a will 26 
previously probated at the testator's domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an 27 
estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may not be commenced more than 3 28 
years after the decedent's death, except:  29 
A.  If a pre vious proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the 30 
decedent's death, appropriate probate, appointment or testacy proceedings may be 31 
maintained at any time thereafter upon a finding that the decedent's death occurred 32 
prior to the initiati on of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has 33 
not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceeding;  34 
B.  Appropriate probate, appointment or testacy proceedings may be maintained in 35 
relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared or missing person for whose estate a 36 
conservator has been appointed at any time within 3 years after the conservator 37 
becomes able to establish the death of the protected person;  38 
 
 Page 110 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 C.  A proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointm ent of 1 
the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful 2 
may be commenced within the later of 12 months from the informal probate or 3 3 
years from the decedent's death;  4 
D.  An informal appointment or a formal testacy or a ppointment proceeding may be 5 
commenced more than 3 years after the decedent's death if no proceeding concerning 6 
the succession or estate administration has occurred within the 3 -year period after the 7 
decedent's death, but the personal representative has no  right to possess estate assets 8 
as provided in section 3 -709 beyond that necessary to confirm title in the successors 9 
to the estate, and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented 10 
against the estate; and  11 
E.  A formal testacy proceedi ng may be commenced at any time after 3 years from 12 
the decedent's death for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control 13 
the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent's death from a 14 
person other than the decedent w hen the property is to be appointed by the terms of 15 
the decedent's will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent's estate or 16 
its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent's will.  17 
2.  Limitations period inapplicabl e.  The limitations under subsection 1 do not 18 
apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate.  19 
3.  Special provision regarding date of death.  In cases under subsection 1, 20 
paragraph A or B, the date on which a testacy or appointment proceeding is properly 21 
commenced is deemed to be the date of the decedent's death for purposes of other 22 
limitations provisions of this Code that relate to the date of death.  23 
§3-109.  Statutes of limitation on decedent's cause of action  24 
A statut e of limitation running on a cause of action belonging to a decedent that had 25 
not been barred as of the date of death does not apply to bar a cause of action surviving 26 
the decedent's death sooner than 4 months after death. A cause of action that but for th is 27 
section would have been barred less than 4 months after death is barred after 4 months 28 
unless tolled.  29 
§3-110.  Discovery of property  30 
1.  Examination by court.  Upon petition by a county attorney, personal 31 
representative, heir, devisee, creditor or other  person interested in the estate of a 32 
decedent, anyone suspected of having concealed, withheld or conveyed away any 33 
property of the decedent, of having fraudulently received any such property, or of aiding 34 
others in so doing, may be cited by the court to a ppear and be examined under oath.  The 35 
court may require the person to produce for the inspection of the court and parties all 36 
documents within the person's control relating to the matter under examination.  The time 37 
for filing such petitions is governed b y section 1 -105. 38 
2.  Penalties for refusal.  If a person duly cited pursuant to subsection 1 refuses to 39 
appear and submit to the court's examination, to answer all lawful interrogatories or to 40 
produce the documents ordered, the person is subject to contemp t of the court and is 41 
 
 Page 111 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 liable to any injured party in a civil action for all the damages, expenses and charges 1 
arising from such refusal.  2 
PART 2  3 
VENUE FOR PROBATE AN D ADMINISTRATION, PR IORITY TO 4 
ADMINISTER AND DEMAN D FOR NOTICE  5 
§3-201.  Venue for first and subsequent estate proceedings; location of property  6 
1.  Venue for first estate proceedings.  Venue for the first informal or formal testacy 7 
or appointment proceedings after a decedent's death is:  8 
A.  In the county where the decedent was domiciled at the ti me of death; or  9 
B.  If the decedent was not domiciled in this State, in any county where property of 10 
the decedent was located at the time of the decedent's death.  11 
2.  Venue for subsequent proceedings.  Venue for all subsequent proceedings 12 
within the exclus ive jurisdiction of the court is in the place where the initial proceeding 13 
occurred, unless the initial proceeding has been transferred as provided in subsection 3 or 14 
section 1 -303. 15 
3.  Transfer after informal proceeding.  If the first proceeding was infor mal, on 16 
application of an interested person and after notice to the proponent in the first 17 
proceeding, the court, upon finding that venue is elsewhere, may transfer the proceeding 18 
and the file to the other court.  19 
4.  Location of property.  For the purpose of aiding determinations concerning 20 
location of property that may be relevant in cases involving non -domiciliaries, a debt, 21 
other than one evidenced by investment or commercial paper or other instrument in favor 22 
of a non -domiciliary, is located where the d ebtor resides or, if the debtor is a person other 23 
than an individual, at the place where it has its principal office. Commercial paper, 24 
investment paper and other instruments are located where the instrument is. An interest in 25 
property held in trust is loc ated where the trustee may be sued.  26 
§3-202.  Appointment or testacy proceedings; conflicting claim of domicile in 27 
another state  28 
If conflicting claims as to the domicile of a decedent are made in a formal testacy or 29 
appointment proceeding commenced in this State, and in a testacy or appointment 30 
proceeding after notice pending at the same time in another state, the court of this State 31 
must stay, dismiss or permit suitable amendment in the proceeding in this State unless it 32 
is determined that the proceeding in  this State was commenced before the proceeding 33 
elsewhere. The determination of domicile in the proceeding first commenced must be 34 
accepted as determinative in the proceeding in this State.  35 
§3-203.  Priority among persons seeking appointment as personal re presentative  36 
1.  Priority.  Whether the proceedings are formal or informal, persons who are not 37 
disqualified have priority for appointment in the following order:  38 
 
 Page 112 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 A.  The person with priority as determined by a probated will including a person 1 
nominated by  a power conferred in a will;  2 
B.  The surviving spouse of the decedent who is a devisee of the decedent;  3 
C.  Other devisees of the decedent;  4 
D.  The surviving spouse of the decedent;  5 
E.  The surviving domestic partner of the decedent;  6 
F.  Other heirs of th e decedent;  7 
G.  Forty -five days after the death of the decedent, any creditor; and  8 
H.  Six months after the death of the decedent if no testacy proceeding have been held 9 
or no personal representative has been appointed, the State Tax Assessor upon 10 
applicat ion by the State Tax Assessor.  11 
2.  Objection.  An objection to an appointment may be made only in formal 12 
proceedings.  In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection 1 apply except that:  13 
A.  If the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of 14 
administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on 15 
petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person; or  16 
B.  In case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is 17 
determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the 18 
estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose 19 
interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than 1/2 of the probable 20 
distributable value or, in default of this accord, any suitable person.  21 
3.  Nomination and renunciation.  A person entitled to letters under subsection 1, 22 
paragraphs B to F may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative.  Any 23 
person may renounce the person's right to nominate or to an appointment by appropriate 24 
writing filed with the court. When 2 or more persons share a priority, those of them who 25 
do not renounce must concur in nominating another to act for them or in applying for 26 
appoin tment.  27 
4.  Authority of conservators and guardians.  Conservators of the estates of 28 
protected persons or, if there is no conservator, any guardian except a guardian ad litem 29 
of a minor or incapacitated person, or an agent under a power of attorney that exp ressly 30 
grants the agent the authority to do so, may exercise the same right to nominate, to object 31 
to another's appointment or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in 32 
interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or war d would have if qualified 33 
for appointment.  34 
5.  Appointment without priority.  Appointment of a person who does not have 35 
priority, including priority resulting from renunciation or nomination determined pursuant 36 
to this section, may be made only in formal p roceedings.  Before appointing a person 37 
without priority, the court must determine that those persons having priority, although 38 
given notice of the proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate 39 
another person for appointment and that admin istration is necessary.  40 
 
 Page 113 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 6.  Qualifications.  A person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who:  1 
A.  Is 18 years of age or older; and  2 
B.  Has not been found unsuitable by the court in formal proceedings.  3 
7.  Priority of personal representative  appointed by domiciliary court.  A 4 
personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent's domicile has priority over 5 
all other persons except when the decedent's will nominates different persons to be 6 
personal representative in this State and in t he state of domicile. The domiciliary personal 7 
representative may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the domiciliary 8 
personal representative.  9 
8.  Applicability.  This section governs priority for appointment of a successor 10 
personal repre sentative but does not apply to the selection of a special administrator.  11 
§3-204.  Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent's estate  12 
A person desiring notice of an order or filing pertaining to a decedent's estate in 13 
which the person has a financial or property interest may file a demand for notice with the 14 
court at any time after the death of the decedent, stating the name of the decedent, the 15 
nature of the demandant's interest in the estate and the demandant's address or that of the 16 
demand ant's attorney.  The register shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal 17 
representative, if one has been appointed.  After filing of a demand, an order or filing to 18 
which the demand relates may not be made or accepted without notice as prescribed in 19 
section 1 -401 to the demandant or the demandant's attorney.  The validity of an order that 20 
is issued or filing that is accepted without compliance with this requirement is not 21 
affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person makin g the filing 22 
is liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice.  The requirement of notice 23 
arising from demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant 24 
and ceases upon the termination of the demandant's interest in the estate.  25

circumstances as described by section 3 -108 have occurred authorizing tardy 16 
probate or appointment;  17

§3-302.  Informal probate; duty of register; effect of informal probate  17 
Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the register upon 18 
making the findings  required by section 3 -303 shall issue a written statement of informal 19 
probate if at least 120 hours have elapsed since the decedent's death.  Informal probate is 20 
conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.  21 
No defect in the application or procedure that leads to informal probate of a will renders 22 
the probate void.  23 
§3-303.  Informal probate; proof and findings required  24 
1.  Informal probate; proof and findings required.  In an informal proceeding for 25 
original pro bate of a will, the register shall determine whether:  26 
A.  The application is complete;  27 
B.  The applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the 28 
application are true to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief;  29 
C.  The app licant appears from the application to be an interested person as defined in 30 
section 1 -201, subsection 26;  31 
D.  On the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;  32 
E.  An original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the regist er's 33 
possession;  34 
F.  Any notice required by section 3 -204 has been given and the application is not 35 
required to be declined under section 3 -304; and  36 
G.  It appears from the application that the time limit for original probate has not 37 
expired.  38 
 
 Page 116 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 2.  Denial.  The application must be denied if it indicates that a personal 1 
representative has been appointed in another county of this State or, except as provided in 2 
subsection 4, if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of 3 
a previ ous probate order.  4 
3.  Executed will.  A will that appears to have the required signatures and that 5 
contains an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under section 2 -502 6 
or 2-505 have been met must be probated without further proof.  In  other cases, the 7 
register may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed or the 8 
register may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of any person having knowledge of the 9 
circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a w itness to the will.  10 
4.  Will previously probated elsewhere.  Informal probate of a will that has been 11 
previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by 12 
any interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy  of the will and of 13 
the statement probating it from the office of court where it was first probated.  14

probate of a will after death and that is not eligible for probate under sub section 1 may be 16 
probated in this State upon receipt by the register of a duly authenticated copy of the will 17 
and a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy filed is a true copy 18 
and that the will has become operative under the la w of that place.  19 
§3-304.  Informal probate; unavailable in certain cases  20 
Applications for informal probate that relate to one or more of a known series of 21 
testamentary instruments, the latest of which does not expressly revoke the earlier, other 22 
than a wil l and one or more codicils thereto, must be declined.  23 
§3-305.  Informal probate; register not satisfied  24 
If the register is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal 25 
proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 3-303 and 3 -304 or 26 
any other reason, the register may decline the application.  A declination of informal 27 
probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings.  28 
§3-306.  Informal probate; notice requirements  29 
The moving party shall  give notice as described by section 1 -401 of the moving 30 
party's application for informal probate to any person demanding notice pursuant to 31 
section 3 -204 and to any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has 32 
not been terminated.  If the  decedent was 55 years of age or older, the moving party shall 33 
give notice as described in section 1 -401 to the Department of Health and Human 34 
Services.  Except as provided in section 3 -705, no other notice of informal probate is 35 
required.  36

of appointment  2 
1.  Duty to appoint; delay in order.  Upon receipt of an application for informal 3 
appointment of a personal representative, other than a special administrator as provided in  4 
section 3 -614, if at least 120 hours have elapsed since the decedent's death, the register, 5 
after making the findings required by section 3 -308, shall appoint the applicant subject to 6 
qualification and acceptance.  If the decedent was a nonresident, the r egister shall delay 7 
the order of appointment until 30 days have elapsed since death unless the personal 8 
representative appointed at the decedent's domicile is the applicant or unless the 9 
decedent's will directs that the decedent's estate be subject to the laws of this State.  10 
2.  Effect of appointment.  The status of personal representative and the powers and 11 
duties pertaining to the office are fully established by informal appointment.  An 12 
appointment, and the office of personal representative it creates, i s subject to termination 13 
as provided in sections 3 -608 to 3 -612 but is not subject to retroactive vacation.  14 
§3-308.  Informal appointment proceedings; proof and findings required  15

E.  Any wil l to which the requested appointment relates has been formally or 25 
informally probated, but this requirement does not apply to the appointment of a 26 
special administrator;  27 
F.  Any notice required by section 3 -204 has been given; and  28 
G.  From the statements i n the application, the person whose appointment is sought 29 
has priority entitling the applicant to the appointment.  30 
2.  Denial.  Unless section 3 -612 controls, the application must be denied if it 31 
indicates that a personal representative who has not filed a  written statement of 32 
resignation as provided in section 3 -610, subsection 3 has been appointed in this or 33 
another county of this State; that, unless the applicant is the domiciliary personal 34 
representative or the nominee, the decedent was not domiciled in  this State and that a 35 
personal representative whose appointment has not been terminated has been appointed 36 
by a court in the state of domicile; or that other requirements of this section have not been 37

 Page 118 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-309.  Informal appointment proceedings; regist er not satisfied  1 
If the register is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal 2 
representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 3 
3-307 and 3 -308, or for any other reason, the register may decline t he application.  A 4 
declination of informal appointment is not an adjudication and does not preclude 5 
appointment in formal proceedings.  6 
§3-310.  Informal appointment proceedings; notice requirements  7 
The moving party shall give notice as described by section  1-401 of the moving 8 
party's intention to seek an appointment informally to any person demanding notice 9

older, the moving party shall give notice as described in section 1 -401 to the Department 12 
of Health and Human Services.  No other notice of an informal appointment proceeding 13 
is required.  14 
§3-311.  Informal appointment unavailable i n certain cases  15 
If an application for informal appointment indicates the existence of a possible 16 
unrevoked testamentary instrument that may relate to property subject to the laws of this 17 
State and that is not filed for probate in the court, the register mu st decline the 18 
application.  19 
PART 4  20 
FORMAL TESTACY AND A PPOINTMENT PROCEEDIN GS 21 
§3-401.  Formal testacy proceedings; nature; when commenced  22 
A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid 23 
will.  A formal testacy proceed ing may be commenced by an interested person filing a 24 
petition as described in section 3 -402, subsection 1 in which the petitioner requests that 25 
the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set 26 
aside an informal pr obate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will that is the 27 
subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with section 3 -402, 28 
subsection 2 for an order that the decedent died intestate.  29 
A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a 30 
conflicting will has been informally probated.  A formal testacy proceeding may, but 31 
need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.  32 
During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the r egister may not act upon 33 
any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for 34 
informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.  35 
Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the 36 
previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after 37 
receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from 38 
 
 Page 119 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 making any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the for mal 1 
proceeding.  A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal 2 
representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting 3 
personal representative from exercising any of the powers of the office and requesting th e 4 
appointment of a special administrator.  In the absence of a request, or if the request is 5 
denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties 6 
of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.  7 
§3-402.  Formal testacy or appointment proceedings; petition; contents  8 
1.  Petition for formal probate of a will; contents.  Petitions for formal probate of a 9 
will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or without request for appointment o f a personal 10 
representative, must be directed to the court, request a judicial order after notice and 11 
hearing, contain further statements as indicated in this section and contain such other 12 
information and be in such form as the Supreme Judicial Court may by rule provide.  A 13 
petition for formal probate of a will must:  14 
A.  Request an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular 15 
instrument that may or may not have been informally probated and determining the 16 
heirs;  17 
B.  Contain the state ments required for informal applications as stated in section 18 
3-301, subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraphs (1) to (4) and the statements 19 
required by section 3 -301, subsection 1, paragraph B, subparagraphs (2) and (3); and  20 
C.  State whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of 21 
the court or accompanies the petition.  22 
If the original will is neither in the possession of the court nor accompanies the petition 23 
and no authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction  accompanies the 24 
petition, the petition also must state the contents of the will and indicate that it is lost, 25 
destroyed or otherwise unavailable.  26 
2.  Relief requested.  A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an 27 
administrator in intest acy must request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left 28 
no will and determining the heirs, contain the statements required by section 3 -301, 29 
subsection 1, paragraphs A and D, indicate whether supervised administration is sought 30 
and contain suc h other information and be in such form as the Supreme Judicial Court 31 
may by rule provide.  A petition may request an order determining intestacy and heirs 32 
without requesting the appointment of an administrator, in which case the statements 33 
required by sec tion 3 -301, subsection 1, paragraph D, subparagraph (2) may be omitted.  34 
§3-403.  Formal testacy proceeding; notice of hearing on petition  35 
1.  Notice of hearing on petition for formal probate of a will.  Upon 36 
commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the  court shall fix a time and place of 37 
hearing.  Notice must be given in the manner prescribed by section 1 -401 by the 38 
petitioner to the persons enumerated in this subsection and to any additional person who 39 
has filed a demand for notice under section 3 -204. 40 
 
 Page 120 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 Notice must be given to the following persons: the surviving spouse, children and other 1 
heirs of the decedent, the devisees and executors named in any will that is being, or has 2 
been, probated or offered for informal or formal probate in the county or tha t is known by 3 
the petitioner to have been probated or offered for informal or formal probate elsewhere 4 
and any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been 5 
terminated.  If the decedent was 55 years of age or older, the petitioner shall give notice 6 
as described in section 1 -401 to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Notice 7 
may be given to other persons.  In addition, the petitioner shall give notice by publication 8 
to all unknown persons and to all known persons whose addre sses are unknown who have 9 
any interest in the matters being litigated.  10 
2.  Additional notice when death in doubt.  If it appears by the petition or otherwise 11 
that the fact of the death of the alleged decedent may be in doubt, or on the written 12 
demand of an y interested person, a copy of the notice of the hearing on the petition must 13 
be sent by registered mail to the alleged decedent at the alleged decedent's last known 14 
address.  The court shall direct the petitioner to report the results of, or make and repo rt 15 
back concerning, a reasonably diligent search for the alleged decedent in any manner that 16 
may seem advisable, including any of the following methods:  17 
A.  By inserting in one or more suitable periodicals a notice requesting information 18 
from any person ha ving knowledge of the whereabouts of the alleged decedent;  19 
B.  By notifying law enforcement officials and public welfare agencies in appropriate 20 
locations of the disappearance of the alleged decedent; and  21 
C.  By engaging the services of an investigator.  T he costs of any search directed by 22 
the court must be paid by the petitioner if there is no administration or by the estate of 23 
the decedent if there is administration.  24 
§3-404.  Formal testacy proceedings; written objections to probate  25 
Any party to a formal proceeding who opposes the probate of a will for any reason 26 
shall state in that party's pleadings that party's objections to probate of the will.  27 
§3-405.  Formal testacy proceedings; uncontested cases; hearings and proof  28 
If a petition in a testacy proceedi ng is unopposed, the court may order probate or 29 
intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 3 -409 30 
have been met or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters 31 
necessary to support the order so ught.  If evidence concerning execution of the will is 32 
necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is 33 
sufficient.  If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution 34 
of the will m ay be proved by other evidence or affidavit.  35 
§3-406.  Formal testacy proceedings; contested cases  36 
In a contested case in which the proper execution of a will is at issue:  37 
1.  Self-proved will; witness not required.  If the will is self -proved pursuant to 38 
section 2 -503, the will satisfies the requirements for execution without the testimony of 39 
any attesting witness upon the filing of the will and the acknowledgment and affidavits 40 
 
 Page 121 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 annexed or attached to it, unless there is evidence of fraud or forgery affecti ng the 1 
acknowledgment or affidavit; or  2 
2.  Will not notarized; attesting witness required.  If the will is witnessed pursuant 3 
to section 2 -502, subsection 1, paragraph C but not notarized or self -proved, the 4 
testimony of at least one of the attesting witne sses is required to establish proper 5 
execution if the witness is within this State, competent and able to testify.  Proper 6 
execution may be established by other evidence, including an affidavit of an attesting 7 
witness.  An attestation clause that is signed  by the attesting witnesses raises a rebuttable 8 
presumption that the events recited in the clause occurred.  9 
§3-407.  Formal testacy proceedings; burdens in contested cases  10 
In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of 11 
establishing prima facie proof of death, venue and heirship.  Proponents of a will have the 12 
burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and, if they are also 13 
petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue.  Contestants of a wil l have the burden 14 
of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, 15 
mistake or revocation.  Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with 16 
respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.  If  a will is opposed by the petition 17 
for probate of a later will revoking the former, it must be determined first whether the 18 
later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of 19 
intestacy, it must be determined firs t whether the will is entitled to probate.  20 
§3-408.  Formal testacy proceedings; will construction; effect of final order in 21 
another jurisdiction  22 
A final order of a court of another state determining testacy or the validity or 23 
construction of a will made in  a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for 24 
contest by all interested persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this 25 
State if it includes or is based upon a finding that the decedent at death was domiciled in 26 
the state where t he order was made.  27 
§3-409.  Formal testacy proceedings; order; foreign will  28 
After the time required for any notice has expired, upon proof of notice, and after any 29 
hearing that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, venue is proper  30 
and that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed by section 31 
3-108, the court shall determine the decedent's domicile at death, heirs and state of 32 
testacy.  Any will found to be valid and unrevoked must be formally probated.  33 
Terminat ion of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which 34 
may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by section 35 
3-612.  The petition must be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is 36 
not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead.  A will from a foreign jurisdiction, 37 
including a place that does not provide for probate of a will after death, may be proved 38 
for probate in this State by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian  that the 39 
copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the 40 
other place.  41 
 
 Page 122 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-410.  Formal testacy proceedings; probate of more than one instrument  1 
If 2 or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order  is entered in a 2 
formal testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly 3 
revokes the other or contains provisions that work a total revocation by implication.  If 4 
more than one instrument is probated, the order must indicat e what provisions control in 5 
respect to the nomination of an executor, if any.  The order may, but need not, indicate 6 
how any provisions of a particular instrument are affected by the other instrument.  After 7 
a final order in a testacy proceeding has been entered, no petition for probate of any other 8 
instrument of the decedent may be entertained, except incident to a petition to vacate or 9 
modify a previous probate order and subject to the time limits of section 3 -412. 10 
§3-411.  Formal testacy proceedings; pa rtial intestacy  11 
If it becomes evident in the course of a formal testacy proceeding that, though one or 12 
more instruments are entitled to be probated, the decedent's estate is or may be partially 13 
intestate, the court shall enter an order to that effect.  14 
§3-412.  Formal testacy proceedings; effect of order; vacation  15 
Subject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided in this section and in section 16 
3-413, a formal testacy order under sections 3 -409 to 3 -411, including an order that the 17 
decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, is final as to all persons with respect to 18 
all issues concerning the decedent's estate that the court considered or might have 19 
considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a 20 
valid wi ll and to the determination of heirs, except that:  21 
1.  Petition to modify or vacate formal testacy order.  The court shall entertain a 22 
petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the 23 
decedent if it is shown that the pr oponents of the later -offered will:  24 
A.  Were unaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding; or  25 
B.  Were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice thereof, except 26 
by publication;  27 
2.  Reconsideration of order determining hei rs.  If intestacy of all or part of the 28 
estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of the decedent may be reconsidered if 29 
it is shown that one or more persons were omitted from the determination and it is also 30 
shown that the persons were unaware o f their relationship to the decedent, were unaware 31 
of the decedent's death or were given no notice of any proceeding concerning the 32 
decedent's estate, except by publication;  33 
3.  Time limits.  A petition for vacation under either subsection 1 or 2 must be f iled 34 
prior to the earlier of the following time limits:  35 
A.  If a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of 36 
any order approving final distribution of the estate or, if the estate is closed by 37 
statement, 6 months after the filing of the closing statement;  38 
 
 Page 123 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 B.  Whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the 1 
decedent, the time prescribed by section 3 -108 when it is no longer possible to initiate 2 
an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent; or  3 
C.  Twelve months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated;  4 
4.  Modification or vacation order.  The order originally rendered in the testacy 5 
proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances, by the 6 
order of probate of the later -offered will or the order redetermining heirs; and  7 
5.  Effect of finding of fact of death.  The finding of the fact of death is conclusive 8 
as to the alleged decedent only if notice of the hearing on the petition in the formal 9 
testacy proceeding was sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the alleged 10 
decedent at the decedent's last known address and the court finds that a search under 11 
section 3 -403, subsection 2 was made.  12 
If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if noti ce was sent and search was made, the 13 
alleged decedent may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative.  In 14 
addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or 15 
intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decede nt may recover any estate or its proceeds from 16 
distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the 17 
extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.  18 
§3-413.  Formal testacy proceedings; vacation of order for other cause  19 
For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may be modified or 20 
vacated within the time allowed for appeal.  21 
§3-414.  Formal proceedings concerning appointment of personal representative  22 
1.  Formal proceeding for appointment of personal representative.  A formal 23 
proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or qualification of a person who is an 24 
applicant for appointment as personal representative, or of a person who previously has 25 
been app ointed personal representative in informal proceedings, if an issue concerning 26 
the testacy of the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by section 3 -402 as well as 27 
by this section.  In other cases, the petition must contain or adopt the statements re quired 28 
by section 3 -301, subsection 1, paragraph A and describe the question relating to priority 29 
or qualification of the personal representative that is to be resolved.  If the proceeding 30 
precedes any appointment of a personal representative, it shall sta y any pending informal 31 
appointment proceedings as well as any commenced thereafter.  If the proceeding is 32 
commenced after appointment, the previously appointed personal representative, after 33 
receipt of notice, shall refrain from exercising any power of adm inistration except as 34 
necessary to preserve the estate or unless the court orders otherwise.  35 
2.  Notice and decision.  After notice to interested persons, including all persons 36 
interested in the administration of the estate as successors under the applicab le 37 
assumption concerning testacy, any previously appointed personal representative and any 38 
person having or claiming priority for appointment as personal representative, the court 39 
shall determine who is entitled to appointment under section 3 -203, make a p roper 40 
 
 Page 124 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 appointment and, if appropriate, terminate any prior appointment found to have been 1 
improper as provided in cases of removal under section 3 -611. 2 
PART 5  3 
SUPERVISED ADMINISTR ATION  4 
§3-501.  Supervised administration; nature of proceeding  5 
Supervised adm inistration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete 6 
administration and settlement of a decedent's estate under the continuing authority of the 7 
court that extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and 8 
discharging the pers onal representative or other order terminating the proceeding.  A 9 
supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested 10 
parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own 11 
motion o r on the motion of any interested party.  Except as otherwise provided in this 12 
Part, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the 13 
same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.  14 
§3-502.  Supe rvised administration; petition; order  15 
A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a 16 
personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be 17 
joined with a petition in a testacy or appo intment proceeding.  If the testacy of the 18 
decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been 19 
adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration must include the 20 
matters required of a petition in a form al testacy proceeding and the notice requirements 21 
and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply.  If not previously 22 
adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to 23 
the priority and qualificatio ns of the personal representative in any case involving a 24 
request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised 25 
administration may be denied.  After notice to interested persons:  26 
1.  Will directing supervised administration.  If the  decedent's will directs 27 
supervised administration, the court must order supervised administration of the 28 
decedent's estate unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for 29 
supervised administration have changed since the execution of the will and that there is 30 
no necessity for supervised administration;  31 
2.  Will directing unsupervised administration.  If the decedent's will directs 32 
unsupervised administration, the court may order supervised administration of the 33 
decedent's estate only upon  a finding that it is necessary for protection of persons 34 
interested in the estate; or  35 
3.  Other cases.  In other cases when the court finds that supervised administration is 36 
necessary under the circumstances, the court must order supervised administration  of the 37 
decedent's estate.  38 
 
 Page 125 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-503.  Supervised administration; effect on other proceedings  1 
1.  Effect on application for informal proceedings.  The pendency of a proceeding 2 
for supervised administration of a decedent's estate stays action on any informal 3 
application then pending or thereafter filed.  4 
2.  Effect on will probated in informal proceedings.  If a will has been previously 5 
probated in informal proceedings, the effect of the filing of a petition for supervised 6 
administration is as provided for forma l testacy proceedings by section 3 -401. 7 
3.  Effect on personal representative.  After receiving notice of the filing of a 8 
petition for supervised administration, a personal representative who has been appointed 9 
previously may not exercise the power to dist ribute any estate.  The filing of the petition 10 
does not affect the personal representative's other powers and duties unless the court 11 
restricts the exercise of any of them pending full hearing on the petition.  12 
§3-504.  Supervised administration; powers of personal representative  13 
Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without 14 
interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives 15 
under this Code, but the personal representative may not exercise  the power to make any 16 
distribution of the estate without prior order of the court.  Any other restriction on the 17 
power of a personal representative that is ordered by the court must be endorsed on the 18 
personal representative's letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as 19 
to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.  20 
§3-505.  Supervised administration; interim orders; distribution and closing orders  21 
Unless otherwise ordered by the court, supervised administration is  terminated by 22 
order in accordance with time restrictions, notices and contents of orders prescribed for 23 
proceedings under section 3 -1001.  Interim orders approving or directing partial 24 
distributions or granting other relief may be issued by the court at a ny time during the 25 
pendency of a supervised administration on the application of the personal representative 26 
or any interested person.  27 
PART 6  28 
PERSONAL REPRESENTAT IVE: APPOINTMENT, CO NTROL AND 29 
TERMINATION OF AUTHO RITY  30 
§3-601.  Qualification  31 
Prior to receivi ng letters, a personal representative must qualify by filing with the 32 
appointing court any required bond and a statement of acceptance of the duties of the 33 
office.  34 
§3-602.  Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction  35 
By accepting appointment, a pers onal representative submits personally to the 36 
jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by 37 
 
 Page 126 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 any interested person.  Notice of any proceeding must be delivered to the personal 1 
representative, or mailed to the p ersonal representative by ordinary first class mail at the 2 
address listed in the application or petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the 3 
court and to the personal representative's address as then known to the petitioner.  4 
§3-603.  Bond not required without court order; exceptions  5 
Bond is not required of a personal representative appointed in informal proceedings, 6 
except upon the appointment of a special administrator, when an executor or other 7 
personal representative is appointed to administ er an estate under a will containing an 8 
express requirement of bond or when bond is required under section 3 -605.  Bond may be 9 
required by court order at the time of appointment of a personal representative appointed 10 
in any formal proceeding except that bo nd is not required of a personal representative 11 
appointed in formal proceedings if the will relieves the personal representative of bond, 12 
unless bond has been requested by an interested party and the court is satisfied that it is 13 
desirable, or as provided in section 3 -619, subsection 7.  Bond required by any will or 14 
under this section may be dispensed with in formal proceedings upon determination by 15 
the court that it is not necessary.  Bond is not required of any personal representative 16 
who, pursuant to sta tute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of this State to 17 
secure performance of the personal representative's duties.  18 
§3-604.  Bond amount; security; procedure; reduction  19 
If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not speci fy the amount, 20 
unless stated in the application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement 21 
under oath with the register indicating that person's best estimate of the value of the 22 
personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected fro m the personal and real 23 
estate during the next year, and that person shall execute and file a bond with the register, 24 
or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate.  The register shall 25 
determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual 26 
sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real 27 
property or other adequate security.  The register may permit the amount of the bond to 28 
be reduced by the value of assets o f the estate deposited with a domestic financial 29 
institution, as defined in section 6 -101, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized 30 
disposition.  On petition of the personal representative or another interested person the 31 
court may excuse a requirement  of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, 32 
release sureties or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different 33 
sureties.  34 
§3-605.  Demand for bond by interested person  35 
Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth  in excess of $5,000, or 36 
any creditor having a claim in excess of $5,000, may make a written demand that a 37 
personal representative give bond.  The demand must be filed with the register and a copy 38 
mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and q ualification have occurred.  39 
Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond 40 
ceases to be interested in the estate or if bond is excused as provided in section 3 -603 or 41 
3-604.  After the personal representative has rece ived notice and until the filing of the 42 
bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain 43 
 
 Page 127 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 from exercising any powers of the personal representative's office except as necessary to 1 
preserve the estate.  Failure of the p ersonal representative to meet a requirement of bond 2 
by giving suitable bond within 30 days after receipt of notice is cause for the personal 3 
representative's removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.  4 
§3-606.  Terms and conditions of bonds  5 
1.  Required terms and conditions.  The following requirements and provisions 6 
apply to any bond required by this Part.  7 
A.  Bonds must name the State of Maine as obligee for the benefit of the persons 8 
interested in the estate and must be conditioned u pon the faithful discharge by the 9 
fiduciary of all duties according to law.  10 
B.  Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly 11 
and severally liable with the personal representative and with each other.  The 12 
address of sur eties must be stated in the bond.  13 
C.  By executing an approved bond of a personal representative, the surety consents 14 
to the jurisdiction of the court that issued letters to the primary obligor in any 15 
proceedings pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the p ersonal representative and 16 
naming the surety as a party.  Notice of any proceeding must be delivered to the 17 
surety or mailed to the surety by registered or certified mail at the surety's address as 18 
listed with the court where the bond is filed and to the s urety's address as then known 19 
to the petitioner.  20 
D.  On petition of a successor personal representative, any other personal 21 
representative of the same decedent or any interested person, a proceeding in the 22 
court may be initiated against a surety for breach  of the obligation of the bond of the 23 
personal representative.  24 
E.  The bond of the personal representative is not void after the first recovery but may 25 
be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.  26 
2.  Limitation on action ag ainst surety.  An action or proceeding may not be 27 
commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against 28 
the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.  29 
§3-607.  Order restraining personal representative  30 
On peti tion of any person who appears to have an interest in the estate, the court by 31 
temporary order may restrain a personal representative from performing specified acts of 32 
administration, disbursement or distribution, or exercise of any powers or discharge of 33 
any duties of the personal representative's office, or make any other order to secure 34 
proper performance of the personal representative's duty, if it appears to the court that the 35 
personal representative otherwise may take some action that would jeopardize  36 
unreasonably the interest of the applicant or of some other interested person.  Persons 37 
with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made parties.  38

 §3-608.  Termination of appointment; general  1 
Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in 2 
sections 3 -609 to 3 -612.  Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of 3 
personal representative as conferred by this Code or any will, except that a personal 4 
representative, at any time prior to dist ribution or until restrained or enjoined by court 5 
order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a 6 
successor representative.  Termination does not discharge a personal representative from 7 
liability for transactions or  omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the personal 8 
representative of the duty to preserve assets subject to the personal representative's 9 
control and to account for and to deliver the assets.  Termination does not affect the 10 
jurisdiction of t he court over the personal representative, but terminates the personal 11 
representative's authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.  12 
§3-609.  Termination of appointment; death or disability  13 
The death of a personal representative o r the appointment of a conservator for the 14 
estate of a personal representative terminates the personal representative's appointment.  15 
Until appointment and qualification of a successor or special personal representative to 16 
replace the deceased or protected  personal representative, the personal representative of 17 
the estate of the deceased or protected personal representative, if any, has the duty to 18 
protect the estate possessed and being administered by the personal representative's 19 
decedent or ward at the t ime the personal representative's appointment terminates, has the 20 
power to perform acts necessary for protection and shall account for and deliver the estate 21 
assets to a successor or special personal representative upon the successor personal 22 
representativ e's appointment and qualification.  23 
§3-610.  Termination of appointment; voluntary  24 
1.  One year after closing of estate by sworn statement.  An appointment of a 25 
personal representative terminates as provided in section 3 -1003, one year after the filing 26 
of a closing statement.  27 
2.  Upon court order closing an estate.  An order closing an estate as provided in 28 
section 3 -1001 or 3 -1002 terminates an appointment of a personal representative.  29 
3.  Resignation; effect.  A personal representative may resign by filing  a written 30 
statement of resignation with the register after the personal representative has given at 31 
least 15 days' written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate.  If no one 32 
applies or petitions for appointment of a successor represent ative within the time 33 
indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of 34 
appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of 35 
a successor representative and delivery of the ass ets to the successor representative.  36 
§3-611.  Termination of appointment by removal; cause; procedure  37 
1.  Petition for removal of personal representative.  A person interested in the 38 
estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at  any time.  Upon 39 
filing of the petition, the court shall fix a time and place for hearing.  Notice must be 40 
 
 Page 129 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 given by the petitioner to the personal representative and to other persons as the court 1 
may order.  Except as otherwise ordered as provided in secti on 3 -607, after receipt of 2 
notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative may not act except to account, 3 
to correct maladministration or to preserve the estate.  If removal is ordered, the court 4 
also shall direct by order the disposition of the  assets remaining in the name of, or under 5 
the control of, the personal representative being removed.  6 
2.  Grounds for removal.  Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the 7 
best interests of the estate or if it is shown that a personal representat ive or the person 8 
seeking the personal representative's appointment intentionally misrepresented material 9 
facts in the proceedings leading to the appointment or that the personal representative has 10 
disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of  discharging the duties of the 11 
office, has mismanaged the estate or has failed to perform any duty pertaining to the 12 
office.  Unless the decedent's will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed 13 
at the decedent's domicile, incident to securing  appointment as ancillary personal 14 
representative or the appointment of a nominee as ancillary personal representative, may 15 
obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this State to 16 
administer local assets.  17 
§3-612.  Termination o f appointment; change of testacy status  18 
Except as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent 19 
to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will that is 20 
superseded by formal probate of another will, o r the vacation of an informal probate of a 21 
will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative under the will, does not 22 
terminate the appointment of the personal representative although the personal 23 
representative's powers may be reduced as p rovided in section 3 -401.  Termination occurs 24 
upon appointment in informal or formal appointment proceedings of a person entitled to 25 
appointment under the later assumption concerning testacy.  If no request for new 26 
appointment is made within 30 days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in 27 
formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption 28 
concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be 29 
appointed personal representative und er the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy 30 
as the case may be.  31 
§3-613.  Successor personal representative  32 
Parts 3 and 4 of this Article govern proceedings for appointment of a personal 33 
representative to succeed a personal representative whose ap pointment has been 34 
terminated.  After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may 35 
be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative 36 
was a party, and no notice, process or claim that was giv en or served upon the former 37 
personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve 38 
any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have 39 
obtained or preserved with reference to the form er personal representative.  Except as 40 
otherwise ordered by the court, the successor personal representative has the powers and 41 
duties in respect to the continued administration that the former personal representative 42 
would have had if the appointment had not been terminated.  43 
 
 Page 130 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-614.  Special administrator; appointment  1 
A special administrator may be appointed:  2 
1.  Informal proceedings.  Informally by the register on the application of any 3 
interested person when necessary to protect the estate of a decedent prior to the 4 
appointment of a general personal representative or if a prior appointment has been 5 
terminated as provided in section 3 -609; and  6 
2.  Formal proceedings.  In a formal proceeding by order of the court on the petition 7 
of any interested person and  finding, after notice and hearing, that appointment is 8 
necessary to preserve the estate or to secure its proper administration including its 9 
administration in circumstances where a general personal representative cannot or should 10 
not act.  If it appears t o the court that an emergency exists, appointment may be ordered 11 
without notice.  12 
§3-615.  Special administrator; who may be appointed  13 
1.  Named executor, if available.  If a special administrator is to be appointed 14 
pending the probate of a will that is the  subject of a pending application or petition for 15 
probate, the person named executor in the will must be appointed if available and 16 
qualified.  17 
2.  Any proper person.  In cases other than those set out in subsection 1, any proper 18 
person may be appointed spe cial administrator.  19 
§3-616.  Special administrator; appointed informally; powers and duties  20 
A special administrator appointed by the register in informal proceedings pursuant to 21 
section 3 -614, subsection 1 has the duty to collect and manage the assets of t he estate, to 22 
preserve them, to account for them and to deliver them to the general personal 23 
representative upon the general personal representative's qualification.  The special 24 
administrator has the power of a personal representative under the Code neces sary to 25 
perform the special administrator's duties.  26 
§3-617.  Special administrator; formal proceedings; power and duties  27 
A special administrator appointed by order of the court in any formal proceeding has 28 
the power of a general personal representative exc ept as limited in the appointment and 29 
duties as prescribed in the order.  The appointment may be for a specified time, to 30 
perform particular acts or on other terms as the court may direct.  31 
§3-618.  Termination of appointment; special administrator  32 
The appo intment of a special administrator terminates in accordance with the 33 
provisions of the order of appointment or on the appointment of a general personal 34 
representative.  In other cases, the appointment of a special administrator is subject to 35 
termination as  provided in sections 3 -608 to 3 -611. 36 
 
 Page 131 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-619.  Public administrators  1 
1.  Public administrators; appointment; powers and duties.  The Governor shall 2 
appoint in each county for a term of 4 years, unless sooner removed, a public 3 
administrator who shall, upon petition to the court and after notice and hearing, be 4 
appointed to administer the estates of persons who die intestate within the county, or who 5 
die intestate elsewhere leaving property within the county, and who are not known to 6 
have within the state any  heirs who can lawfully inherit the estate, and for whom no other 7 
administration has been commenced.  The public administrator has the same powers and 8 
duties of a personal representative under supervised administration as provided in section 9 
3-504 and, exc ept as provided in subsection 7, shall give bond as provided for other 10 
personal representatives in cases of ordinary administration under sections 3 -603 to 11 
3-606.  If any person entitled to appointment as personal representative under section 12 
3-203, prior to the appointment of the public administrator, files a petition for informal or 13 
formal appointment as personal representative, the court shall withhold any appointment 14 
of the public administrator pending denial of the petition for the appointment of the 15 
private personal representative.  16 
2.  Compensation.  The public administrator may be allowed fees and compensation 17 
for the public administrator's services as in the case of ordinary administration as 18 
provided in sections 3 -719 to 3 -721, except that no fee fo r the public administrator's own 19 
services may be paid without prior approval by the court.  20 
3.  Authority pending appointment.  Pending the appointment of the public 21 
administrator, and in the absence of any local administration or any administration by a 22 
domiciliary foreign personal representative under sections 4 -204 and 4 -205, the public 23 
administrator may proceed to conserve the property of the estate when it appears 24 
necessary or expedient.  25 
4.  Termination.  If before the estate of a decedent in the hands of the public 26 
administrator is fully settled any last will and testament of the decedent is granted 27 
informal or formal probate, or if any person entitled under section 3 -203 to appointment 28 
as personal representative is informally or formally appointed, the  appointment of the 29 
public administrator is terminated as provided in section 3 -608, and the public 30 
administrator shall account for and deliver the assets of the estate to the private personal 31 
representative or to the successors under the will as provided by law if no private 32 
personal representative has been appointed.  33 
5.  Decedent's assets disposed of as unclaimed property.  When there are assets 34 
other than real property remaining in the hands of the public administrator after the 35 
payment of the decedent's  debts and all costs of administration and no heirs have been 36 
discovered, the public administrator must be ordered by the court to deposit the assets 37 
with the Treasurer of State, who shall receive the assets and dispose of them according to 38 
Title 33, chapt er 41.  These assets must, for the purposes of Title 33, chapter 41, be 39 
presumed unclaimed when the court orders the public administrator to deposit them with 40 
the Treasurer of State.  41 
6.  Notice to treasurer; annual audit.  In all cases where a public admin istrator is 42 
appointed, the register shall immediately send to the Treasurer of State a copy of the 43 
 
 Page 132 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 petition and the decree, and in all cases in which the public administrator is ordered to 1 
pay the balance of the estate as provided in subsection 5 the court  shall give notice to the 2 
county treasurer of the amount and from what estate it is receivable.  If the public 3 
administrator neglects for 3 months after the order of the court to deposit the money, the 4 
county treasurer shall petition the court for enforcem ent of the order or bring a civil 5 
action upon any bond of the public administrator for the recovery of the money.  The 6 
records and accounts of the public administrator must be audited annually by the Office 7 
of the State Auditor.  8 
7.  Exemption from notice a nd bond requirements.  Estates administered under 9 
this section having a value at the decedent's death not exceeding $5,000 are exempt from 10 
all notice and filing costs and from giving bond.  The cost of notice must be paid by the 11 
court.  12 
PART 7  13 
DUTIES AND PO WERS OF PERSONAL REP RESENTATIVES  14 
§3-701.  Time of accrual of duties and powers  15 
The duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon appointment.  16 
The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person 17 
appointed t hat are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect 18 
as those occurring after appointment.  Subject to the priorities of Title 22, section 19 
2843 -A, prior to appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written 20 
instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent's body, funeral and burial 21 
arrangements.  A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the 22 
estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal 23 
representative.  24 
§3-702.  Priority among different letters  25 
A person to whom general letters are first issued has exclusive authority under the 26 
letters until that person's appointment is terminated or modified.  If through error general 27 
letters are later issued to another, the  first appointed representative may recover any 28 
property of the estate in the hands of the representative subsequently appointed, but the 29 
acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want 30 
of validity of appointm ent. 31 
§3-703.  General duties; relation and liability to persons interested in estate; 32 
standing to sue  33 
1.  General duties.  A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the 34 
standards of care applicable to trustees.  A personal representative i s under a duty to settle 35 
and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and 36 
effective will and this Code, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the 37 
best interests of the estate.  The personal rep resentative shall use the authority conferred 38 
upon the personal representative by this Code, the terms of the will, if any, and any order 39 
in proceedings to which the personal representative is party for the best interests of 40 
 
 Page 133 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 successors to the estate.  A pe rsonal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the 1 
standards of care applicable to trustees as described in Title 18 -B, sections 802, 803, 805, 2 
806 and 807 and Title 18 -B, chapter 9, except as follows.  3 
A.  A personal representative, in developing a n investment strategy, shall take into 4 
account the expected duration of the period reasonably required to effect distribution 5 
of the estate's assets.  6 
B.  Except as provided in section 3 -906, subsection 1, paragraphs A and B, a personal 7 
representative may m ake distribution of an estate's assets in cash or in kind, in 8 
accordance with the devisees' best interests, and is not required either to liquidate the 9 
estate's assets or to preserve them for distribution.  10 
C.  If all devisees whose devises are to be funded  from the residue of an estate agree, 11 
in a written instrument signed by each of them and presented to the personal 12 
representative, on an investment manager to direct the investment of the estate's 13 
residuary assets, the personal representative may, but need  not, rely on the investment 14 
advice of the investment manager so identified or delegate the investment 15 
management of the estate's residuary assets to the investment manager and, in either 16 
case, may pay reasonable compensation to the investment manager from  the residue 17 
of the estate.  A personal representative who relies on the advice of, or delegates 18 
management discretion to, an investment manager in accordance with the terms of 19 
this section is not liable for the investment performance of the assets investe d in the 20 
discretion of, or in accordance with the advice of, the investment manager.  21 
2.  Authority.  A personal representative may not be surcharged for acts of 22 
administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time.  23 
Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to 24 
administer and distribute the estate according to its terms.  An order of appointment of a 25 
personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is aut hority to 26 
distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of 27 
distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a 28 
proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceedin g, a formal 29 
proceeding questioning the personal representative's appointment or fitness to continue or 30 
a supervised administration proceeding.  This section does not affect the duty of the 31 
personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the 32 
rights of claimants whose claims have been allowed, the surviving spouse, any minor and 33 
dependent children and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in 34 
this Code.  35 
3.  Standing to sue.  Except as to proceedings th at do not survive the death of the 36 
decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this State at the decedent's 37 
death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this State and the courts of 38 
any other jurisdiction as the decede nt had immediately prior to death.  39 
§3-704.  Personal representative to proceed without court order; exception  40 
A personal representative shall proceed expeditiously with the settlement and 41 
distribution of a decedent's estate and, except as otherwise specifi ed or ordered in regard 42 
to a supervised personal representative, do so without adjudication, order or direction of 43 
 
 Page 134 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the court, but the personal representative may invoke the jurisdiction of the court in 1 
proceedings authorized by this Code to resolve questio ns concerning the estate or its 2 
administration.  3 
§3-705.  Duty of personal representative; information to heirs and devisees  4 
Not later than 30 days after appointment every personal representative, except any 5 
special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, 6 
including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal 7 
representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the 8 
devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal 9 
representative.  The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the 10 
heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative.  11 
The duty does not extend to require informati on to persons who have been adjudicated in 12 
a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate.  The information must 13 
include a statement that the estate is being administered by the personal representative 14 
under the Code without supervisio n by the court but that recipients are entitled to 15 
information regarding the administration from the personal representative and may 16 
petition the court in any matter relating to the estate, including distribution of assets and 17 
expenses of administration.  The information must include the name and address of the 18 
personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have 19 
some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed and 20 
describe the court whe re papers relating to the estate are on file.  The personal 21 
representative's failure to give this information is a breach of duty to the persons 22 
concerned but does not affect the validity of the personal representative's appointment, 23 
powers or other duties .  A personal representative may inform other persons of the 24 
personal representative's appointment by delivery or ordinary first class mail.  25 
§3-706.  Duty of personal representative; inventory and appraisal  26 
1.  Duty to file or mail inventory.  Within 3 mon ths after appointment, a personal 27 
representative who is not a special administrator or a successor to another personal 28 
representative who has previously discharged this duty shall prepare and file with the 29 
court or mail to all interested persons an invento ry of property owned by the decedent at 30 
the time of death, listing it with reasonable detail and indicating as to each listed item its 31 
fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death and the type and amount of any 32 
encumbrance that may exist with r eference to any item.  The inventory must also include 33 
a schedule of credits of the decedent, with the names of the obligors, the amounts due, a 34 
description of the nature of the obligation and the amount of all such credits, exclusive of 35 
expenses and risk of settlement or collection.  36 
2.  Inventory furnished on request.  If the personal representative filed the 37 
inventory with the court pursuant to subsection 1, the personal representative shall furnish 38 
the inventory to interested persons who request it.  If the personal representative mailed 39 
the inventory to all interested persons who requested it pursuant to subsection 1, the 40 
personal representative may also file the inventory with the court.  41 
3.  Failure to file, mail or furnish inventory; missing property.  When an 42 
inventory has not been filed, mailed or furnished as required under subsection 1 or 2 and 43 
 
 Page 135 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 an interested party makes a prima facie case that property that should have been 1 
inventoried is now missing, the personal representative has the burden of pr oving by a 2 
preponderance of the evidence that the specific property would properly be excluded 3 
from the inventory.  4 
§3-707.  Employment of appraisers  5 
The personal representative may employ a qualified and disinterested appraiser to 6 
assist in ascertaining th e fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death of any 7 
asset the value of which may be subject to reasonable doubt.  Different persons may be 8 
employed to appraise different kinds of assets included in the estate.  The names and 9 
addresses of any appraiser must be indicated on the inventory with the item or items 10 
appraised.  11 
§3-708.  Duty of personal representative; supplementary inventory  12 
If any property not included in the original inventory comes to the knowledge of a 13 
personal representative or i f the personal representative learns that the value or 14 
description indicated in the original inventory for any item is erroneous or misleading, the 15 
personal representative shall make a supplementary inventory or appraisement showing 16 
the market value as of the date of the decedent's death of the new item or the revised 17 
market value or descriptions, and the appraisers or other data relied upon, if any, and file 18 
the supplementary inventory or appraisement with the court or mail or furnish copies of 19 
the supplem entary inventory or appraisement or information about the supplementary 20 
inventory or appraisement to persons interested in the new information.  21 
§3-709.  Duty of personal representative; possession of estate  22 
Except as otherwise provided by a decedent's will , every personal representative has a 23 
right to and shall take possession or control of the decedent's property, except that any 24 
real property or tangible personal property may be left with or surrendered to the person 25 
presumptively entitled to it until, in  the judgment of the personal representative, 26 
possession of the property by the personal representative will be necessary for purposes 27 
of administration.  The request by a personal representative for delivery of any property 28 
possessed by an heir or devisee  is conclusive evidence in any action against the heir or 29 
devisee for possession of the property that the possession of the property by the personal 30 
representative is necessary for purposes of administration.  The personal representative 31 
shall pay taxes on  and take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection 32 
and preservation of the estate in the personal representative's possession.  The personal 33 
representative may maintain an action to recover possession of property or to determine 34 
the ti tle of the property.  35 
§3-710.  Power to avoid transfers  36 
The property liable for the payment of unsecured debts of a decedent includes all 37 
property transferred by the decedent by any means that is in law void or voidable as 38 
against the decedent's creditors, and, subject to prior liens, the right to recover this 39 
property, so far as necessary for the payment of unsecured debts of the decedent, is 40 
exclusively in the personal representative.  The personal representative is not required to 41 
 
 Page 136 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 institute such an action  unless requested by creditors, who must pay or secure the cost and 1 
expenses of litigation.  2 
§3-711.  Powers of personal representatives; in general  3 
Until termination of the personal representative's appointment, a personal 4 
representative has the same power  over the title to property of the estate that an absolute 5 
owner would have, in trust however, for the benefit of the creditors and others interested 6 
in the estate.  This power may be exercised without notice, hearing or order of court.  7 
§3-712.  Improper e xercise of power; breach of fiduciary duty  8 
If the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative 9 
is liable to interested persons for damage or loss resulting from breach of the personal 10 
representative's fiduciary duty to t he same extent as a trustee of an express trust.  The 11 
rights of purchasers and others dealing with a personal representative must be determined 12 
as provided in sections 3 -713 and 3 -714. 13 
§3-713.  Sale, encumbrance or transaction involving conflict of interes t; voidable; 14 
exceptions  15 
Any sale or encumbrance to the personal representative, the personal representative's 16 
spouse, agent or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which the personal representative 17 
has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transact ion that is affected by a substantial 18 
conflict of interest on the part of the personal representative, is voidable by any person 19 
interested in the estate except a person who has consented after fair disclosure, unless:  20 
1.  Express authorization by decedent .  The will or a contract entered into by the 21 
decedent expressly authorized the transaction; or  22 
2.  Court approval.  The transaction is approved by the court after notice to 23 
interested persons.  24 
§3-714.  Persons dealing with personal representative; protect ion 25 
A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the 26 
personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative's power was 27 
properly exercised.  The fact that a person knowingly deals with a person al representative 28 
does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety 29 
of its exercise.  Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives 30 
that are endorsed on letters as provided in section 3 -504, no provision in any will or order 31 
of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to 32 
persons with actual knowledge.  A person is not bound to see to the proper application of 33 
estate assets paid or delivered to  a personal representative.  The protection in this section 34 
extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect 35 
occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the 36 
alleged decedent is fo und to be alive.  The protection in this section is not by substitution 37 
for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial 38 
transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.  39

personal representatives and employees of estate  29

person or on appropriate motion if administration is supervised, the propriety of 31 
employment of any person by a personal representative, including any attorney, auditor, 32 
investment advisor or other specialized agent or assistant, the reasonable ness of the 33 
compensation of any person so employed or the reasonableness of the compensation 34

may be reviewed by the court.  Any person who has received excessive compe nsation 36 
from an estate for services rendered may be ordered to make appropriate refunds.  37 
2.  Reasonable fee factors.  Factors to be considered as guides in determining the 38 
reasonableness of a fee include the following:  39

B.  The likelihood, if apparent to the personal representative, that the acceptance of 3 
the particular employment will preclude the person employed fr om other 4 
employment;  5 
C.  The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services;  6 
D.  The amount involved and the results obtained;  7 
E.  The time limitations imposed by the personal representative or by the 8 
circumstances; and  9 
F.  The experience, re putation and ability of the person performing the services.  10

§3-802.  Statutes of limitations  29 
1.  Applicability of statutes of limitations; waiver.  Unless an estate is insolvent, 30 
the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interes ts would be 31 
affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate.  If the defense is 32 
not waived, no claim barred by a statute of limitations at the time of the decedent's death 33 
may be allowed or paid.  34 
2.  Suspension for 4 months after dea th.  The running of any statute of limitations 35

 3.  Commenceme nt of action by presentation of claim.  For purposes of any statute 1 
of limitations, the presentation of a claim pursuant to section 3 -804 is equivalent to 2 
commencement of a proceeding on the claim.  3 
§3-803.  Limitations on presentation of claims  4 
1.  Claims arising before death.  All claims against a decedent's estate that arose 5 
before the death of the decedent, including claims of the State and any subdivision of the 6

after the death of the decedent, including claims of the State and any subdivision of the 20

 Page 143 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-804.  Manner of presentation of claims  1 
Claims against a decedent's estate may be presented as described in this section.  2 
1.  Written statement of claim.  The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal 3 
representative a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address 4 
of the claimant and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in 5 
the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court.  The claim is deemed presented 6 
on the first  to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal 7 
representative or the filing of the claim with the court.  If a claim is not yet due, the date 8 
when it will become due must be stated.  If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the 9 
nature of the uncertainty must be stated.  If the claim is secured, the security must be 10 
described.  Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty and the 11 
due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation made.  12 
2.  Proceeding on claim.  The claimant may commence a proceeding against the 13 
personal represensative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected 14 
to jurisdiction to obtain payment of the claimant's claim against the estate, but the 15 
comm encement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the 16 
claim.  No presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings 17 
against the decedent that were pending at the time of death.  18 
3.  Time limit for procee ding after disallowance.  If a claim is presented under 19 
subsection 1, no proceeding on the claim may be commenced more than 60 days after the 20 
personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim 21 
that is not presently due  or that is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative 22 
may consent to an extension of the 60 -day period or, to avoid injustice, the court on 23 
petition may order an extension of the 60 -day period, but in no event may the extension 24 
run beyond the  applicable statute of limitations.  25 
4.  Presenting claims before administration.  When a decedent's estate has not been 26 
commenced at the time a claimant wishes to present a claim, a claim is deemed presented 27 
when the claimant files with the clerk of the co urt a written statement of claim meeting 28 
the requirements of subsection 1 and a demand for notice pursuant to section 3 -204.  The 29 
provisions of subsection 3 apply upon the appointment of a personal representative.  30 
§3-805.  Classification of claims  31 
1.  Priority of claims.  If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all 32 
claims in full, the personal representative shall make payment in the following order:  33 
A.  Costs and expenses of administration;  34 
B.  Reasonable funeral expenses;  35 
C.  Debts and taxes with preference under federal law;  36 
D.  Medicaid benefits recoverable under Title 22, section 14, subsection 2 -I and 37 
reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the 38 
decedent, including compensation of persons atte nding the decedent;  39 
 
 Page 144 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 E.  Debts and taxes with preference under other laws of this State; and  1 
F.  All other claims.  2 
2.  No priority within class or for claims not due.  Preference may not be given in 3 
the payment of any claim over any other claim of the same class, and a claim due and 4 
payable is not entitled to a preference over claims not due.  5 
§3-806.  Allowance of claims  6 
1.  Allowance or disallowance by personal representative.  As to claims presented 7 
in the manner described in section 3 -804 within the time limit prescribed in section 8 
3-803, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim 9 
has been disallowed.  If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative 10 
changes the decision concerning the claim, the personal representative shall notify the 11 
claimant.  The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the 12 
time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the 13 
claim has run and the claim has  been barred.  Every claim that is disallowed in whole or 14 
in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant 15 
files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal 16 
representative n ot later than 60 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or 17 
partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar.  Failure of the 18 
personal representative to mail notice to a claimant of action on the claim for 60 days 19 
after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice 20 
of allowance.  21 
2.  Change of claim status by personal representative.  After allowing or 22 
disallowing a claim, the personal representative may change the allowance or 23 
disallowance as provided in this subsection.  The personal representative may prior to 24 
payment change the allowance to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after 25 
allowance by a court order or judgment or an order directing payment of the claim.  The 26 
personal representative shall notify the claimant of the change to disallowance, and the 27 
disallowed claim is then subject to bar as provided in subsection 1.  The personal 28 
representative may change a disallowance to an allowance, in whole or in part, until it  is 29 
barred under subsection 1; after it is barred, it may be allowed and paid only if the estate 30 
is solvent and all successors whose interests would be affected consent.  31 
3.  Allowance by court.  Upon the petition of the personal representative or of a 32 
claimant in a proceeding for the purpose, the court may allow in whole or in part any 33 
claim or claims presented to the personal representative or filed with the clerk of the court 34 
in due time and not barred by subsection 1.  Notice in this proceeding must be g iven to 35 
the claimant, the personal representative and those other persons interested in the estate as 36 
the court may direct by order entered at the time the proceeding is commenced.  37 
4.  Judgment of another court; effect.  A judgment in a proceeding in anoth er court 38 
against a personal representative to enforce a claim against a decedent's estate is an 39 
allowance of the claim.  40 
5.  Interest.  Unless otherwise provided in any judgment in another court entered 41 
against the personal representative, allowed claims be ar prejudgment interest at the rate 42 
 
 Page 145 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 specified in Title 14, section 1602 -B for the period commencing 60 days after the time for 1 
original presentation of the claim has expired unless based on a contract making a 2 
provision for interest, in which case they bea r interest in accordance with that provision.  3 
A.  Interest may not accrue on any allowed claims, however allowed, against an 4 
insolvent estate, except to the extent that insurance coverage or other nonprobate 5 
assets are available to pay the claim in full.  6 
B.  To the extent that an allowed claim against an insolvent estate is secured by 7 
property, the value of which, as determined under section 3 -809, is greater than the 8 
amount of the claim, the holder of the claim may receive interest on the principal 9 
amount of the claim and any reasonable fees, costs or charges provided for under an 10 
agreement under which the claim arose.  11 
§3-807.  Payment of claims  12 
1.  Payment upon expiration of limitations period.  Upon the expiration of the 13 
earlier of the time limitations pr ovided in section 3 -803 for the presentation of claims, the 14 
personal representative shall proceed to pay the claims allowed against the estate in the 15 
order of priority prescribed, after making provision for homestead, family and support 16 
allowances, for cla ims already presented that have not yet been allowed or whose 17 
allowance has been appealed, and for unbarred claims that may yet be presented, 18 
including costs and expenses of administration.  By petition to the court in a proceeding 19 
for the purpose, or by a ppropriate motion if the administration is supervised, a claimant 20 
whose claim has been allowed but not paid may secure an order directing the personal 21 
representative to pay the claim to the extent that funds of the estate are available to pay it.  22 
2.  Earli er payment; liability of personal representative.  The personal 23 
representative at any time may pay any just claim that has not been barred, with or 24 
without formal presentation, but the personal representative is personally liable to any 25 
other claimant whos e claim is allowed and who is injured by its payment if:  26 
A.  Payment was made before the expiration of the time limit stated in subsection 1 27 
and the personal representative failed to require the payee to give adequate security 28 
for the refund of any of the payment necessary to pay other claimants; or  29 
B.  Payment was made, due to the negligence or willful fault of the personal 30 
representative, in a manner that deprives the injured claimant of priority.  31 
§3-808.  Individual liability of personal representative  32 
1.  Contractual liability.  Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a personal 33 
representative is not individually liable on a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary 34 
capacity in the course of administration of the estate unless the personal represe ntative 35 
fails to reveal the representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.  36 
2.  Liability for ownership or control of property; torts.  A personal representative 37 
is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of t he estate or for 38 
torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if the personal 39 
representative is personally at fault.  40 
 
 Page 146 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 3.  Proceedings against personal representative in fiduciary capacity.  Claims 1 
based on contracts entered into by a p ersonal representative in a fiduciary capacity, on 2 
obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate or on torts committed in the 3 
course of estate administration may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against 4 
the personal representative  in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the personal 5 
representative is individually liable.  6 
4.  Allocating liability between estate and personal representative.  Issues of 7 
liability as between the estate and the personal representative individually may be  8 
determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge or indemnification or other 9 
appropriate proceeding.  10 
§3-809.  Secured claims  11 
Payment of a secured claim is upon the basis of the amount allowed if the creditor 12 
surrenders the creditor's security; otherwi se payment is upon the basis of one of the 13 
following:  14 
1.  Security exhausted.  If the creditor exhausts the creditor's security before 15 
receiving payment, unless precluded by other law, upon the amount of the claim allowed 16 
less the fair value of the securit y; or 17 
2.  Security not exhausted.  If the creditor does not have the right to exhaust the 18 
creditor's security or has not done so, upon the amount of the claim allowed less the value 19 
of the security determined by converting it into money according to the te rms of the 20 
agreement pursuant to which the security was delivered to the creditor or by the creditor 21 
and personal representative by agreement, arbitration, compromise or litigation.  22 
§3-810.  Claims not due and contingent or unliquidated claims  23 
1.  Claim du e or certain before distribution.  If a claim that will become due at a 24 
future time or a contingent or unliquidated claim becomes due or certain before the 25 
distribution of the estate and if the claim has been allowed or established by a proceeding, 26 
it is p aid in the same manner as presently due and absolute claims of the same class.  27 
2.  Other cases.  In other cases the personal representative or, on petition of the 28 
personal representative or the claimant in a special proceeding for the purpose, the court 29 
may provide for payment as follows:  30 
A.  If the claimant consents, the claimant may be paid the present or agreed value of 31 
the claim, taking any uncertainty into account; or  32 
B.  Arrangement for future payment or possible payment on the happening of the 33 
conti ngency or on liquidation may be made by creating a trust, giving a mortgage, 34 
obtaining a bond or security from a distributee or otherwise.  35 
§3-811.  Counterclaims  36 
In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim that the 37 
estate ha s against the claimant.  In determining a claim against an estate a court shall 38 
reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims 39 
 
 Page 147 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess.  A 1 
counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that 2 
upon which the claim is based.  A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in 3 
amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.  4 
§3-812.  Execution and lev ies prohibited  5 
No execution may issue upon nor may any levy be made against any property of the 6 
estate under any judgment against a decedent or a personal representative, but this section 7 
may not be construed to prevent the enforcement of mortgages, pledge s or liens upon real 8 
or personal property in an appropriate proceeding.  9 
§3-813.  Compromise of claims  10 
When a claim against the estate has been presented in any manner, the personal 11 
representative may, if it appears for the best interest of the estate, comp romise the claim, 12 
whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated.  13 
§3-814.  Encumbered assets  14 
If any assets of the estate are encumbered by mortgage, pledge, lien or other security 15 
interest, the personal representative may pay th e encumbrance or any part of the 16 
encumbrance, renew or extend any obligation secured by the encumbrance or convey or 17 
transfer the assets to the creditor in satisfaction of the lien, in whole or in part, whether or 18 
not the holder of the encumbrance has pres ented a claim, if it appears to be for the best 19 
interest of the estate.  Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the 20 
distributee entitled to the encumbered assets unless the distributee is entitled to 21 
exoneration.  22 
§3-815.  Administration i n more than one state; duty of personal representative  23 
1.  Estate assets subject to all claims, allowances and charges.  All assets of estates 24 
being administered in this State are subject to all claims, allowances and charges existing 25 
or established agains t the personal representative wherever appointed.  26 
2.  Estate insufficient; claimants to receive equal proportion of claims.  If the 27 
estate either in this State or as a whole is insufficient to cover all family exemptions and 28 
allowances determined by the la w of the decedent's domicile, prior charges and claims 29 
after satisfaction of the exemptions, allowances and charges, each claimant whose claim 30 
has been allowed either in this State or elsewhere in administrations of which the personal 31 
representative is awa re is entitled to receive payment of an equal proportion of the 32 
claimant's claim.  If a preference or security in regard to a claim is allowed in another 33 
jurisdiction but not in this State, the creditor so benefited is to receive dividends from 34 
local asset s only upon the balance of the creditor's claim after deducting the amount of 35 
the benefit.  36 
3.  Local assets apply first to claims allowed in this State.  In case the family 37 
exemptions and allowances, prior charges and claims of the entire estate exceed the  total 38 
value of the portions of the estate being administered separately and this State is not the 39 
state of the decedent's last domicile, the claims allowed in this State must be paid their 40 
 
 Page 148 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 proportion if local assets are adequate for the purpose, and the b alance of local assets 1 
must be transferred to the domiciliary personal representative.  If local assets are not 2 
sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this State the amount to which they are entitled, 3 
local assets must be marshalled so that each claim all owed in this State is paid its 4 
proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all dividends on claims allowed in 5 
this State from assets in other jurisdictions.  6 
§3-816.  Final distribution to domiciliary representative  7 
The estate of a nonresident decedent being administered by a personal representative 8 
appointed in this State must, if there is a personal representative of the decedent's 9 
domicile willing to receive it, be distributed to the domiciliary personal representative for 10 
the benefit of the successors of the decedent unless:  11 
1.  Maine law governs.  By virtue of the decedent's will, if any, and applicable 12 
choice of law provisions, the successors are identified pursuant to the law of this State 13 
without reference to the law of the decedent's dom icile;  14 
2.  No domiciliary personal representative exists.  The personal representative of 15 
this State, after reasonable inquiry, is unaware of the existence or identity of a domiciliary 16 
personal representative; or  17 
3.  Court order.  The court orders otherwis e in a proceeding for a closing order 18 
under section 3 -1001 or incident to the closing of a supervised administration.  19 
In other cases, distribution of the estate of a decedent must be made in accordance 20 
with the other Parts of this Article.  21 
§3-817.  Surviva l of actions  22 
1.  Survival of actions.  No personal action or cause of action is lost by the death of 23 
either party, but the same survives for and against the personal representative of the 24 
deceased, except that actions or causes of action for the recovery o f penalties and fines 25 
under criminal statutes do not survive the death of the defendant.  A personal 26 
representative may seek relief from a judgment in an action to which the deceased was a 27 
party to the same extent that the deceased might have done so.  28 
2.  Death of plaintiff or defendant.  When the only plaintiff or defendant dies while 29 
an action that survives is pending, or after its commencement and before entry of 30 
judgment, the decedent's personal representative may appear and enter the action or any 31 
appe al that has been made, and suggest on the record the death of the party.  If the 32 
personal representative does not appear within 90 days after the appointment, the 33 
personal representative may be cited to appear, and after due notice judgment may be 34 
entered against the personal representative by dismissal or default if no such appearance 35 
is made.  36 
3.  Death of one of several plaintiffs or one of several defendants.  When either of 37 
several plaintiffs or defendants in an action that survives dies, the death may be suggested 38 
on the record, and the personal representative of the deceased may appear or be cited to 39 
appear as provided in subsection 2.  The action may be further prosecuted or defended by 40 
 
 Page 149 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the survivors and the personal representative jointly or by eithe r of them.  The survivors, 1 
if any, on both sides of the action may testify as witnesses.  2 
4.  Death of judgment creditor.  When a judgment creditor dies before the first 3 
execution issues or before an execution issued in the judgment creditor's lifetime is f ully 4 
satisfied, the execution may be issued or be effective in favor of the deceased judgment 5 
creditor's personal representative, but an execution may not be issued or be effective 6 
beyond the time within which it would have been effective or issued if the party had not 7 
died.  8 
5.  Execution in favor of deceased judgment creditor.  An execution issued under 9 
subsection 4 must set forth the fact that the judgment creditor has died since the rendition 10 
of the judgment and that the substituted party is the personal  representative of the 11 
decedent's estate.  12 
6.  Liability of personal representative.  The personal representative proceeding 13 
under this section is liable, and shall hold any recovered property or award, in a 14 
representative capacity, except as otherwise prov ided in section 3 -808. 15 
§3-818.  Damages limited to actual damages  16 
In any tort action against the personal representative of a decedent's estate, in the 17 
personal representative's representative capacity, the plaintiff may recover only the value 18 
of the goods  taken or damage actually sustained.  19 
PART 9  20 
SPECIAL PROVISIONS R ELATING TO DISTRIBUT ION  21 
§3-901.  Successors' rights if no administration  22 
In the absence of administration, the heirs and devisees are entitled to the estate in 23 
accordance with the terms of a p robated will or the laws of intestate succession. Devisees 24 
may establish title by the probated will to devised property. Persons entitled to property 25 
by homestead allowance, exemption or intestacy may establish title by proof of the 26 
decedent's ownership an d death and their relationship to the decedent. Successors take 27 
subject to all charges incident to administration, including the claims of creditors and 28 
allowances of surviving spouse and dependent children, and subject to the rights of others 29 
resulting fr om abatement, retainer, advancement and ademption.  30 
§3-902.  Distribution; order in which assets appropriated; abatement  31 
1.  Order in which assets appropriated; abatement.  Except as provided in 32 
subsection 2 and except as provided in connection with the sha re of the surviving spouse 33 
who elects to take an elective share, shares of distributees abate, without any preference 34 
or priority as between real and personal property, in the following order: property not 35 
disposed of by the will, residuary devises, genera l devises and specific devises.  For 36 
purposes of abatement, a general devise charged on any specific property or fund is a 37 
specific devise to the extent of the value of the property on which it is charged, and upon 38 
the failure or insufficiency of the prope rty on which it is charged, a general devise to the 39 
 
 Page 150 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 extent of the failure or insufficiency.  Abatement within each classification is in 1 
proportion to the amounts of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if 2 
full distribution of the property  had been made in accordance with the terms of the will.  3 
2.  Intention of the testator controls.  If the will expresses an order of abatement or 4 
if the testamentary plan or the express or implied purpose of the devise would be defeated 5 
by the order of abat ement stated in subsection 1, the shares of the distributees abate as 6 
may be found necessary to give effect to the intention of the testator.  7 
3.  Adjustments.  If the subject of a preferred devise is sold or used incident to 8 
administration, abatement must be achieved by appropriate adjustments in or contribution 9 
from other interests in the remaining assets.  10 
§3-903.  Right of retainer  11 
The amount of a noncontingent indebtedness of a successor to the estate if due, or its 12 
present value if not due, must be offs et against the successor's interest, but the successor 13 
has the benefit of any defense that would be available to the debtor in a direct proceeding 14 
for recovery of the debt.  The debt constitutes a lien on the successor's interest in favor of 15 
the estate, ha ving priority over any attachment or transfer of the interest by the successor.  16 
§3-904.  Interest on general pecuniary devise  17 
General pecuniary devises bear interest at the legal rate of 5% per year beginning one 18 
year after the first appointment of a perso nal representative until payment, unless a 19 
contrary intent is indicated in the will.  20 
§3-905.  Penalty clause for contest  21 
A provision in a will purporting to penalize any interested person for contesting the 22 
will or instituting other proceedings relating to  the estate is unenforceable if probable 23 
cause exists for instituting proceedings.  24 
§3-906.  Distribution in kind; valuation; method  25 
1.  Distribution in kind; valuation; distribution of residuary estate.  Unless a 26 
contrary intention is indicated by the will , the distributable assets of a decedent's estate 27 
must be distributed in kind to the extent possible through application of the following 28 
provisions.  29 
A.  A specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the thing devised to that devisee, 30 
and a spouse or c hild who has selected particular assets of an estate as provided in 31 
section 2 -403 must receive the items selected.  32 
B.  Any homestead or family allowance or devise of a stated sum of money may be 33 
satisfied by value in kind, in the personal representative's discretion, as long as:  34 
(1)  The person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash;  35 
(2)  The property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date 36 
of its distribution; and  37 
 
 Page 151 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 (3)  No residuary devisee has requested that the asset to be distributed remain a 1 
part of the residue of the estate or, if a residuary devisee has requested that the 2 
asset to be distributed remain a part of the residue of the estate, there are 3 
insufficient other assets to which no residuary devisee has m ade such a request to 4 
permit satisfaction of the estate's obligations and funding of all pecuniary devises 5 
made under the decedent's will.  6 
C.  For the purpose of valuation under paragraph B, securities regularly traded on 7 
recognized exchanges, if distribut ed in kind, are valued at the price for the last sale of 8 
like securities traded on the business day prior to distribution or, if there was no sale 9 
on that day, at the median between amounts bid and offered at the close of that day.  10 
Assets consisting of su ms owed the decedent or the estate by solvent debtors as to 11 
which there is no known dispute or defense are valued at the sum due with accrued 12 
interest or discounted to the date of distribution.  For assets that do not have readily 13 
ascertainable values, a v aluation as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the date 14 
of distribution, if otherwise reasonable, controls. For purposes of facilitating 15 
distribution, the personal representative may ascertain the value of the assets as of the 16 
time of the proposed di stribution in any reasonable way, including the employment of 17 
qualified appraisers, even if the assets may have been previously appraised.  18 
D.  The residuary estate may be distributed by the personal representative in cash or 19 
in kind, in accordance with the  best interests of the residuary devisees.  Residuary 20 
assets may be distributed, at the personal representative's discretion, in pro rata or non 21 
pro rata shares, except that residuary assets not distributed pro rata must be valued as 22 
of the date on which t hey are distributed.  23 
2.  Right of distributee to object.  After the probable charges against the estate are 24 
known, the personal representative may mail or deliver a proposal for distribution to all 25 
persons who have a right to object to the proposed distrib ution. The right of any 26 
distributee to object to the proposed distribution on the basis of the kind or value of asset 27 
the distributee is to receive, if not waived earlier in writing, terminates if the distributee  28 
fails to object in writing received by the  personal representative within 30 days after 29 
mailing or delivery of the proposal.  30 
§3-907.  Distribution in kind; evidence  31 
If distribution in kind is made, the personal representative shall execute an instrument 32 
or deed of distribution assigning, transferr ing or releasing the assets to the distributee as 33 
evidence of the distributee's title to the property.  34 
§3-908.  Distribution; right or title of distributee  35 
Proof that a distributee has received an instrument or deed of distribution of assets in 36 
kind, or pa yment in distribution, from a personal representative, is conclusive evidence 37 
that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the estate in the distributed assets, as 38 
against all persons interested in the estate, except that the personal representati ve may 39 
recover the assets or their value if the distribution was improper.  40 
 
 Page 152 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-909.  Improper distribution; liability of distributee  1 
Unless the distribution or payment no longer can be questioned because of 2 
adjudication, estoppel or limitation, a distribute e of property improperly distributed or 3 
paid, or a claimant who was improperly paid, is liable to return the property improperly 4 
received and its income since distribution if the distributee or claimant has the property.  5 
If the distributee or claimant doe s not have the property, then the distributee or claimant 6 
is liable to return the value as of the date of disposition of the property improperly 7 
received and income and gain received by the distributee or claimant.  8 
§3-910.  Purchasers from distributees pro tected  9 
If property distributed in kind or a security interest in the property is acquired for 10 
value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or 11 
deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is acquired by a purchaser from 12 
or lender to a transferee from a distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of 13 
rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, 14 
or to any interested person, whether or not the distribut ion was proper or supported by 15 
court order or the authority of the personal representative was terminated before 16 
execution of the instrument or deed.  This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a 17 
distributee who, as personal representative, has ex ecuted a deed of distribution to the 18 
personal representative, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or 19 
transferee.  To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire 20 
whether a personal representative acte d properly in making the distribution in kind, even 21 
if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the 22 
authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution.  Any 23 
recorded instrument described i n this section on which the register of deeds notes by an 24 
appropriate stamp "Maine Real Estate Transfer Tax Paid" is prima facie evidence that the 25 
transfer was made for value.  26 
§3-911.  Partition for purpose of distribution  27 
When 2 or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in 28 
any real or personal property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of 29 
the heirs or devisees may petition the court prior to the formal or informal closing of the 30 
estate to make par tition. After notice to the interested heirs or devisees, the court shall 31 
partition the property in the same manner as provided by the law for civil actions of 32 
partition. The court may direct the personal representative to sell any property that cannot 33 
be partitioned without prejudice to the owners and that cannot conveniently be allotted to 34 
any one party.  35 
§3-912.  Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal 36 
representative  37 
Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, co mpetent successors may 38 
agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares or amounts to which they are 39 
entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that 40 
they provide in a written contract executed by all who are af fected by its provisions.  The 41 
personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to the personal 42 
 
 Page 153 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 representative's obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all 1 
taxes and costs of administration and to carry out the responsibilities of the office for the 2 
benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties.  Personal representatives of 3 
decedents' estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee of such 4 
a trust is anoth er person who is willing to accept the trust.  Accordingly, trustees of a 5 
testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section.  Nothing in this section 6 
relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.  7 
§3-913.  Distributions t o trustee  8 
1.  Personal representative authority to require bond.  If the trust instrument does 9 
not excuse the trustee from giving bond, the personal representative may petition the 10 
appropriate court to require that the trustee post bond if the personal rep resentative 11 
apprehends that distribution might jeopardize the interests of persons who are not able to 12 
protect themselves, and the personal representative may withhold distribution until the 13 
court has acted.  14 
2.  Personal representative not negligent for fa iling to require bond.  An 15 
inference of negligence on the part of the personal representative may not be drawn from 16 
the personal representative's failure to exercise the authority conferred by subsection 1.  17 
§3-914.  Disposition of unclaimed assets  18 
If an he ir, devisee or claimant cannot be found, the personal representative shall 19 
distribute the share of the missing person to the person's conservator, if any; otherwise it 20 
must be disposed of according to Title 33, chapter 41.  21 
§3-915.  Distribution to person u nder disability  22 
1.  Discharge according to will.  A personal representative may discharge the 23 
personal representative's obligation to distribute to any person under legal disability by 24 
distributing in a manner expressly provided in the will.  25 
2.  Discharge under section 5 -103 or to conservator.  Unless contrary to an express 26 
provision in the will, a personal representative may discharge the personal 27 
representative's obligation to distribute to a minor or person under other disability as 28 
authorized by section  5-103 or any other statute.  If the personal representative knows 29 
that a conservator has been appointed or that a proceeding for appointment of a 30 
conservator is pending, the personal representative is authorized to distribute only to the 31 
conservator.  32 
3.  Discharge to attorney in fact or close relative.  If the heir or devisee is under 33 
disability other than minority, a personal representative is authorized to distribute to:  34 
A.  An attorney in fact who has authority under a power of attorney to receive 35 
prope rty for that person; or  36 
B.  The spouse, parent or other close relative with whom the person under disability 37 
resides if the distribution is of amounts not exceeding $10,000 a year or property not 38 
 
 Page 154 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 exceeding $10,000 in value, unless the court authorizes a la rger amount or greater 1 
value.  2 
Persons receiving money or property for the person with a disability are obligated to 3 
apply the money or property to the support of that person, but may not pay themselves 4 
except by way of reimbursement for out -of-pocket expen ses for goods and services 5 
necessary for the support of the person with a disability.  Excess sums must be preserved 6 
for future support of the person with a disability.  The personal representative is not 7 
responsible for the proper application of money or property distributed pursuant to this 8 
subsection.  9 
§3-916.  Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act  10 
1.  Short title.  This section may be known and cited as the Uniform Estate Tax 11 
Apportionment Act.  12 
2.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context  otherwise indicates, the 13 
following terms have the following meanings.  14 
A.  "Apportionable estate" means the value of the gross estate as finally determined 15 
for purposes of the estate tax to be apportioned reduced by:  16 
(1)  Any claim or expense allowable as a deduction for purposes of the tax;  17 
(2)  The value of any interest in property that, for purposes of the tax, qualifies 18 
for a marital or charitable deduction or otherwise is deductible or is exempt; and  19 
(3)  Any amount added to the decedent's gross estate  because of a gift tax on 20 
transfers made before death.  21 
B.  "Estate tax" means a federal, state or foreign tax imposed because of the death of 22 
an individual and interest and penalties associated with the tax.  The term does not 23 
include an inheritance tax, i ncome tax or generation -skipping transfer tax other than a 24 
generation -skipping transfer tax incurred on a direct skip taking effect at death.  25 
C.  "Gross estate" means, with respect to an estate tax, all interests in property subject 26 
to the tax.  27 
D.  "Person " means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, 28 
partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, 29 
government, governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality or any other legal 30 
or commercial enti ty. 31 
E.  "Ratable" or "ratably" means apportioned or allocated pro rata according to the 32 
relative values of interests to which the term is to be applied.  33 
F.  "Time -limited interest" means an interest in property that terminates on a lapse of 34 
time or on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or that is subject to the 35 
exercise of discretion that could transfer a beneficial interest to another person.  The 36 
term does not include a cotenancy unless the cotenancy itself is a time -limited 37 
interest.  38 
G.  "Value"  means, with respect to an interest in property, fair market value as finally 39 
determined for purposes of the estate tax that is to be apportioned, reduced by any 40 
 
 Page 155 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 outstanding debt secured by the interest without reduction for taxes paid or required 1 
to be pa id or for any special valuation adjustment.  2 
3.  Apportionment by will or other dispositive instrument.  This subsection 3 
applies when estate tax is apportioned expressly and unambiguously by a will, revocable 4 
trust or other dispositive instrument.  5 
A.  Excep t as otherwise provided in paragraph C:  6 
(1)  To the extent that a provision of a decedent's will expressly and 7 
unambiguously directs the apportionment of an estate tax, the tax must be 8 
apportioned accordingly;  9 
(2)  Any portion of an estate tax not apportio ned pursuant to subparagraph (1) 10 
must be apportioned in accordance with any provision of a revocable trust of 11 
which the decedent was the settlor that expressly and unambiguously directs the 12 
apportionment of an estate tax.  If conflicting apportionment prov isions appear in 13 
2 or more revocable trust instruments, the provision in the most recently dated 14 
instrument prevails.  For purposes of this subparagraph:  15 
(a)  A trust is revocable if it was revocable immediately after the trust 16 
instrument was executed, eve n if the trust subsequently becomes irrevocable; 17 
and 18 
(b)  The date of an amendment to a revocable trust instrument is the date of 19 
the amended instrument only if the amendment contains an apportionment 20 
provision; and  21 
(3)  If any portion of an estate tax is not apportioned pursuant to subparagraph (1) 22 
or (2), and a provision in any other dispositive instrument expressly and 23 
unambiguously directs that any interest in the property disposed of by the 24 
instrument is or is not to be applied to the payment of the es tate tax attributable to 25 
the interest disposed of by the instrument, the provision controls the 26 
apportionment of the tax to that interest.  27 
B.  Subject to paragraph C, and unless the decedent expressly and unambiguously 28 
directs the contrary:  29 
(1)  If an appo rtionment provision directs that a person receiving an interest in 30 
property under an instrument is to be exonerated from the responsibility to pay an 31 
estate tax that would otherwise be apportioned to the interest:  32 
(a)  The tax attributable to the exonerate d interest must be apportioned 33 
among the other persons receiving interests passing under the instrument; or  34 
(b)  If the values of the other interests are less than the tax attributable to the 35 
exonerated interest, the deficiency must be apportioned ratably among the 36 
other persons receiving interests in the apportionable estate that are not 37 
exonerated from apportionment of the tax;  38 
(2)  If an apportionment provision directs that an estate tax is to be apportioned to 39 
an interest in property a portion of which qualifies for a marital or charitable 40 
deduction, the estate tax must first be apportioned ratably among the holders of 41 
the portion that does not qualify for a marital or charitable deduction and then 42 
 
 Page 156 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 apportioned ratably among the holders of the deductible portion to the extent that 1 
the value of the nondeductible portion is insufficient;  2 
(3)  Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (4), if an apportionment 3 
provision directs that an estate tax be apportioned to property in which one or 4 
more time -limited interests exist, other than interests in specified property under 5 
subsection 7, the tax must be apportioned to the principal of that property, 6 
regardless of the deductibility of some of the interests in that property; and  7 
(4)  If an apportionment provision  directs that an estate tax is to be apportioned to 8 
the holders of interests in property in which one or more time -limited interests 9 
exist and a charity has an interest that otherwise qualifies for an estate tax 10 
charitable deduction, the tax must first be apportioned, to the extent feasible, to 11 
interests in property that have not been distributed to the persons entitled to 12 
receive the interests.  13 
C.  A provision that apportions an estate tax is ineffective to the extent that it 14 
increases the tax apportioned to a person having an interest in the gross estate over 15 
which the decedent had no power to transfer immediately before the decedent 16 
executed the instrument in which the apportionment direction was made.  For 17 
purposes of this subsection, a testamentary powe r of appointment is a power to 18 
transfer the property that is subject to the power.  19 
4.  Statutory apportionment of estate taxes.  To the extent that apportionment of an 20 
estate tax is not controlled by an instrument described in subsection 3 and except as 21 
otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7:  22 
A.  Subject to paragraphs B, C and D, the estate tax is apportioned ratably to each 23 
person that has an interest in the apportionable estate;  24 
B.  A generation -skipping transfer tax incurred on a direct skip taking ef fect at death 25 
is charged to the person to whom the interest in property is transferred;  26 
C.  If property is included in the decedent's gross estate pursuant to Section 2044 of 27 
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar estat e 28 
tax provision, the difference between the total estate tax for which the decedent's 29 
estate is liable and the amount of estate tax for which the decedent's estate would 30 
have been liable if the property had not been included in the decedent's gross estate is 31 
apportioned ratably among the holders of interests in the property.  The balance of the 32 
tax, if any, is apportioned ratably to each other person having an interest in the 33 
apportionable estate; and  34 
D.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, paragr aph B, subparagraph (4) and 35 
except as to property to which subsection 7 applies, an estate tax apportioned to 36 
persons holding interests in property subject to a time -limited interest must be 37 
apportioned, without further apportionment, to the principal of t hat property.  38 
5.  Credits and deferrals.  Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, this 39 
subsection applies to credits and deferrals of estate taxes.  40 
 
 Page 157 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 A.  A credit resulting from the payment of gift taxes or from estate taxes paid on 1 
property pre viously taxed inures ratably to the benefit of all persons to whom the 2 
estate tax is apportioned.  3 
B.  A credit for state or foreign estate taxes inures ratably to the benefit of all persons 4 
to whom the estate tax is apportioned, except that the amount of a  credit for a state or 5 
foreign tax paid by a beneficiary of the property on which the state or foreign tax was 6 
imposed, directly or by a charge against the property, inures to the benefit of the 7 
beneficiary.  8 
C.  If payment of a portion of an estate tax is deferred because of the inclusion in the 9 
gross estate of a particular interest in property, the benefit of the deferral inures 10 
ratably to the persons to whom the estate tax attributable to the interest is 11 
apportioned.  The burden of any interest charges in curred on a deferral of taxes and 12 
the benefit of any tax deduction associated with the accrual or payment of the interest 13 
charge are allocated ratably among the persons receiving an interest in the property.  14 
6.  Insulated property; advancement of tax.  This subsection applies when the 15 
estate includes property that is unavailable for payment of estate tax due to impossibility 16 
or impracticability.  17 
A.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following 18 
terms have the following me anings.  19 
(1)  "Advanced fraction" means a fraction that has as its numerator the amount of 20 
the advanced tax and as its denominator the value of the interests in insulated 21 
property to which that tax is attributable.  22 
(2)  "Advanced tax" means the aggregate am ount of estate tax attributable to 23 
interests in insulated property that is required to be advanced by uninsulated 24 
holders under paragraph C.  25 
(3)  "Insulated property" means property subject to a time -limited interest that is 26 
included in the apportionable e state but is unavailable for payment of an estate 27 
tax because of impossibility or impracticability.  28 
(4)  "Uninsulated holder" means a person who has an interest in uninsulated 29 
property.  30 
(5)  "Uninsulated property" means property included in the apportionab le estate 31 
other than insulated property.  32 
B.  If an estate tax is to be advanced pursuant to paragraph C by persons holding 33 
interests in uninsulated property subject to a time -limited interest other than property 34 
to which subsection 7 applies, the tax must be advanced, without further 35 
apportionment, from the principal of the uninsulated property.  36 
C.  Subject to subsection 9, paragraphs B and D, an estate tax attributable to interests 37 
in insulated property must be advanced ratably by uninsulated holders.  If the value of 38 
an interest in uninsulated property is less than the amount of estate taxes otherwise 39 
required to be advanced by the holder of that interest, the deficiency must be 40 
advanced ratably by the persons holding interests in properties that are exclu ded from 41 
 
 Page 158 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the apportionable estate under subsection 2, paragraph A, subparagraph (2) as if those 1 
interests were in uninsulated property.  2 
D.  A court having jurisdiction to determine the apportionment of an estate tax may 3 
require a beneficiary of an interest  in insulated property to pay all or part of the estate 4 
tax otherwise apportioned to the interest if the court finds that it would be 5 
substantively more equitable for that beneficiary to bear the tax liability personally 6 
than for that part of the tax to be  advanced by uninsulated holders.  7 
E.  When a distribution of insulated property is made, each uninsulated holder may 8 
recover from the distributee a ratable portion of the advanced fraction of the property 9 
distributed.  To the extent that undistributed insu lated property ceases to be insulated, 10 
each uninsulated holder may recover from the property a ratable portion of the 11 
advanced fraction of the total undistributed property.  12 
F.  Upon a distribution of insulated property for which, pursuant to paragraph D, t he 13 
distributee becomes obligated to make a payment to uninsulated holders, a court may 14 
award an uninsulated holder a recordable lien on the distributee's property to secure 15 
the distributee's obligation to that uninsulated holder.  16 
7.  Apportionment and reca pture of special elective benefits.  The reduction in 17 
estate tax due to election of a special elective benefit must be apportioned in accordance 18 
with this subsection.  19 
A.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following 20 
terms have the following meanings.  21 
(1)  "Special elective benefit" means a reduction in an estate tax obtained by an 22 
election for:  23 
(a)  A reduced valuation of specified property that is included in the gross 24 
estate;  25 
(b)  A deduction from the gross estate, oth er than a marital or charitable 26 
deduction, allowed for specified property; or  27 
(c)  An exclusion from the gross estate of specified property.  28 
(2)  "Specified property" means property for which an election has been made for 29 
a special elective benefit.  30 
B.  If an election is made for one or more special elective benefits, an initial 31 
apportionment of a hypothetical estate tax must be computed as if no election for any 32 
of those benefits had been made.  The aggregate reduction in estate tax resulting from 33 
all elec tions made must be allocated among holders of interests in the specified 34 
property in the proportion that the amount of deduction, reduced valuation or 35 
exclusion attributable to each holder's interest bears to the aggregate amount of 36 
deductions, reduced val uations and exclusions obtained by the decedent's estate from 37 
the elections.  If the estate tax initially apportioned to the holder of an interest in 38 
specified property is reduced to zero, any excess amount of reduction reduces ratably 39 
the estate tax appor tioned to other persons that receive interests in the apportionable 40 
estate.  41 
 
 Page 159 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 C.  An additional estate tax imposed to recapture all or part of a special elective 1 
benefit must be charged to the persons that are liable for the additional tax under the 2 
law prov iding for the recapture.  3 
8.  Securing payment of estate tax from property in possession of fiduciary.  A 4 
fiduciary may ensure that a distributee will pay the distributee's share of the estate tax 5 
through one of the following methods.  6 
A.  A fiduciary may de fer a distribution of property until the fiduciary is satisfied that 7 
adequate provision for payment of the estate tax has been made.  8 
B.  A fiduciary may withhold from a distributee an amount equal to the amount of 9 
estate tax apportioned to an interest of t he distributee.  10 
C.  As a condition to a distribution, a fiduciary may require the distributee to provide 11 
a bond or other security for the portion of the estate tax apportioned to the distributee.  12 
9.  Collection of estate tax by fiduciary.  A fiduciary resp onsible for payment of an 13 
estate tax may collect the tax due using the following methods.  14 
A.  A fiduciary responsible for payment of an estate tax may collect from any person 15 
the tax apportioned to and the tax required to be advanced by the person.  16 
B.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, any estate tax due from a person 17 
that cannot be collected from the person may be collected by the fiduciary from other 18 
persons in the following order of priority:  19 
(1)  Any person having an interest in the apportio nable estate that is not 20 
exonerated from the tax;  21 
(2)  Any other person having an interest in the apportionable estate; and  22 
(3)  Any person having an interest in the gross estate.  23 
C.  A domiciliary fiduciary may recover from an ancillary personal represent ative the 24 
estate tax apportioned to the property controlled by the ancillary personal 25 
representative.  26 
D.  The total tax collected from a person pursuant to this section may not exceed the 27 
value of the person's interest.  28 
10.  Right of reimbursement.  A pers on may obtain reimbursement of estate tax as 29 
provided in this subsection.  30 
A.  A person required under subsection 9 to pay an estate tax greater than the amount 31 
due from the person under subsection 3 or 4 has a right to reimbursement from 32 
another person to the extent that the other person has not paid the tax required by 33 
subsection 3 or 4 and a right to reimbursement ratably from other persons to the 34 
extent that each has not contributed a portion of the amount collected under 35 
subsection 9, paragraph B.  36 
B.  A fiduciary may enforce the right of reimbursement under paragraph A on behalf 37 
of the person that is entitled to the reimbursement and shall take reasonable steps to 38 
do so if requested by the person.  39 
 
 Page 160 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 11.  Action to determine or enforce section.  A fiduciary , transferee or beneficiary 1 
of the gross estate may maintain an action for declaratory judgment to have a court 2 
determine and enforce this section.  3 
12.  Delayed application.  The applicability of subsections 3 to 7 is governed by this 4 
subsection.  5 
A.  Subse ctions 3 to 7 do not apply to the estate of a decedent who dies on or within 3 6 
years after January 1, 2019 nor to the estate of a decedent who dies more than 3 years 7 
after January 1, 2019 if the decedent continuously lacked testamentary capacity from 8 
the e xpiration of the 3 -year period until the date of death.  9 
B.  For the estate of a decedent who dies on or after January 1, 2019 to which 10 
subsections 3 to 7 do not apply, estate taxes must be apportioned pursuant to the law 11 
in effect immediately before Januar y 1, 2019.  12 
PART 10  13 
CLOSING ESTATES  14 
§3-1001.  Formal proceedings terminating administration; testate or intestate; order 15 
of general protection  16 
1.  Formal proceedings terminating administration.  A personal representative or 17 
any interested person may petitio n for an order of complete settlement of the estate.  The 18 
personal representative may petition at any time and any other interested person may 19 
petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative except 20 
that no petition unde r this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims 21 
that arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired.  The petition may request the 22 
court to determine testacy, if not previously determined, to consider the final account or 23 
compe l or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe any will or determine heirs 24 
and to adjudicate the final settlement and distribution of the estate.  After notice to all 25 
interested persons and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders on appro priate 26 
conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate and, as 27 
circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the 28 
estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or de mand of any 29 
interested person.  30 
2.  Omitted parties.  If one or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or 31 
were not given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, the court, on proper 32 
petition for an order of complete settlement of the es tate under this section, and after 33 
notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested parties determined to be 34 
interested on the assumption that the previous order concerning testacy is conclusive as to 35 
those given notice of the earlier proce eding, may determine testacy as it affects the 36 
omitted persons and confirm or alter the previous order of testacy as it affects all 37 
interested persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs.  In the absence of 38 
objection by an omitted or unnotified p erson, evidence received in the original testacy 39 
proceeding constitutes prima facie proof of due execution of any will previously admitted 40 
to probate or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings 41 
determined this fact.  42 
 
 Page 161 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-1002 .  Formal proceedings terminating testate administration; order construing 1 
will without adjudicating testacy  2 
A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will 3 
or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition f or an order of settlement 4 
of the estate that will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent.  The personal 5 
representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year, from 6 
the appointment of the original personal representat ive, except that no petition under this 7 
section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims that arose prior to the 8 
death of the decedent has expired.  The petition may request the court to consider the 9 
final account or compel or approve an acc ounting and distribution, to construe the will 10 
and to adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate.  After notice to all 11 
devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or 12 
orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the 13 
estate under the will and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or 14 
approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from 15 
further claim or demand  of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those the 16 
devisee represents.  If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings must 17 
be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of section 3 -1001.  18 
§3-1003.  Closing estat es; by sworn statement of personal representative  19 
1.  Closing estate by sworn statement of personal representative.  Unless 20 
prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered in supervised 21 
administration proceedings, a personal repr esentative may close an estate by filing with 22 
the court no earlier than 6 months after the date of original appointment of a general 23 
personal representative for the estate a verified statement stating that the personal 24 
representative, or a previous persona l representative, has:  25 
A.  Determined that the time limited for presentation of creditors' claims has expired;  26 
B.  Fully administered the estate of the decedent by making payment, settlement or 27 
other disposition of all claims that were presented, expenses of administration and 28 
estate, inheritance and other death taxes, except as specified in the statement, and that 29 
the assets of the estate have been distributed to the persons entitled.  If any claims 30 
remain undischarged, the statement must state whether the  personal representative 31 
has distributed the estate subject to possible liability with the agreement of the 32 
distributees or it shall state in detail other arrangements that have been made to 33 
accommodate outstanding liabilities; and  34 
C.  Sent a copy of the s tatement to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors or 35 
other claimants of whom the personal representative is aware whose claims are 36 
neither paid nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of the personal 37 
representative's administra tion to the distributees whose interests are affected thereby.  38 
2.  Termination of personal representative appointment.  If no proceedings 39 
involving the personal representative are pending in the court one year after the closing 40 
statement is filed, the appo intment of the personal representative terminates.  41 
 
 Page 162 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §3-1004.  Liability of distributees to claimants  1 
After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to section 3 -1006, an 2 
undischarged claim not barred may be prosecuted in a proceeding against on e or more 3 
distributees.  A distributee is not liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt 4 
property or homestead or family allowances or for amounts in excess of the value of the 5 
distribution as of the time of distribution.  As between distributees, each bears the cost of 6 
satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of 7 
administration.  Any distributee who fails to notify other distributees of the demand made 8 
by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the 9 
claim was asserted loses the right of contribution against other distributees.  10 
§3-1005.  Limitations on proceedings against personal representative  11 
Unless previously barred by adjudication and except as provided in the closin g 12 
statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose claims have not otherwise been 13 
barred against the personal representative for breach of fiduciary duty are barred unless a 14 
proceeding to assert those rights is commenced within 6 months after the  filing of the 15 
closing statement.  The rights barred by this section do not include rights to recover from 16 
a personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation or inadequate disclosure related to 17 
the settlement of the decedent's estate.  18 
§3-1006.  Limitat ions on actions and proceedings against distributees  19 
Unless previously adjudicated in a formal testacy proceeding or in a proceeding 20 
settling the accounts of a personal representative or otherwise barred, the claim of any 21 
claimant to recover from a distrib utee who is liable to pay the claim, and the right of an 22 
heir or devisee, or of a successor personal representative acting in the heir's or devisee's 23 
behalf, to recover property improperly distributed or its value from any distributee is 24 
forever barred at the later of 3 years after the decedent's death or one year after the time 25 
of its distribution, but all claims of creditors of the decedent are barred 9 months after the 26 
decedent's death.  This section does not bar an action to recover property or value 27 
received as the result of fraud.  28 
§3-1007.  Certificate discharging liens securing fiduciary performance  29 
After the personal representative's appointment has terminated, the personal 30 
representative, the personal representative's sureties or any successor of ei ther, upon the 31 
filing of a verified application showing, so far as is known by the applicant, that no action 32 
concerning the estate is pending in any court, is entitled to receive a certificate from the 33 
register that the personal representative appears to h ave fully administered the estate in 34 
question.  The certificate evidences discharge of any lien on any property given to secure 35 
the obligation of the personal representative in lieu of bond or any surety, but does not 36 
preclude action against the personal r epresentative or the surety.  37 
§3-1008.  Subsequent administration  38 
If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the 39 
personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been 40 
 
 Page 163 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 filed, the court  upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may 1 
appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently 2 
discovered estate.  If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the 3 
provis ions of this Code apply as appropriate, but no claim previously barred may be 4 
asserted in the subsequent administration.  5 
PART 11  6 
COMPROMISE OF CONTRO VERSIES  7 
§3-1101.  Effect of approval of agreements involving trusts, inalienable interests or 8 
interests of 3rd persons  9 
A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument 10 
offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity or effect of 11 
any governing instrument, the rights or interests in the estate of the de cedent, of any 12 
successor or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the 13 
court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties thereto including those unborn, 14 
unascertained or who could not be located.  An approved compromise  is binding even 15 
though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the 16 
rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.  17 
§3-1102.  Procedure for securing court approval of compromise  18 
The procedure f or securing court approval of a compromise is as follows.  19 
1.  Written, signed agreement.  The terms of the compromise must be set forth in an 20 
agreement in writing that must be executed by all competent persons and parents or legal 21 
guardians who have both a ctual custody and legal responsibility for a minor child acting 22 
for any minor child who has beneficial interests or claims that will or may be affected by 23 
the compromise.  Execution is not required by any person whose identity cannot be 24 
ascertained or whos e whereabouts are unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained.  25 
2.  Submission to court for approval.  Any interested person, including the personal 26 
representative or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its approval 27 
and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee of every affected 28 
testamentary trust and other fiduciaries and representatives.  29 
3.  Hearing and order.  After notice to all interested persons or their representatives, 30 
including the personal representative of th e estate and all affected trustees of trusts, the 31 
court, if it finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the 32 
agreement upon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other 33 
representatives is just and reasona ble, shall make an order approving the agreement and 34 
directing all fiduciaries subject to its jurisdiction to execute the agreement.  Minor 35 
children represented only by their parents are bound only if their parents join with other 36 
competent persons in exec ution of the compromise.  Upon the making of the order and 37 
the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate must be in accordance 38 
with the terms of the agreement.  39

1.  Verified statement; contents.  Unless prohibited by order of the court and except 2 
for estates being administered by supervis ed personal representatives, a personal 3 
representative may close an estate administered under the summary procedures of section 4 
3-1203 by filing with the court, at any time after disbursement and distribution of the 5 
estate, a verified statement stating tha t: 6 
A.  To the best knowledge of the personal representative, the value of the entire 7 
estate, less liens and encumbrances, did not exceed homestead allowance, exempt 8 
property, family allowance, costs and expenses of administration, reasonable funeral 9 
expens es and reasonable, necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness 10 
of the decedent;  11 
B.  The personal representative has fully administered the estate by disbursing and 12 
distributing it to the persons entitled thereto; and  13 
C.  The personal repres entative has sent a copy of the closing statement to all 14 
distributees of the estate and to all creditors or other claimants of whom the personal 15 
representative is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred and has furnished a 16 
full account in writing of  the administration to the distributees whose interests are 17 
affected.  18 
2.  Termination of personal representative appointment.  If no actions or 19 
proceedings involving the personal representative are pending in the court one year after 20 
the closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.  21 
3.  Effect of verified statement.  A closing statement filed under this section has the 22 
same effect as one filed under section 3 -1003.  23 
§3-1205.  Social security payments  24 
If not less than 30 days after the death of a Maine resident entitled at the time of the 25 
resident's death to a monthly benefit or benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 26 
all or part of the amount of such benefit or benefits not in excess of $1,000 is paid by th e 27 
United States to the surviving spouse, one or more of the decedent's children or 28 
descendants of the deceased children, the decedent's father or mother or the decedent's 29 
brother or sister, preference being given in the order named if more than one request  for 30 
payment has been made by or for such individuals, upon an affidavit made and filed with 31 
the federal Department of Health and Human Services by the surviving spouse or other 32 
relative by whom or on whose behalf request for payment is made; and if the af fidavit 33 
shows the date of death of the decedent, the relationship of the affiant to the decedent, 34 
that no personal representative for the decedent has been appointed and qualified and that, 35 
to the affiant's knowledge, there exists at the time of filing of the affidavit no relative of a 36 
closer degree of kindred to the decedent than the affiant, then such payment pursuant to 37 
the affidavit is deemed to be a payment to the legal representative of the decedent and, 38 
regardless of the truth or falsity of the state ments made in the affidavit, constitutes a full 39 
discharge and release of the United States from any further claim for such payment to the 40 
same extent as if such payment had been made to the personal representative of the 41 
decedent's estate.  42

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§3-203) 4 
 This section deviates from the Uniform Probate Code in subsections 1, 3 and 4.  In 5 
subsection 1, this section adds the decedent's dome stic partner and the State Tax Assessor as 6 
paragraphs E and H respectively in keeping with prior Maine law.  In subsection 3, this 7 
section does not include the uniform language that references "a person who would be 8 
entitled to letters but for the person's  age" and does not include the language in the next 9 
sentence that references a person "18 years of age or older."  The language is not needed in 10 
Maine because a person aged 18 or over may serve as a personal representative in Maine.  11 
The default age under the Uniform Probate Code requires that a person be at least 21 years 12 
old to serve as a personal representative.  Finally, in subsection 4, this section deviates from 13 
the Uniform Probate Code by adding the right of an agent under a power of attorney that  14 
expressly grants the agent the authority to do so,  to exercise the same right to nominate, to 15 
object to another's appointment or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in 16 
interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or war d would have if qualified for 17 
appointment.  18

executes a power of attorney unde r subsection 1 for the purpose of providing for the 16 
temporary care of a minor.  17 
A.  The execution of a power of attorney under subsection 1, without other evidence, 18

may not execute a power of attorney with the intention of permanently avoiding or 20 
divesting the parent or guardian of parental and legal responsibility for the care of the 21 
minor. Upon the expiration or termination of the power of attorney, the minor must 22

considered a family foster home by virtue of the parent's or guardian's execution of a 36 
power of attorney authorized by subsection 1 and is not subject to any laws regarding 37 
the licensure or regulation of family foster homes unless licensed as a family  foster 38 
home.  Nothing in this subsection disqualifies the agent from being or becoming a 39 
family foster home licensed by the State or prevents the placement of the minor in the 40 
agent's care if the minor enters state custody.  41

the county  of this State in which the minor resides or is present at the time the proceeding 3 
is commenced.  4 
2.  Guardianship for incapacitated person.  Venue for a guardianship proceeding 5

4.  Where first brought; exceptions.  If a proceeding under this Article is brought in 15 
more than one county in this  State, the court of the county in which the proceeding is first 16

proceeding be trans ferred.  19 
§5-108.  Letters of appointment  20 
Upon the guardian's filing of an acceptance of appointment, the court shall issue 21 
appropriate letters of guardianship.  Upon the conservator's filing of an acceptance of 22

§5-110.  Termination of or change in guardian's or conservator's appointment  34 
1.  Termination of appointment.  The appointment of a guardian or conservator 35

termination of t he guardianship or conservatorship.  A resignation of a guardian or 37 
conservator is effective when approved by the court.  A parental or spousal appointment 38 
as guardian under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate 39 
in a fo rmal proceeding. Termination of the appointment of a guardian or conservator does 40 
 
 Page 188 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 not affect the liability of either for previous acts or the obligation to account for money 1

vacancy occurs.  An additional or successor guardian or conservator may file an 13 
acceptance of appointment at any time after the appointment, but not later than 30 days 14 
after the occurrence of the vacancy or othe r designated event.  The additional or 15 
successor guardian or conservator becomes eligible to act on the occurrence of the 16 
vacancy or designated event, or the filing of the acceptance of appointment, whichever 17 
last occurs.  A successor guardian or conservat or succeeds to the predecessor's powers, 18

assets.  20 
4.  Court appointment of attorney for ward, guardian, petitioner.  If, at any time 21 
in the proceeding, the court deter mines that the interests of the ward are, or may be, 22 
inadequately represented, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the ward, giving 23 
consideration to the preference of the ward if the ward is 14 or more years of age.  In a 24 
contested action, the c ourt also may appoint counsel for any indigent guardian or 25 
petitioner.  26 
5.  Termination without consent, best interest; subsequent petitions.  The court 27 
may not terminate the guardianship in the absence of the guardian's consent unless the 28 
court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the termination is in the best interest 29 
of the ward.  The petitioner has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the 30 
evidence that termination of the guardianship is in the best interest of the ward.  If the 31 
court doe s not terminate the guardianship, the court may dismiss subsequent petitions for 32 
termination of the guardianship unless there has been a substantial change of 33 
circumstances.  34 
6.  Parent's petition to terminate guardianship; burden of proof.  A party 35 
opposin g a parent's petition to terminate a guardianship bears the burden of proving by a 36 
preponderance of the evidence that the parent seeking to terminate the guardianship is 37 
currently unfit to regain custody of the child.  If the party opposing termination of the 38 
guardianship fails to meet its burden of proof on the question of the parent's fitness to 39 
regain custody, the court shall terminate the guardianship and make any further order that 40 
may be appropriate.  41

determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate.  If not 17 
preclu ded by a conflict of interest, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent 18 
several individuals or interests.  The court shall state on the record the duties of the 19 
guardian ad litem and the court's reasons for the appointment.  20 
§5-114.  Request for no tice; interested persons  21 
An interested person not otherwise entitled to notice who desires to be notified before 22 
any order is made in a guardianship proceeding, including a proceeding after the 23

the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending.  The clerk shall send or deliver 25 
a copy of the request to the guardian and to the conservator if one has been appointed.  A 26

making it and the address of that person or an attorney to whom notice is to be given.  28 
The request is effective only as to proceedings conducted after its filing.  A governmental 29

 Page 190 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §5-201.  Appointment and status of guardian  1 
A person becomes a guardian of a minor by parental appointment or upon 2 
appointment by the court.  The guardianship status continues until termina ted, without 3 
regard to the location of the guardian or minor ward.  This section does not apply to 4 
permanency guardians appointed in District Court child protective proceedings under 5 
Title 22, section 4038 -C.  If a minor has a permanency guardian, the cour t may not 6 
appoint another guardian without leave of the District Court in which the child protective 7 
proceeding is pending.  8 
§5-202.  Parental appointment of guardian  9 
1.  Appointment by parent.  A guardian may be appointed by will or other signed 10 
writing by  a parent for any minor child the parent has or may have in the future.  The 11 
appointment may specify the desired limitations on the powers to be given to the 12 
guardian.  The appointing parent may revoke or amend the appointment before 13 
confirmation by the co urt. 14 
2.  Petition to confirm selection, terminate right to object.  Upon petition of an 15 
appointing parent and a finding that the appointing parent will likely become unable to 16 
care for the child within 2 years, and after notice as provided in section 5 -205, subsection 17 
1, the court, before the appointment becomes effective, may confirm the parent's selection 18 
of a guardian and terminate the rights of others to object.  19 
3.  Appointment effective.  Subject to section 5 -203, the appointment of a guardian 20 
becomes effective upon the appointing parent's death, an adjudication that the parent is an 21 
incapacitated person or a written determination by a physician who has examined the 22 
parent that the parent is no longer able to care for the child, whichever first occurs.  23 
4.  Acceptance of appointment.  The guardian becomes eligible to act upon the 24 
filing of an acceptance of appointment, which must be filed within 30 days after the 25 
guardian's appointment becomes effective.  The guardian shall:  26 
A.  File the acceptance of app ointment and a copy of the will with the court of the 27 
county in which the will was or could be probated or, in the case of another 28 
appointing instrument, file the acceptance of appointment and the appointing 29 
instrument with the court of the county in which  the minor resides or is present; and  30 
B.  Give written notice of the acceptance of appointment to the appointing parent, if 31 
living, the minor, if the minor has attained 14 years of age, and a person other than 32 
the parent having care and custody of the mino r. 33 
5.  Notice of right to object.  Unless the appointment was previously confirmed by 34 
the court, the notice given under subsection 4, paragraph B must include a statement of 35 
the right of those notified to terminate the appointment by filing a written objec tion in the 36 
court as provided in section 5 -203. 37 
6.  Petition to confirm appointment.  Unless the appointment was previously 38 
confirmed by the court, within 30 days after filing the notice and the appointing 39 
 
 Page 191 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 instrument, a guardian shall petition the court fo r confirmation of the appointment, giving 1 
notice in the manner provided in section 5 -205, subsection 1.  2 
7.  Parental rights not superseded; priority.  The appointment of a guardian by a 3 
parent does not supersede the parental rights of either parent.  If bo th parents are dead or 4 
have been adjudged incapacitated persons, an appointment by the last parent who died or 5 
was adjudged incapacitated has priority.  An appointment by a parent that is effected by 6 
filing the guardian's acceptance under a will probated i n the state of the testator's domicile 7 
is effective in this State.  8 
8.  Relation back of powers.  The powers of a guardian who timely complies with 9 
the requirements of subsections 4 and 6 relate back to give acts by the guardian that are of 10 
benefit to the m inor and occurred on or after the date the appointment became effective 11 
the same effect as those that occurred after the filing of the acceptance of the 12 
appointment.  13 
9.  Termination of authority.  The authority of a guardian appointed under this 14 
section te rminates upon the first to occur of the appointment of a guardian by the court or 15 
the giving of written notice to the guardian of the filing of an objection pursuant to 16 
section 5 -203. 17 
§5-203.  Objection by minor or others to parental appointment  18 
Until the court has confirmed an appointee under section 5 -202, a minor who is the 19 
subject of an appointment by a parent and who has attained 14 years of age, the other 20 
parent or a person other than a parent or guardian having care or custody of the minor 21 
may preven t or terminate the appointment at any time by filing a written objection in the 22 
court in which the appointing instrument is filed and giving notice of the objection to the 23 
guardian and any other persons entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointme nt.  24 
An objection may be withdrawn and if withdrawn is of no effect.  The objection does not 25 
preclude judicial appointment of the person selected by the parent.  The court may treat 26 
the filing of an objection as a petition for the appointment of an emergen cy or a 27 
temporary guardian under section 5 -204 and proceed accordingly.  28 
§5-204.  Judicial appointment of guardian; conditions for appointment  29 
1.  Petition.  A minor or a person interested in the welfare of a minor may petition for 30 
appointment of a guardian . 31 
2.  Appointment.  The court may appoint a guardian for a minor if the court finds the 32 
appointment is in the minor's best interest and finds:  33 
A.  That the parents consent;  34 
B.  That all parental rights have been terminated; or  35 
C.  By clear and convincing e vidence that the parents are unwilling or unable to 36 
exercise their parental rights.  37 
3.  Priority for appointment.  If a guardian is appointed by a parent pursuant to 38 
section 5 -202 and the appointment has not been prevented or terminated under section 39 
 
 Page 192 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 5-203, that appointee has priority for appointment.  However, the court may proceed with 1 
another appointment upon a finding that the appointee under section 5 -202 has failed to 2 
accept the appointment within 30 days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.  3 
4.  Temporary guardian.  If necessary, the court may appoint a temporary guardian, 4 
with the status of an ordinary guardian of a minor, but the authority of a temporary 5 
guardian may not last longer than 6 months, except as provided in subsection 5.  6 
Notice of  hearing on the petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian must be as 7 
provided under section 5 -111 and section 5 -205, except that the notice must be given at 8 
least 5 days before the hearing, and notice need not be given to any person whose addres s 9 
and present whereabouts are unknown and cannot be ascertained by due diligence.  Upon 10 
a showing of good cause, the court may waive service of the notice of hearing on any 11 
person, other than the minor, if the minor is at least 14 years of age.  12 
5.  Parent member of National Guard or Reserves.  If one of the parents of a 13 
minor is a member of the National Guard or the Reserves of the United States Armed 14 
Forces under an order to active duty for a period of more than 30 days, a temporary 15 
guardianship that would  otherwise expire is automatically extended until 30 days after the 16 
parent is no longer under that active duty order or until an order of the court so provides.  17 
This subsection applies only if the parent's service is in support of:  18 
A.  An operational miss ion for which members of the reserve components have been 19 
ordered to active duty without their consent; or  20 
B.  Forces activated during a period of war declared by the United States Congress or 21 
a period of national emergency declared by the President of the  United States or the 22 
United States Congress.  23 
6.  Appointment of counsel.  A nonconsenting parent whose parental rights have not 24 
been terminated is entitled to court -appointed legal counsel if indigent.  In a contested 25 
action, the court may also appoint co unsel for any indigent guardian or petitioner when a 26 
parent or legal custodian has counsel.  27 
7.  Child support.  In a proceeding on a petition for judicial appointment of a 28 
guardian, the court may order a parent to pay child support in accordance with Title  19-A, 29 
Part 3.  When the Department of Health and Human Services provides child support 30 
enforcement services, the Commissioner of Health and Human Services may designate 31 
employees of the department who are not attorneys to represent the department in court  if 32 
a hearing is held.  The commissioner shall ensure that appropriate training is provided to 33 
all employees who are designated to represent the department under this subsection.  34 
8.  Limited guardian.  If the court appoints a limited guardian, the court sh all 35 
specify the duties and powers of the guardian, as required in section 5 -108 and section 36 
5-206, and any parental rights and responsibilities retained by the parent of the minor.  37 
§5-205.  Judicial appointment of guardian; procedure  38 
1.  Petition; notice o f hearing.  After a petition for appointment of a guardian is 39 
filed, the court shall schedule a hearing, and the petitioner shall give notice of the time 40 
and place of the hearing, together with a copy of the petition, to:  41 
 
 Page 193 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 A.  The minor, if the minor has at tained 14 years of age and is not the petitioner;  1 
B.  Any person alleged to have had the primary care and custody of the minor during 2 
the 60 days before the filing of the petition;  3 
C.  Each living parent of the minor or, if there is none, the adult nearest  in kinship 4 
who can be found;  5 
D.  Any person nominated as guardian by the minor if the minor has attained 14 years 6 
of age;  7 
E.  Any appointee of a parent whose appointment has not been prevented or 8 
terminated under section 5 -203; and  9 
F.  Any guardian or con servator currently acting for the minor in this State or 10 
elsewhere.  11 
2.  Appointment; other disposition.  The court, after the hearing scheduled pursuant 12 
to subsection 1, shall make the appointment of a guardian if the court finds that a 13 
qualified person se eks appointment, venue is proper, the required notices have been 14 
given, the conditions of section 5 -204, subsection 2 have been met and the best interest of 15 
the minor will be served by the appointment.  In other cases, the court may dismiss the 16 
proceeding or make any other disposition of the matter that will serve the best interest of 17 
the minor.  18 
3.  Court -appointed attorney.  If the court determines at any stage of the 19 
proceeding, before or after appointment, that the interests of the minor are or may be 20 
inadequately represented, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving 21 
consideration to the choice of the minor if the minor has attained 14 years of age.  22

interest of the minor.  The court shall appoint a person or persons nominated by the 27 
minor, if the minor has attained 14 years of age, unless the court finds the appointment 28 
will be contrary to the best interest of the minor.  29 
2.  Limited powers of guardian or coguardian.  In the interest of developing self - 30 
reliance of a ward or for oth er good cause, the court, at the time of appointment or later, 31 
on the court's own motion or on motion of the minor or other interested person, may limit 32 
the powers of a guardian or coguardian otherwise granted by this Part and thereby create 33 
a limited guar dianship.  Following the same procedure, the court may grant additional 34 
powers or withdraw powers previously granted.  35

(3)  The court determines that there is good cause not to provide notice.  12 
E.  If, prior to filing the petition, the petitioner did not provide notice as required 13 
under this subsection, the petitioner must state  in the affidavit the reasons for not 14 
providing notice.  If notice has not been provided, the court shall make a 15

1.  A minor.  A minor, if the court determines that the minor owns money or property 23 
requiring management or protection that cannot otherwise be provided or has or may 24 
have business affairs t hat may be put at risk or prevented because of the minor's age, or 25 
that money is needed for support and education and that protection is necessary or 26 
desirable to obtain or provide money; or  27 
2.  Any individual.  Any individual, including a minor, if the co urt determines that, 28 
for reasons other than age:  29 
A.  By clear and convincing evidence, the individual is unable to manage property 30 
and business affairs because of an impairment in the ability to receive and evaluate 31

wasted or dissipated unless management is provided or money is needed for the 36 
support, care, education, health and welfare of the individual or of individuals who 37 
are entitled to the individual's support and that protection is necessary or des irable to 38

reasonably available appropriate technological assistance.  For the purposes of this 7 
subsection, voluntary written consent is valid only if the consent was obtained by a 8

 value of any real property that the fiduciary, by express limitation, lacks power to sell or 1

2.  Proceedings against surety.  A proceeding may not be brought against a surety 28 
on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred.  29 
§5-417.  Compensation and  expenses  30 
If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, a guardian, conservator, attorney 31 
for the respondent or attorney whose services resulted in a protective order or in an order 32 
beneficial to a protected person's estate or any other person appoin ted by the court is 33 
entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate.  Compensation may be paid and 34 
expenses reimbursed without court order.  If the court determines that the compensation 35 
is excessive or the expenses are inappropriate, the excessive or inappropriate amount 36 
must be repaid to the estate.  37 
The factors set forth in section 3 -721, subsection 2 must be considered in determining 38 
the reasonableness of compensation under this section.  39 
 
 Page 220 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §5-418.  General duties of conservator; plan  1 
1.  Fiduciary; sta ndard of care.  A conservator, in relation to powers conferred by 2 
this Part or implicit in the title acquired by virtue of the proceeding, is a fiduciary and 3 
shall observe the standards of care applicable to a trustee.  4 
2.  Only as necessitated by limitatio ns.  A conservator may exercise authority only 5 
as necessitated by the limitations of the protected person and, to the extent possible, shall 6 
encourage the protected person to participate in decisions, act in the protected person's 7 
own behalf and develop or  regain the ability to manage the protected person's estate and 8 
business affairs.  9 
3.  Plan for estate; develop and restore protected person's ability.  Within 60 days 10 
after appointment, a conservator shall file with the appointing court a plan for protecti ng, 11 
managing, expending and distributing the assets of the protected person's estate.  The plan 12 
must be based on the actual needs of the protected person and take into consideration the 13 
best interest of the protected person.  The conservator shall include in the plan steps to 14 
develop or restore the protected person's ability to manage the protected person's 15 
property, an estimate of the duration of the conservatorship and projections of expenses 16 
and resources.  17 
4.  Estate plan; will; other instrument of prote cted person.  In investing an estate, 18 
selecting assets of the estate for distribution and invoking powers of revocation or 19 
withdrawal available for the use and benefit of the protected person and exercisable by 20 
the conservator, a conservator shall take int o account any estate plan of the protected 21 
person known to the conservator and may examine the will and any other donative, 22 
nominative or other appointive instrument of the protected person.  23 
§5-419.  Inventory; records  24 
1.  Inventory.  Within 60 days after appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file 25 
with the appointing court a detailed inventory of the estate subject to the conservatorship, 26 
together with an oath or affirmation that the inventory is believed to be complete and 27 
accurate as far as informa tion permits.  The conservator shall provide a copy of the 28 
completed inventory to the protected person if the person can be located, has attained 14 29 
years of age and has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any 30 
parent or guardian with whom the protected person resides.  31 
2.  Records of administration.  A conservator shall keep records of the 32 
administration of the estate and make them available for examination on reasonable 33 
request of an interested person.  34 
3.  Penalty for failure to f ile inventory.  If a conservator fails without good cause to 35 
file an inventory, the court may require the conservator or the conservator's surety to pay 36 
to the protected person's estate a minimum of $100 and a maximum of the amount the 37 
court determines is just to compensate the estate for any damage resulting from the failure 38 
to file the inventory.  The payments required by this subsection are in addition to any 39 
other award or remedy available at law or in equity for fiduciary misconduct of the 40 
conservator.  41 
 
 Page 221 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §5-420.  Reports; appointment of visitor; monitoring  1 
1.  Reports; annual, intermediate, final.  A conservator shall report to the court for 2 
administration of the protected person's estate annually unless the court otherwise directs, 3 
upon resignation or re moval, upon termination of the conservatorship and at other times 4 
as the court directs.  An order, after notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate report of 5 
a conservator adjudicates liabilities concerning the matters adequately disclosed in the 6 
account ing.  An order, after notice and hearing, allowing a final report adjudicates all 7 
previously unsettled liabilities relating to the conservatorship.  8 
2.  Contents of report.  A report must state or contain:  9 
A.  A list of the assets of the estate under the co nservator's control and a list of the 10 
receipts, disbursements and distributions during the period for which the report is 11 
made;  12 
B.  A list of the services provided to the protected person; and  13 
C.  Any recommended changes in the plan for the conservatorship  as well as a 14 
recommendation as to the continued need for conservatorship and any recommended 15 
changes in the scope of the conservatorship.  16 
3.  Visitor.  The court may appoint a visitor to review a report or plan, interview the 17 
protected person or conservat or and make any other investigation the court directs.  In 18 
connection with a report, the court may order a conservator to submit the assets of the 19 
estate to an appropriate examination to be made in a manner the court directs.  20 
4.  Report as directed.  Notwi thstanding subsections 1 to 4, a private conservator 21 
appointed before January 2, 2008 is not required to submit reports pursuant to subsection 22 
1, but is only required to submit such periodic reports as may be directed in the order of 23 
appointment.  24 
5.  Penal ty for failure to file accounting.  If the conservator fails without good 25 
cause to file the accounting required by the court, the court may require the conservator 26 
or the conservator's surety to pay to the protected person's estate a minimum of $100 and 27 
a maximum of the amount the court determines is just to compensate the estate for any 28 
damage resulting from the failure to file the accounting.  The payments required by this 29 
subsection are in addition to any other award or remedy available at law or in equi ty for 30 
fiduciary misconduct of the conservator.  31 
§5-421.  Title by appointment  32 
1.  Appointment vests title to property.  The appointment of a conservator vests in 33 
the conservator as trustee title to all property of the protected person, or to the part there of 34 
specified in the order, held at the time of appointment or thereafter acquired.  An order 35 
vesting in the conservator title to only a part of the property of the protected person 36 
creates a conservatorship limited to assets specified in the order.  37 
2.  Evidence of vesting title.  Letters of conservatorship are evidence of vesting title 38 
to the protected person's assets in the conservator.  An order terminating a 39 
conservatorship transfers title to assets remaining subject to the conservatorship, 40 
 
 Page 222 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 including any  described in the order, to the formerly protected person or the protected 1 
person's successors.  2 
3.  Recording of letters and orders.  Subject to the requirements of other statutes 3 
governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land or other p roperty, letters 4 
of conservatorship and orders terminating conservatorships may be filed or recorded to 5 
give notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.  6 
4.  Appointment not transfer or alienation.  The appointment of a conservator is 7 
not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or 8 
state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust 9 
instrument imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by  the 10 
protected person of the protected person's rights or interest, but this section does not 11 
restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive 12 
instrument relating to a conservator.  13 
§5-422.  Protected person's interest i nalienable  14 
1.  Interest not transferable or assignable by protected person.  Except as 15 
otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, the interest of a protected person in property 16 
vested in a conservator is not transferable or assignable by the protected pers on.  An 17 
attempted transfer or assignment by the protected person, although ineffective to affect 18 
property rights, may give rise to a claim against the protected person for restitution or 19 
damages that, subject to presentation and allowance, may be satisfied  as provided in 20 
section 5 -429. 21 
2.  Property not subject to process against protected person.  Property vested in a 22 
conservator by appointment and the interest of the protected person in that property are 23 
not subject to levy, garnishment or similar process for claims against the protected person 24 
unless allowed under section 5 -429. 25 
3.  Tangible personal property transferred by protected person.  A person 26 
without knowledge of the conservatorship who in good faith and for security or 27 
substantially equivalent va lue receives delivery from a protected person of tangible 28 
personal property of a type normally transferred by delivery of possession is protected as 29 
if the protected person or transferee had valid title.  30 
4.  Protection of 3rd party.  A 3rd party who deals with the protected person with 31 
respect to property vested in a conservator is entitled to any protection provided in other 32 
law. 33 
§5-423.  Sale, encumbrance or other transaction involving conflict of interest  34 
Any transaction involving the conservatorship est ate that is affected by a substantial 35 
conflict between the conservator's fiduciary and personal interests is voidable unless the 36 
transaction is expressly authorized by the court after notice to interested persons.  A 37 
transaction affected by a substantial c onflict between personal and fiduciary interests 38 
includes any sale, encumbrance or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate 39 
entered into by the conservator, the spouse, descendant, agent or attorney of a conservator 40 
 
 Page 223 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 or a corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial 1 
interest.  2 
§5-424.  Protection of person dealing with conservator  3 
1.  Protection of 3rd persons.  A person who assists or deals with a conservator in 4 
good faith and for value in any transactio n other than one requiring a court order under 5 
section 5 -410 or 5 -411 is protected as though the conservator properly exercised the 6 
power.  That a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the 7 
person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, but 8 
restrictions on powers of conservators that are endorsed on letters as provided in section 9 
5-108 are effective as to 3rd persons.  A person who pays or delivers assets to a 10 
conservator is not responsible for th eir proper application.  11 
2.  Application of protection.  Protection provided by this section extends to any 12 
procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect that occurred in proceedings leading to the 13 
issuance of letters and is not a substitute for protecti on provided to persons assisting or 14 
dealing with a conservator by comparable provisions in other law relating to commercial 15 
transactions or to simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.  16 
§5-425.  Powers of conservator in administration  17 
1.  Powers; powers of trustee.  Except as otherwise qualified or limited by the court 18 
in its order of appointment and endorsed on the letters, a conservator has all of the powers 19 
granted in this section and any additional powers granted by law to a trustee in this Sta te. 20 
2.  Specific powers.  A conservator, acting reasonably and in an effort to accomplish 21 
the purpose of the appointment, and without further court authorization or confirmation, 22

§5-426.  Delegation  12 
1.  Not entire administration; performance of functions.  A conservator may not 13 
delegate to an agent or another conservator the en tire administration of the estate, but a 14

3.  Liability.  A conservator who complies with subsections 1 and 2 is not liable to 26 
the pro tected person or to the estate for the decisions or actions of the agent to whom a 27

 confirmation for the support, care, education, health and welfare of the protected person 1 
and individuals who are in fact dependent on the protected person, including the payment 2 
of child or spous al support, in accordance with the following rules.  3 
A.  A conservator shall consider recommendations relating to the appropriate 4 
standard of support, care, education, health and welfare for the protected person or an 5 
individual who is in fact dependent on the protected person made by a guardian, if 6 
any, and, if the protected person is a minor, the conservator shall consider 7 
recommendations made by a parent.  8 
B.  A conservator may not be surcharged for money paid to persons furnishing 9 
support, care, education  or benefit to a protected person or an individual who is in 10 
fact dependent on the protected person in accordance with the recommendations of a 11 
parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the 12 
parent or guardian derives pers onal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from 13 
any personal duty of support, or the recommendations are not in the best interest of 14 
the protected person.  15 
C.  In making distributions under this subsection, the conservator shall consider:  16 
(1)  The s ize of the estate, the estimated duration of the conservatorship and the 17 
likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully self - 18 
sufficient and able to manage business affairs and the estate;  19 
(2)  The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and individuals 20

person, in cluding the protected person, as reimbursement for expenditures that the 24 
conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the 25 
protected person if it is reasonable to expect the services will be performed and 26 
advance payments are cu stomary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.  27 
2.  Gifts not to exceed 20% of annual income.  If the estate is ample to provide for 28 
the distributions authorized by subsection 1, a conservator for a protected person other 29 
than a minor may make gif ts that the protected person might have been expected to make, 30 
in amounts that do not exceed in the aggregate for any calendar year 20% of the income 31 
of the estate in that year.  32 
§5-428.  Death of protected person  33 
1.  Will; inform personal representative or  beneficiary; retain estate.  If a 34 
protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will 35

estate for delivery to the personal representative of the decedent or to another person 38 
entitled to it.  39 
2.  Apply to exercise powers and duties of personal representative; notice.  If a 40 
personal representative  has not been appointed within 40 days after the death of a 41 
 
 Page 227 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 protected person and an application or petition for appointment is not before the court, the 1 
conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative in 2 
order to admini ster and distribute the decedent's estate.  Upon application for an order 3 
conferring upon the conservator the powers of a personal representative, after notice 4 
given by the conservator to the following, the court may grant the application upon 5 
determining that there is no objection and endorse the letters of conservatorship to note 6

the powers and duties of a personal representative:  8 
A.  Any person nominated as person al representative by any will of which the 9 
applicant is aware;  10 
B.  All of the decedent's heirs; and  11 
C.  All devisees of the will, if any.  12 
3.  Effect of appointment as personal representative.  The issuance of an order 13 
under this section has the effect of a n order of appointment of a personal representative as 14 
provided in section 3 -308 and Article 3, Parts 6 to 10.  However, the estate in the name of 15 
the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors 16 
without retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.  17 
§5-429.  Presentation and allowance of claims  18 
1.  Claims against estate or protected person.  A conservator may pay, or secure by 19 
encumbering assets of the estate, claims against the estate or against the protect ed person 20

clerk of court and sending or delivering a copy of the statement to the  conservator.  26 
2.  Presented claim; allowance; disallowance.  A claim is considered presented on 27 
receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator or the filing of the claim with 28 
the court, whichever first occurs.  A presented claim is allowed if  it is not disallowed by 29 
written statement sent or delivered by the conservator to the claimant within 60 days after 30 
its presentation.  The conservator before payment may change an allowance to a 31 
disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance un der a court order or judgment 32 
or an order directing payment of the claim.  The presentation of a claim tolls the running 33

3.  Unpaid claim.  A claimant whose claim has  not been paid may petition the court 35 
for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of limitations 36 
and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance, payment or security by 37 
encumbering assets of the estate.  If a proceed ing is pending against a protected person at 38 
the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person 39 
thereafter, the moving party shall give to the conservator notice of any proceeding that 40 
could result in creating a claim aga inst the estate.  41 
 
 Page 228 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 4.  Distribution; order.  If it appears that the estate is likely to be exhausted before 1 
all existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind 2 
in payment of claims in the following order:  3 
A.  Costs a nd expenses of administration;  4 
B.  Claims of the Federal Government or State Government having priority under 5 
other law;  6 
C.  Claims incurred by the conservator for support, care, education, health and 7 
welfare previously provided to the protected person or individuals who are in fact 8 
dependent on the protected person;  9 
D.  Claims arising before the conservatorship; and  10 
E.  Any claims other than those specified in paragraphs A to D.  11 
5.  Preference of claims.  Preference may not be given in the payment of a cla im 12 
over any other claim of the same class, and a claim due and payable may not be preferred 13 
over a claim not due.  14 
6.  Security interest in conservatorship estate.  If assets of the conservatorship are 15 
adequate to meet all existing claims, the court, acting  in the best interest of the protected 16 
person, may order the conservator to grant a security interest in the conservatorship estate 17 
for payment of all claims at a future date.  18 
§5-430.  Personal liability of conservator  19 
1.  Not personally liable.  Except as  otherwise agreed, a conservator is not 20

of administration of the estate unless the conservator fails to reveal in the contract the 22 
representative capacity and ident ify the estate.  23 
2.  Personally liable.  A conservator is personally liable for obligations arising from 24 
ownership or control of property of the estate or for other acts or omissions occurring in 25 
the course of administration of the estate, including liabili ty for violation of 26 
environmental law, only if personally at fault.  27 
3.  Claims asserted against conservator.  Claims based on contracts entered into by 28 
a conservator in a fiduciary capacity, obligations arising from ownership or control of the 29 
estate and c laims based on torts committed in the course of administration of the estate 30 
may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary 31 
capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable therefor.  32 
4.  Determination o f liability.  A question of liability between the estate and the 33 
conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge or 34 
indemnification or in another appropriate proceeding or action.  35 
§5-431.  Termination of proceedings  36

 Page 229 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 court.  Unless created for reasons other than that the protected person is a minor, a 1 
conservatorship created for a minor also terminates when the protected person attains 2 
majority or is emancipated.  3 
2.  Distribution upon death; report and petition for discharge.  Upon the death of 4 
a protected person, the conservator shall conclude the administration of th e estate by 5 
distribution to the person's successors.  The conservator shall file a final report and 6 
petition for discharge within 30 days after distribution.  7 
3.  Petition to terminate; termination; liability.  On petition of a protected person, 8 
a conservat or or another person interested in a protected person's welfare, the court may 9 
terminate the conservatorship if the protected person no longer needs the assistance or 10 
protection of a conservator.  Termination of the conservatorship does not affect a 11 
conser vator's liability for previous acts or the obligation to account for funds and assets of 12 
the protected person.  13 
4.  Procedures for termination.  Except as otherwise ordered by the court for good 14 
cause, before terminating a conservatorship the court shall fo llow the same procedures to 15 
safeguard the rights of the protected person that apply to a petition for conservatorship.  16 
Upon the establishment of a prima facie case for termination, the court shall order 17 
termination unless it is proved that continuation of  the conservatorship is in the best 18 
interest of the protected person.  19 
5.  Title to assets passes upon termination; final report. Upon termination of a 20 
conservatorship and whether or not formally distributed by the conservator, title to assets 21 
of the estate  passes to the formerly protected person or the person's successors.  The order 22 
of termination must provide for expenses of administration and direct the conservator to 23 
execute appropriate instruments to evidence the transfer of title or confirm a distribu tion 24 
previously made and to file a final report and a petition for discharge upon approval of 25 
the final report.  26 
6.  Final order of discharge.  The court shall enter a final order of discharge upon 27

placed by the court on the conservator's discharge.  29

ADVANCE  HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE  34 
 
Explanation  35 
 
 Page 247 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 You have the right to give instructions about your own health care.  You also have 1 
the right to name someone else to make health care decisions for you.  This form lets you 2 
do either or both of these things.  It also let s you express your wishes regarding donation 3 
of organs and the designation of your primary physician.  If you use this form, you may 4 
complete or modify all or any part of it.  You are free to use a different form.  5 
Part 1 of this form is a power of attorney  for health care.  Part 1 lets you name 6 
another individual as agent to make health care decisions for you if you become incapable 7 
of making your own decisions or if you want someone else to make those decisions for 8 
you now even though you are still capable .  You may also name an alternate agent to act 9 
for you if your first choice is not willing, able or reasonably available to make decisions 10 
for you.  Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator or employee of 11 
a residential long -term heal th care institution at which you are receiving care.  12 
Unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent, your agent may make all 13 
health care decisions for you.  This form has a place for you to limit the authority of your 14 
agent.  You need not limi t the authority of your agent if you wish to rely on your agent 15 
for all health care decisions that may have to be made.  If you choose not to limit the 16 
authority of your agent, your agent will have the right to:  17 
(1)  Consent or refuse consent to any care, treatment, service or procedure to 18 
maintain, diagnose or otherwise affect a physical or mental condition;  19

§5-706.  Decisions by surrogate  2 
1.  Decisions by surrogate.  A surrogate may make a decision to withhold or 3 
withdraw life -sustaining treatment for a patient who is an adult or emancip ated minor if 4 
the patient has been determined by the primary physician to lack capacity, no agent or 5 
guardian has been appointed or the agent or guardian is not reasonably available and the 6 
patient is in a terminal condition or a persistent vegetative stat e as determined by the 7 
primary physician.  8 
A surrogate also is authorized to make any other health care decision for a patient who is 9 
an adult or emancipated minor if the patient has been determined by the primary 10 
physician to lack capacity and no agent or guardian exists, except that a surrogate may 11 
not deny surgery, procedures or other interventions that are lifesaving and medically 12 
necessary.  13 
A medically necessary procedure is one providing the most patient -appropriate 14 
intervention or procedure that can b e safely and effectively given.  15 
2.  Priority of who may act as surrogate.  Any member of the following classes of 16 
the patient's family who is reasonably available, in descending order of priority, may act 17 
as surrogate:  18 
A.  The spouse, unless legally separa ted; 19 
B.  An adult who shares an emotional, physical and financial relationship with the 20 
patient similar to that of a spouse;  21 
C.  An adult child;  22 
D.  A parent;  23 
E.  An adult brother or sister;  24 
F.  An adult grandchild;  25 
G.  An adult niece or nephew, related by  blood or adoption;  26 
H.  An adult aunt or uncle, related by blood or adoption; or  27 
I.  Any adult relative of the patient, related by blood or adoption, who is familiar with 28 
the patient's personal values and is reasonably available for consultation.  29 
3.  Adult  who has exhibited special concern.  If none of the individuals eligible to 30 
act as surrogate under subsection 2 is reasonably available, an adult who has exhibited 31 
special concern for the patient, who is familiar with the patient's personal values and who 32 
is reasonably available may act as surrogate.  33 
4.  Communication of assumption of authority.  A surrogate shall communicate the 34 
surrogate's assumption of authority as promptly as practicable to the members of the 35 
patient's family specified in subsection 2 w ho can be readily contacted.  36 
5.  Conflict among potential surrogates; neutral 3rd party or court.  If more than 37 
one member of a class assumes authority to act as surrogate and they, or members of 38 
 
 Page 254 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 different classes who are reasonably available, do not agree  on a health care decision and 1 
the supervising health care provider is so informed, the supervising health care provider 2 
may comply with the decision of the class having priority or a majority of the members of 3 
that class who have communicated their views to the provider.  The health care provider 4 
may refer the members of the class or classes to a neutral 3rd party for assistance in 5 
resolving the dispute or to a court of competent jurisdiction.  If the class is evenly divided 6 
concerning the health care deci sion and the supervising health care provider is so 7 
informed, that class and all individuals having lower priority are disqualified from 8 
making the decision.  9 
6.  Decision in accordance with instructions, wishes, best interest.  A surrogate 10 
shall make a hea lth care decision in accordance with the patient's individual instructions, 11 
if any, and other wishes to the extent known to the surrogate.  Otherwise, the surrogate 12 
shall make the decision in accordance with the surrogate's determination of the patient's 13 
best interest and in good faith.  In determining the patient's best interest, the surrogate 14 
shall consider the patient's personal values to the extent known to the surrogate.  A 15 
consent is not valid if it conflicts with the intention of the patient previous ly expressed to 16 
the surrogate.  17 
7.  Effective without judicial approval.  A health care decision made by a surrogate 18 
for a patient lacking capacity is effective without judicial approval.  19 
8.  Disqualification.  An individual with capacity at any time may di squalify another, 20 
including a member of the individual's family, from acting as the individual's surrogate 21 
by a signed writing or by personally informing the supervising health care provider of the 22 
disqualification.  23 
9.  Conflict of interest.  A surrogate m ay not be an owner, operator or employee of a 24 
residential long -term health care institution at which the patient is receiving care unless 25 
the surrogate is one of the following:  26 
A.  The spouse of the patient;  27 
B.  An adult child of the patient;  28 
C.  A parent of the patient; or  29 
D.  A relative of the patient with whom the patient has resided for more than 6 30 
months prior to the decision.  31 
10.  Written declaration supporting authority.  A supervising health care provider 32 
may require an individual claiming the right  to act as surrogate for a patient to provide a 33 
written declaration under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably 34 
sufficient to establish the claimed authority.  35 
§5-707.  Decisions by guardian  36 
1.  Compliance with expressed wishes; cann ot revoke advance health care 37 
directive.  Except as authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction, a guardian shall 38 
comply with the ward's individual instructions and other wishes, if any, expressed while 39 
 
 Page 255 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the ward had capacity and to the extent known to the guardian and may not revoke the 1 
ward's advance health care directive unless the appointing court expressly so authorizes.  2 
2.  Agent's decision takes precedence.  Absent a court order to the contrary, a health 3 
care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of a guardian.  4 
3.  Effective without judicial approval; exceptions.  A health care decision made 5 
by a guardian for the ward is effective without judicial approval, except under the 6 
following circumstances:  7 
A.  The guardian's decision is contrary to the ward's individual instructions and other 8 
wishes, expressed while the ward had capacity; or  9 
B.  The guardian seeks to withhold or withdraw life -sustaining treatment from the 10 
ward, against the advice of the ward's primary physician and in the absence of 11 
instructions from the ward, made while the ward had capacity.  12

2.  Include in record advance health care directive, surrogate, revocation, 17 
disqualification.  A supervising health care provider who knows of the ex istence of an 18

directive shall promptly record the determination in the patient's health car e record and 27 
communicate the determination to the patient, if possible, and to any person then 28 
authorized to make health care decisions for the patient.  29

health care insti tution providing care to a patient shall:  31

patient refuses assistance, immediately make all reasonable efforts to assist in the 20 
transfer of the patient to another health care provider or institution that is will ing to 21 
comply with the instruction or decision.  22 
8.  Not as a condition for providing health care.  A health care provider or health 23

MISCELLANEOUS PROVIS IONS  18 
§5-861.  Uniformity of application and construction  19 
In applying and construing this Part, consideration must be given to the need to 20 
promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among the states that 21 
enact it.  22 
§5-862.  Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act  23 
This Part modifies, limits and supersedes the federal Elect ronic Signatures in Global 24 
and National Commerce Act, 15 United States Code, Section 7001 et seq., but does not 25 
modify, limit or supersede 15 United States Code, Section 7001(c) or authorize electronic 26 
delivery of any of the notices described in 15 United States Code, Section 7003(b).  27 
§5-863.  Effect on existing powers of attorney  28 
Except as otherwise provided in this Part:  29 
1.  Application to powers of attorney.  This Part applies to a power of attorney 30 
created before, on or after January 1, 2019;  31 ................... ........................................  .........................  
Agent's Signature  Date  
 
 Page 286 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 2.  Applic ation to judicial proceedings commenced on or after January 1, 2019.  1 
This Part applies to a judicial proceeding concerning a power of attorney commenced on 2 
or after January 1, 2019; and  3 
3.  Application to judicial proceedings commenced before January 1, 2 019.  This 4 
Part applies to a judicial proceeding concerning a power of attorney commenced before 5 
January 1, 2019, unless the court finds that application of a provision of this Part would 6 
substantially interfere with the effective conduct of the judicial p roceeding or prejudice 7 
the rights of a party, in which case that provision does not apply and the superseded law 8 
applies.  9 
An act done before January 1, 2019 is not affected by this Part.  10 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -102) 11 
This section modifies  the Uniform Probate Code definition of " incapacitated person " 12 
by inserting  "informed" before "decisions."  Lack of capacity to make an "informed" 13 
decision is a statutory condition for involuntary treatment in a psychiatric hospital.  14 
"Informed" consent to tre atment is a term used in other health care contexts.  This change 15 
to the uniform language promotes consistency across Maine statutes related to capacity to 16 
decide or consent.  17 
Also in that definition, this section inserts  "reasonably available" before 18 
"tech nological assistance."  If technological assistance exists to address functional 19 
deficits, a guardianship or conservatorship is , arguably,  not "least restrictive."  According 20 
to the Uniform Probate Code language, if the respondent cannot afford technologic al 21 
assistance and if the assistance is not otherwise available, the respondent is precluded 22 
from getting either technological assistance or the protection that guardianship or 23 
conservatorship would provide.  24 
"Best interest of the minor" is not defined  in the Uniform Probate Code.  This section  25 
retains a definition of "best interest of the minor"  using currently existing criteria in Title 26 
19-A to promote uniformity across Maine statutes.  27 
The Uniform Probate Code does not include definitions of "de facto guard ian" and 28 
"demonstrated lack of consistent participation," which were both added to former Title 29 
18-A by Public Law 2005, chapter 371, which provided rights to adults who were caring 30 
for minors, but not under court appointment.  This section does not retain  those 31 
definitions. The Uniform Probate Code treatment of individuals  "other than a parent or 32 
guardian having care or custody of a minor" provides those individuals notice of 33 
guardianship proceedings, opportunity to object and potential guardianship appoin tment.  34 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -103) 35 
This section is based on section 5 -104 of the Uniform Probate Code.   36 
 
 Page 287 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 The Uniform Probate Code is adopted with a single change to allow transfer of funds 1 
under this provision to a married minor.  This is c onsistent with other statutes treating 2 
married minors as adults, such as Title 22, section 1503, which gives married minors 3 
authority to give consent for health care services.  With the exception of an increase over 4 
the amount in the former Title 18 -A of the permitted transfer amount from $5,000 to 5 
$10,000, this does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  6 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -104) 7 
This section is based on section 5 -105 of the Uniform Probate Code.   8 
This section  adopts the Unifo rm Probate Code with 2 exceptions.  First, this section  9 
uses a 12 -month effective period for a power of attorney rather than the 6 -month period 10 
in the Uniform Probate Code.  Second, this section  provides for an automatic extension 11 
for parents serving in th e National Guard or Reserves of the United States Armed Forces .  12 
In adopting  the Uniform Probate Code , this section removes the requirement under 13 
former Title 18 -A that a delegation by a court -appointed guardian through a power of 14 
attorney be filed with th e court.  15 
Also, Public Law 2015, chapter 467 added a new subsection 3 to address a power of 16 
attorney executed by parents for temporary care of a minor, addressing concerns about 17 
organizations providing agents to provide care for the minor pursuant to the po wer of 18 
attorney.  19 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -105) 20 
This section is based on section 5 -106 of the Uniform Probate Code.   21 
This section  adopts the Uniform Probate Code language concerning jurisdiction.  22 
This does not change the Probate Court's role  as the exclusive court in Maine with 23 
jurisdiction over guardianship and protective proceedings for minors and adults, except as 24 
that jurisdiction may be reserved specifically to another court.  The Uniform Adult 25 
Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Jur isdiction Act is Part 5 of this Article.  26 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -108) 27 
This section is based on section 5 -110 of the Uniform Probate Code.   28 
This section expands previous Maine law by stating content requirements for letters 29 
of appointment.  30 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -109) 31 
This section is based on section 5 -111 of the Uniform Probate Code.   32 
This section  does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  33

 Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -110) 1 
This section is based on sectio n 5-112 of the Uniform Probate Code.   2 
This section adds to Maine law explicit authority to appoint contingent coguardians 3 
or successor guardians or conservators.  The section preserves the court's discretion t o 4 
appoint counsel for the ward or  indigent par ents or guardians or to "make any order that 5 
may be appropriate" as provided under the former Title 18 -A, section 5-212.  The section 6 
confirms Maine law  as interpreted by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in In re 7 
Guardianship of David C. , 2010 ME 136, ¶¶ 6 -7 and In re Guardianship of Jeremiah T. , 8 
2009 ME 74, ¶¶ 24 -28. 9 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -111) 10 
This section is based on section 5 -113 of the Uniform Probate Code.   11 
This section adds a plain language requirement to Maine law and specifies that  the 12 
petitioner must give the required notices.  13 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -112) 14 
This section is based on section 5 -114 of the Uniform Probate Code.   15 
This section removes the authority under former Title 18 -A, section 5 -309, subsection 16 
(b) and section 5 -405, subsection (a) for a ward or protected person to waive notice if that 17 
individual attended the hearing  or if the waiver was confirmed by that individual's  18 
counsel, the guardian ad litem or the visitor.  19 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -113) 20 
This section is based on section 5 -115 of the Uniform Probate Code.   21 
This section does not include  the specific requirements of former Title 18 -A, sections 22 
1-112, 5 -303 and 5 -407 addressing appointment and duties of guardians ad litem in 23 
guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.  This section consolidates the appointment 24 
sections and retains  the court 's discretion and a duty to tailor the role of the guardian ad 25 
litem to the circumstances.  26 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -114) 27 
This section is  based on section 5 -116 of the Uniform Probate Code.   28 
This section expands former Title 18 -A by allowing an individual not otherwise 29 
entitled to notice to receive notice in a guardianship or a conservatorship proceeding, as 30 
long as the individual has prov ided a statement showing the individual's interest and an 31 
address to which notice should be sent.  32 
 
 Page 289 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-201) 1 
Title 22, section 4038 -C permits District Courts in child protective proceedings to 2 
appoint a permanency guardian.   This section  departs from the Uniform Probate Code to 3 
recognize that authority and to ensure that the Probate Court does not appoint a guardian 4 
without leave of the District Court if the District Court has appointed a permanency 5 
guardian.  6 
Maine Uniform P robate Code Comment (§ 5-202) 7 
The Uniform Probate Code provisions permitting parental appointment of a so -called 8 
standby guardian are new to Maine law.  9 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-204) 10 
This section  does not adopt the temporary and emergency guard ianship language of 11 
the Uniform Probate Code.  The existing process in Maine, including authority to issue 12 
orders for transitional arrangements, accommodates prompt disposition and appropriate 13 
protections for participants in the context of Maine's part -time probate courts.  This 14 
section  retains the "clear and convincing evidence" burden of proof.  This section  also 15 
retains additional protections, previously codified in the last 3 paragraphs of former  Title 16 
18-A, section 5 -204, subsection (d), which are now contained in  section 5-204, 17 
subsections 6, 7 and 8, concerning legal representation for indigent parents, concerning 18 
cost-effective participation of child support enforcement agents in guardianship 19 
proceedings and specifying any parental rights retained if  a limited guardian is appointed.  20 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-205) 21 
This section expands the list of people entitled to notice of a guardianship petition but 22 
otherwise does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  23 
Maine Uniform Probate C ode Comment (§ 5-206) 24 
This section adds as a specific criterion for limiting the powers of a guardian  that the 25 
limitation must be  in the interest of developing self -reliance of a ward, consistent with the 26 
adult guardianship statute.  This section does not i nclude  the provision  under previous 27 
Maine law prohibiting the appointment of  a guardian who intends to remove the minor 28 
from the State for purposes of adoption, leaving the decision as to the minor's best interest 29 
in the discretion of the court.  30 
Maine Unif orm Probate Code Comment (§ 5-207) 31 
This section expands the duties of a guardian under previous Maine law, requiring the 32 
guardian to become and remain acquainted with a ward and to inform the court of a 33 
change in the ward's address, but this section does no t otherwise constitute a substantive 34 
change to Maine law.  35

The Uniform  Probate Code has no provision concerning transitional arrangements for 12

a health care provider, which is consistent with former Title 18 -A, section 5 -303, 31

This section adopts  Uniform Probate Code language modified to grant the cour t 6 
specific authority to order the examination required under section 5 -304, subsection 4 and 7 
to treat  the costs of evaluation in the same manner  as the costs of a visitor, a guardian ad 8 
litem and a court -appointed attorney were treated under former Title 1 8-A, section 5 -303, 9 
subsection (b).  10 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-307) 11 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A.  This section adopts  12 
Uniform Probate Code language modified to provide a respondent with an opportunity to 13

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-310) 24 
This section adopts  Uniform Probate Code language modified to treat domestic 25 
partners in a manner comparable to their treatment elsewhere in the Maine Uniform 26 
Probate Code.  27 
Former Title 18 -A, section 5 -311, subsection (b), paragraph (5) gave priority to a 28 
relative with whom the respondent has res ided.  Adoption of the Uniform Probate Code 29 
gives priority to an adult with whom the respondent has resided.  This section carries 30 
forward from the former Title 18 -A, section 5 -311, subsection (b), paragraph (6) 31 
consideration, as a last priority for guardi anship, of a person nominated by someone who 32 
is caring for the respondent or is paying benefits to the respondent.  33

See Maine Un iform Probate Code Comment section 5 -102. 2 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-312) 3 
This section adopts the Uniform Probate Code in part, but retains the role under 4 
former Title 18 -A, section 5 -310-A of the visitor and guardian ad litem in cases of 5 
emergency guardianships.  Given the nature of the probate courts in Maine, it is not 6 
pract ical to require the assignment of a lawyer immediately upon the receipt of a pet ition 7 
for an emergency guardian  or to adopt the shortened time limits contained in the Uniform 8 
Probate Code.  Partly for that reason, this section  continues to require the fili ng, with the 9 
petition for emergency guardianship, of an affidavit  setting forth the factual basis for the 10 
emergency and the powers requested, as in former Title 18 -A, section 5 -310-A.  The role 11 
of the guardian ad litem and visitor will continue to ensure t hat the respondent' s interests 12 
are represented  without limiting the court's authority to appoint a lawyer for the 13 
respondent at a later time on a case -by-case basis.  14 
This section carries forward from the former Title 18 -A, section 5 -310-A a 15 
heightened stan dard of harm as a basis for an ex parte appointment.  16 
Instead of adopting the shorter time limits contained in the Uniform Probate Code, 17 
this section integrates provisions of the former Title 18 -A, section 5 -310-A providing that 18 
emergency appointment of an  emergency guardian  be followed by a visit with a guardian 19 
ad litem or visitor.  20 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-313) 21 
This section retains as a nonuniform provision the provisions of former Title 18 -A, 22 
section 5 -310-A prohibiting a temporary substitu te guardian from seeking involuntary 23 
hospitalization of a ward outside the State.  24 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-315) 25 
This section adopts  Uniform Probate Code language modified to reconcile it with the 26 
Uniform Health Care Decisions Act, section 5 -707, which limits certain health ca re 27 
decision making  by a guardian.  This section also adopts Uniform Probate Code language 28 
modified to  ensure that people who rely on a coguardian's authority to act may rely on the 29 
consent or action of each coguardian sepa rately.  30 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§5 -316) 31 
This section uses the term  "psychiatric hospital ," as opposed to "mental health -care 32 
institution ," to conform to Title 34 -B, section 3863, which addresses involuntary civil 33 
commitment.  34

that continuing guardianship is in the best interest of the ward, once a prima faci e case for 10 
termination has been made.  11 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-401) 12 
This section adds to the Uniform Probate Code language about communicating 13

additions to  section 5 -102 (see accompanying Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment) . 15 
This section adds to subsection 2 of the Uniform Probate Code language a blocked 16 
paragraph that retains  the exception to the clear and convincing standard under Title 17 
18-A, section 5 -401, subsection (2) for a conservatorship to which an allegedly 18 
incapacitated adult has consented.  19

This section  does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  21 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-403) 22 
In conjunction with section 5-404, this section adds to Maine law the requirement  23 
that notice of a protective proceeding be given to an adult friend if any can be found and 24 
if no family can be found.  This is similar to the requirement of former Title 18 -A, se ction 25 
5-405, subsection (a -1). 26 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-404) 27 
This section adds to the language of the Uniform Probate Code language from former  28 
Title 18 -A, section 5 -418 limiting obligations to provide notice of filing of inventories, 29

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-408) 12 
This section adopts  Uniform Probate Code language modified to require the 13 
respondent's attenda nce only in contested proceedings, to eliminate the requirement that 14

participation in hearings, in keeping with the practice in most of Maine's probate courts.  16

section 5 -408, subsection (6), paragraph (b), as enacted by Public Law 2005, chapter 12, 21 
Part DDD, section 4 and  amended by Public Law 2011, chapter 155, section 1 , 22

section 5 -410 for consideration as conservator.  The spousal priority now applies to same - 33 
 
 Page 295 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 sex couples, and a person who has chosen not to marry may be considered later in the 1 
priority list as "an adult with whom the respondent has resided for mor e than 6 months."  2 
Although this section does not address  it, the court may order the conservator to 3 
notify the court of any change of address.  4 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-415) 5 
This section retains  statutory exceptions to bonding requirements fou nd in former 6

inventory to a prot ected person  who can be located, is 14 years of age or older and is 15 
capable of understanding;  by adopting Uniform Probate C ode section 5 -418, this section  16 
is endorsing a view of conservatorship that more clearly encourages participation by the 17 
protected pe rson in management of  the protected person's  affairs to the maximum extent 18 
of the protected person's ability.  19 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment (§ 5-419) 20

NONPROBATE TRANSFERS  ON DEATH  19 
PART 1  20 
PROVISIONS RELATING TO EFFECT OF DEATH  21 
§6-101.  Nonprobate transfers on death  22 
1.  Nonprobat e transfer on death nontestamentary.  A provision for a nonprobate 23 
transfer on death in an insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, 24 
promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, account agreement, custodial 25 
agreement, deposit a greement, compensation plan, pension plan, individual retirement 26 
plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift, marital property agreement 27 
or other written instrument of a similar nature is nontestamentary.  Also nontestamentary 28 
is a written  provision that:  29 
A.  Money or other benefits due to, controlled by or owned by a decedent before 30 
death must be paid after the decedent's death to a person whom the decedent 31 
designates either in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, exe cuted 32 
either before or at the same time as the instrument or later;  33 
 
 Page 298 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 B.  Money due or to become due under the instrument ceases to be payable in the 1 
event of death of the promisee or the promisor before payment or demand; or  2 
C.  Any property controlled by o r owned by the decedent before death that is the 3 
subject of the instrument passes to a person the decedent designates either in the 4 
instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or at the 5 
same time as the instrument or later . 6 
2.  Rights of creditors.  Nothing in this section limits the rights of creditors under 7 
other laws of this State.  8 
§6-102.  Liability of nonprobate transferees for creditor claims and statutory 9 
allowances  10 
1.  "Nonprobate transfer" defined.  As used in this  section, "nonprobate transfer" 11 
means a valid transfer effective at death, other than a transfer of a survivorship interest in 12 
a joint tenancy of real estate, by a transferor whose last domicile was in this State, to the 13 
extent that the transferor immediat ely before death had power, acting alone, to prevent 14 
the transfer by revocation or withdrawal and instead to use the property for the benefit of 15 
the transferor or apply the property to discharge claims against the transferor's probate 16 
estate.  17 
2.  Liability  of nonprobate transferee.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, a 18 
transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability to any probate estate of the 19 
decedent for allowed claims against the decedent's probate estate and statutory 20 
allowances to th e decedent's spouse and children to the extent the estate is insufficient to 21 
satisfy those claims and allowances.  The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not 22 
exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that transferee.  23 
3.  Priority of liability.  Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency 24 
described in subsection 2 in the following order of priority:  25 
A.  A transferee designated in the decedent's will or any other governing instrument, 26 
as provided in the instrument;  27 
B.  The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate instrument in the 28 
decedent's estate plan as shown by its designation as devisee of the decedent's 29 
residuary estate or by other facts or circumstances, to the extent of the value of the 30 
nonprobat e transfer received or controlled; and  31 
C.  Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values received.  32 
4.  Interests of beneficiaries to satisfy liability.  Unless otherwise provided by the 33 
trust instrument, interests of beneficiaries in all trusts  incurring liabilities under this 34 
section abate as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all of the trust instruments were a 35 
single will and the interests were devises under it.  36 
5.  Instrument direct apportionment; conflicts.  A provision made in one 37 
instrument may direct the apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees 38 
taking under that instrument or any other governing instrument.  If a provision in one 39 
instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one prevails.  40 
 
 Page 299 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 6.  Liability enforceable in this State.  Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, 1 
the liability imposed by this section is enforceable in proceedings in this State, whether or 2 
not the transferee is located in this State.  3 
7.  Written demand for proceeding.  A proceeding under this section may not be 4 
commenced unless the personal representative of the decedent's estate has received a 5 
written demand for the proceeding from the surviving spouse or a child, to the extent that 6 
statutory allowances are affected, or a creditor.  If the personal representative declines or 7 
fails to commence a proceeding after demand, a person making demand may commence 8 
the proceeding in the name of the decedent's estate at the expense of the person making 9 
the demand and not of the estat e.  A personal representative who declines in good faith to 10 
commence a requested proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.  11 
8.  Deadline for proceedings.  A proceeding under this section must be commenced 12 
within one year after the decedent's de ath, but a proceeding on behalf of a creditor whose 13 
claim was allowed after proceedings challenging disallowance of the claim may be 14 
commenced within 60 days after final allowance of the claim.  15 
9.  Liability of obligor, trustee.   Unless a written notice as serting that a decedent's 16 
probate estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and statutory 17 
allowances has been received from the decedent's personal representative, the following 18 
provisions apply.  19 
A.  Payment or delivery of assets by a fin ancial institution, register or other obligor to 20 
a nonprobate transferee in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument 21 
controlling the transfer releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets 22 
delivered.  23 
B.  A trustee receiving or  controlling a nonprobate transfer is released from liability 24 
under this section with respect to any assets distributed to the trust's beneficiaries.  25 
Each beneficiary to the extent of the distribution received becomes liable for the 26 
amount of the trustee' s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.  27

 2.  Depositor's intent.  A contract of deposit that does not contain pr ovisions in 1

§6-205.  Designation of agent  4 
1.  Designation of agent by all part ies.  By a writing signed by all parties, the 5 
parties may designate as agent of all parties on an account a person other than a party.  6

SUBPART 2  19 
OWNERSHIP AS BETWEEN  PARTIES AND OTHERS  20 
§6-211.  Ownership during lifetime  21 
1.  "Net contribution" defined.  As used in this section, "net contribution" of a party 22 
means the sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less all paymen ts 23 
from the account made to or for the party that have not been paid to or applied to the use 24 
of another party and a proportionate share of any charges deducted from the account, plus 25 
a proportionate share of any interest or dividends earned, whether or no t included in the 26 
current balance.  "Net contribution" includes deposit life insurance proceeds added to the 27 
account by reason of death of the party whose net contribution is in question.  28 
2.  Interest based on net contribution of each party.  During the li fetime of all 29 
parties, an account belongs to the parties in proportion to the net contribution of each to 30 
the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.  31 
As between parties married to each other, in the absence of  proof otherwise the net 32 
contribution of each is presumed to be an equal amount.  33 
3.  Beneficiary; no right to sums.  A beneficiary in an account having a POD 34 
designation has no right to sums on deposit during the lifetime of any party.  35 
4.  Agent; no benefi cial right to sums.  An agent in an account with an agency 36 
designation has no beneficial right to sums on deposit.  37 
 
 Page 304 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §6-212.  Rights at death  1 
1.  Multiple -party account.  Except as otherwise provided in this Part, on death of a 2 
party sums on deposit in a mul tiple-party account belong to the surviving party or parties.  3 
If 2 or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to 4 
which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 5 
6-211 belongs t o the surviving spouse.  If 2 or more parties survive and none is the 6 
surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before 7 
death, was beneficially entitled under section 6 -211 belongs to the surviving parties in 8 
equal shar es and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the 9 
decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under section 6 -211, and the right of 10 
survivorship continues between the surviving parties.  11 
2.  POD designation.  In an account with a  POD designation:  12 
A.  On death of one of 2 or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed 13 
by subsection 1; and  14 
B.  On death of the sole party or the last survivor of 2 or more parties, sums on 15 
deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or ben eficiaries.  If 2 or more 16 
beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares, 17 
and there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary thereafter.  18 
If no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to t he estate of the last surviving 19 
party.  20 
3.  No POD designation; no right of survivorship.  Sums on deposit in a single - 21 
party account without a POD designation, or in a multiple -party account that, by the 22 
terms of the account, is without right of survivorshi p, are not affected by death of a party, 23 
but the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled 24 
under section 6 -211 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate.  A POD designation in 25 
a multiple -party account without r ight of survivorship is ineffective.  For purposes of this 26 
section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is 27 
without right of survivorship.  28 
4.  Liability for unpaid requests for payment.  The ownership right of a sur viving 29 
party or beneficiary, or of the decedent's estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests 30 
for payment made by a party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial 31 
institution before or after death or unpaid.  The surviving party or ben eficiary, or the 32 
decedent's estate, is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment.  The liability is 33 
limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section, to the extent 34 
necessary to discharge the request for payment.  35 
§6-213.  Alteration of rights  36 
1.  Rights determined by terms of account.  Rights at the death of a party under 37 
section 6 -212 are determined by the terms of the account at the death of the party.  A 38 
party may alter the terms of the account by a notice signed by  the party and given to the 39 
financial institution to change the terms of the account or to stop or vary payment under 40 
the terms of the account.  To be effective, the notice must be received by the financial 41 
institution during the party's lifetime.  42 
 
 Page 305 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 2.  Righ t of survivorship not altered by will.  A right of survivorship arising from 1 
the express terms of the account, section 6 -212 or a POD designation may not be altered 2 
by a will.  3 
§6-214.  Accounts and transfers nontestamentary  4 
Except as provided in Article 2,  Part 2 or as a consequence of and to the extent 5 
directed by section 6 -102, a transfer resulting from the application of section 6 -212 is 6 
effective by reason of the terms of the account involved and this Part and is not 7 
testamentary or subject to Articles 1 to 4.  8

single -party account or a multiple -party account.  A financial institution need not inquire 15

from an account.  17

§6-224.  Payment to designated agent  8 
A financial institution, on request of an agent under an agency designation for an 9 
account, may pay to the agent sums on deposit in the account, whether or not a party is 10 
disabled, incapacitated or deceased when the request is made or received and whether or 11 
not the authority of the agent terminates on the disability or incapacity of a party.  12 
§6-225.  Payment to minor  13 
If a financial institution is required or permitted to make payment pursuant to this 14 
Part to a minor designated as a beneficiary, payment may be made pursuant to the Maine 15 
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.  16 
§6-226.  Discharge  17 
1.  Payme nts in accordance with terms of account.  Payment made pursuant to this 18 
Part in accordance with the terms of the account discharges the financial institution from 19 
all claims for amounts so paid, whether or not the payment is consistent with the 20 
beneficial ownership of the account as between parties, beneficiaries or their successors.  21 
Payment may be made whether or not a party, beneficiary or agent is disabled, 22 
incapacitated or deceased when payment is requested, received or made.  23 
2.  Payments after receipt  of notice.  Protection under this section does not extend 24 
to payments made after a financial institution has received written notice from a party, or 25 
from the personal representative, surviving spouse or heir or devisee of a deceased party, 26 
to the effect that payments in accordance with the terms of the account, including one 27 
having an agency designation, should not be permitted, and the financial institution has 28 
had a reasonable opportunity to act on the notice when the payment is made.  Unless the 29 
notice  is withdrawn by the person giving it, the successor of any deceased party must 30 
concur in a request for payment if the financial institution is to be protected under this 31 
section.  Unless a financial institution has been served with process in an action or  32 
proceeding, no other notice or other information shown to have been available to the 33 
financial institution affects its right to protection under this section.  34 
3.  Notice of dispute; refusal to make payments.  A financial institution that 35 
receives written notice pursuant to this section that a dispute exists as to the rights of the 36 
parties may refuse, without liability, to make payments in accordance with the terms of 37 
the account.  38 
4.  Rights of parties in disputes.  Protection of a financial institution und er this 39 
section does not affect the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their 40 
 
 Page 307 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 successors concerning the beneficial ownership of sums on deposit in accounts or 1 
payments made from accounts.  2

setoff is the proportion to w hich the party is, or immediately before death was, 7 
beneficially entitled under section 6 -211 or, in the absence of proof of that proportion, an 8 
equal share with all parties.  9

Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sol e ownership by one 2 
individual or multiple ownership by 2 or more individuals with right of survivorship, 3

owners .  Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries 36 
surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common.  If no 37 
beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the 38 
deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.  39 
 
 Page 309 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 §6-308.  Protection of registering entity  1 
1.  Security registration in beneficiary form not required; protections.  A 2 
registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in 3 
beneficiary form.  If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, 4 
the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to 5 
the registering entity by this Par t. 6 
2.  Registration to be implemented on death.  By accepting a request for 7 
registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the 8 
registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in this Part.  9 
3.  Registering entity discharged from all claims; exceptions.  A registering entity 10 
is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs or devisees of a 11 
deceased owner if the registering entity registers a transfer of the security in accordance 12

A.  The registration;  14 
B.  This Part; and  15

The protections of this Part do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a 19 
registering entity has received written notice from any clai mant to any interest in the 20 
security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form.  No other 21 
notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection 22 
under this Part.  23 
4.  Rights of beneficiaries i n disputes.  The protection provided by this Part to the 24 
registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes 25 
between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its 26 
value or proceeds.  27 
§6-309.  Nontestamentary transfer on death  28 
A transfer on death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form is effective by 29 
reason of the contract regarding the registration between the owner and the registering 30 
entity and this Part and is not testamentar y. 31 
§6-310.  Terms, conditions and forms for registration  32 
1.  Terms and conditions.  A registering entity offering to accept registrations in 33 
beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive 34 
requests:  35 
A.  For registrations  in beneficiary form; and  36 
 
 Page 310 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 B.  For implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for 1 
cancellation of previously registered transfer on death, or "TOD," beneficiary 2 
designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary.  3 
The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or 4 
resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent 5 
beneficiaries and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to tak e the place of the 6 
named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death.  Substitution may be indicated 7 
by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for 8 
"lineal descendants per stirpes." This designation substitutes a  deceased beneficiary's 9 
descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the 10 
descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's 11 
domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descen dants of an intestate.  Other 12 
forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules 13 
for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering 14 
entities regarding conditions and identities r elevant to accurate implementation of 15 
registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and 16 
conditions.  17 
2.  Forms.  The following are illustrations of registrations in beneficiary form that a 18 
registering entity may authori ze: 19 
A.  Sole owner - sole beneficiary:  John S. Brown TOD (or POD) John S. Brown Jr.;  20 
B.  Multiple owners - sole beneficiary:  John S. Brown Mary B. Brown JT TEN TOD 21

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-101) 29 
This section does not constitute a substantive change to Maine law.  Maine has 30 
retained subsection (b) from former Title 18 -A, section 6 -201, which was a nonuniform 31 
provision.  32 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-102) 33 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A, but the concepts for the 34 
most part were previously included in various sections of Maine law, including t he Maine 35 
Uniform Trust Code.  The section serves a useful function of addressing these issues in a 36 
comprehensive way and establishing an order of priority in the procedure for enforcing 37 
claims against various nonprobate assets.  One significant change is t o shorten the time 38 
period for bringing a claim under this section from 2 years after the decedent's date of 39 
 
 Page 311 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 death to one year.  Th e section does not supersede existing law that insulates death 1 
benefits in life insurance contracts, retirement plans or indiv idual retirement account s 2 
from creditors' claims.  3 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-201) 4 
Maine adopts the Uniform Probate Code  wording to coordinate definitions and 5 
consolidate the application of payable on death, or " POD ," accounts and so -called Tott en 6 
Trusts into the comprehensive framework of POD accounts through appropriate 7 
definitions of " beneficiary," " party"  and "POD designation."  The term "joint account" 8 
used throughout former Title 18 -A, section 6 -201 is replaced with "multiple -party 9 
account ," and other accounts previously designated under former Maine law as multiple - 10 
party accounts are addressed through definitions of "POD designation" and " beneficiary" 11 
as well as through other provisions of the Maine Uniform Probate Code . 12

Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-203) 15 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A.  This section  coordinates 16 
with the adoption of forms unde r the Maine Uniform Probate Code, section 6-204 and 17 
sets out clearly the options when an account is established.  18 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-204) 19 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A.  The design  of this form 20 
encourage s the depositor and financial institution to consider the rights of a party to the 21 
account during a party's lifetime and the distribution of the account after a party's death.  22 
Since the form is not required to make the terms of the multiple -party account eff ective, it 23 
offers flexibility and a helpful alternative for depositors.  24 
Maine Uniform Probate Code Comment  (§6-205) 25 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A.  This section allows 26 
financial institutions to offer an option to depositors w ho seek the convenience of an 27 
agency relationship but intend the proceeds of an account to pass according to the 28 
depositor's will or to the depositor's heirs after death.  While not supplanting the 29 
comprehensive Maine Uniform Power of Attorney Act, this se ction offers a limited 30 
agency role for specific financial accounts.  31

 In the absence of proof otherwis e, subsection 2  creates a presumption, as between 1 
parties married to each other, that the net contribution of each  party  is an equal amount.   2 
Maine  Uniform  Probate Code Comment  (§6-212) 3 
Maine law is revised to delete the right to rebut the presumption tha t amounts held in 4 
a joint account pass to the surviving joint tenant.  Prior Maine law permitted the personal 5 
representative of an estate to claim proceeds passed to the estate if there was "clear and 6 
convincing evidence of a different intention at the tim e the account [was] created."  7 
This section includes the presumption that the deceased spouse's interest in a 8 
multiple -party account passes to the surviving spouse.  In most cases, any other party to a 9 
multiple -party account with spouses is a child of the spouses and the intent is to pass the 10 
interest after death to that child but not to increase the child's lifetime interest.   11 
The substance of subsection 4  is new to Maine law and clarifies that a surviving 12 
party's interest in a multiple -party account can be reduced by outstanding checks or other 13 
withdrawals by the deceased party that were made prior to death.  Such reductions might 14 
also include repayment of any automatic deposit, such as a Social Security payment , or 15 
automatic withdrawals for  the bills of a decedent.  16

agent . 2 
Maine  Uniform  Probate  Code Comment  (§6-225) 3 
There is no counterpart to this section in former Title 18 -A.  This section provides for 4 
the efficient and economical transfer of funds to a minor.  The cost and delay associated 5 
with probate court proceedings to appoint a guardian o r conservator can be substantial  6 
compared with the need to provide for the efficient and economical transfer of an 7 
account , and the protections under  the Maine  Uniform Transfers to Minors Act are 8 
sufficient.  9 
Maine  Uniform  Probate Code Comment  (§6-226) 10 
The Maine Uniform Probate Code does not include  the clause in the Uniform Probate 11 
Code, section 6-226(c) that permits a financial institution to refuse payment if it receives 12 
any nonwritten notice giving the financial institution "reason to believe that a disp ute 13 
exists" as to payment rights.  The Maine Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission  14 
determined  that this clause was vague and created unnecessary uncertainty with respect to 15 
a financial institution's right to withhold payment to a party and should not b e adopted.  16

following acts are prohibited:  21 
A.  Engaging in any act of self -dealing, as defined in Section 4941(d) of the Internal 22

Section 4941(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;  24 
B.  Retaining any excess business holdings, as defined in Section 4943(c) of the 25

C.  Making any investments that would jeopardize the carrying out of any of the 28

from time to time to invade principal or accumu late income;  2 
H.  The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income 3 
and effects of inflation and deflation; and  4 
I.  The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.  5 
3.  Adjustments not permitted.   A trustee may not make an a djustment under this 6 
section if any of the following applies:  7 
A.  The adjustment would diminish the income interest in a trust that requires all of 8 
the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift 9 
tax marital deductio n would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not 10 
have the power to make the adjustment;  11 
B.  The adjustment would reduce the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust 12 
to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for  a gift tax exclusion;  13 
C.  The adjustment would change the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed 14 
annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;  15 
D.  The adjustment is from any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable 16 
purposes under a will or the terms of a trust, unless both income and principal are so 17 
set aside;  18 
E.  The trustee's possession or exercise of the power to make an adjustment would 19 
cause an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income  tax 20 
purposes and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not 21 
possess the power to make an adjustment;  22 
F.  The trustee's possession or exercise of the power to make an adjustment would 23 
cause all or part of the trust assets to be  included for estate tax purposes in the estate 24 
of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, 25 
and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did 26 
not possess the power to make an a djustment;  27 
G.  The trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or  28 
H.  The trust has been converted to a unitrust under section 7 -405. 29 
4.  Cotrustees.   If subsection 3, paragraph E, F or G applies to a trustee and there is 30 
more than one trustee, a cotrustee to w hom the provision does not apply may make the 31 
adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is 32 
prohibited by the terms of the trust.  Terms of the trust requiring that if there are 2 or 33 
more trustees serving they must act  by agreement or by any majority or percentage 34 
consensus may not be construed to prohibit the remaining trustee or trustees from 35 
possessing or exercising the power to make the adjustment.  36 
5.  Release of power to adjust.   A trustee may release the entire po wer conferred by 37 
subsection 1 or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the 38 
power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether 39 
possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in sub section 3, 40 
paragraphs A to F or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will 41 
 
 Page 322 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in 1 
subsection 3.  The release of the power to adjust may be permanent or f or a specified 2 
period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.  3 
6.  Terms of trust deny power of adjustment.   Terms of a trust that limit the power 4 
of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the 5 
applicati on of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are 6 
intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection 1.  7 
§7-405.  Power to convert to unitrust  8 
1.  Convert to unitrust; requirements.   Unless expres sly prohibited by the terms of 9 
the trust, a trustee may release the power to adjust under section 7 -404 and convert a trust 10

A.  The trustee determines that the conversion will impr ove the ability of the trustee 12 
to carry out the intent of the settlor and the purposes of the trust;  13 
B.  The trustee gives written notice of the trustee's intention to release the power to 14

following beneficiaries:  17 
(1)  All beneficiaries who are currently eligible to receive income from the trust; 18

C.  There is at least one beneficiary eligible to receive income and at least one 23 
beneficiary who would receive principal as described in paragraph B; and  24 
D.  No beneficiary objects to the conversion to a unitrust in a writing delivered to the 25 
trustee within 60 days of the mailing of the notice required under paragraph B.  26

under subsection 1 or if the requirements of subsection 1, paragraph C are not met, the 28 
trustee may petition the court to approve the conversion to a unitrust.  A beneficiary may 29 
request a trustee to convert to  a unitrust and, if the trustee does not convert, the 30 
beneficiary may petition the court to order the conversion.  Upon receipt of a petition by 31 
the trustee or a beneficiary, the court shall approve the conversion or direct the requested 32 
conversion if the court concludes that the conversion will better enable the trustee to carry 33 
out the intent of the settlor and the purposes of the trust.  34 
3.  Factors.   In deciding whether to exercise the power conferred by subsection 1, a 35 
trustee shall consider the followi ng factors to the extent they are relevant:  36 
A.  The nature, purpose and expected duration of the trust;  37 
B.  The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries and, to the extent reasonably 38 
known to the trustee, the needs of the beneficiaries for present a nd future 39 
distributions authorized or required by the terms of the trust;  40

capital;  2 
D.  The assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets , 3 
interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property or real 4 
property; and the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary;  5 
E.  Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to 6 
invade princ ipal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal 7 
or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power 8 
from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;  9 
F.  The actual and anticipated effect of  economic conditions on principal and income 10 
and effects of inflation and deflation; and  11 
G.  The anticipated tax consequences of the conversion.  12 
4.  After conversion; requirements.   After a trust is converted to a unitrust, all of 13 
the following apply:  14 
A.  The trustee shall follow an investment policy seeking a total return for the 15 
investments held by the trust, whether the return is to be derived from appreciation of 16 
capital, from earnings and distributions from capital or from both;  17 
B.  The trustee shall m ake regular distributions in accordance with the terms of the 18 
trust construed in accordance with the provisions of this section; and  19 
C.  "Income" in the terms of the trust means an annual distribution, known as the 20 
"unitrust distribution," equal to 4%, kno wn as the "payout percentage," of the net fair 21 
market value of the trust's assets, whether such assets would be considered income or 22 
principal under other provisions of this Part, averaged over the lesser of the 3 23 
preceding years and the period during whic h the trust has been in existence.  24 
5.  Trustee's determination.   The trustee of a unitrust subject to this section may in 25 
the trustee's discretion from time to time determine all of the following:  26 
A.  The effective date of a conversion to a unitrust;  27 
B.  The provisions for prorating a unitrust distribution for a short year in which a 28 
beneficiary's right to payment commences or ceases;  29 
C.  The frequency of unitrust distributions during the year;  30 
D.  The effect of other payments from or contributions to the t rust on the trust's 31 
valuation;  32 
E.  Whether to value the trust's assets annually or more frequently;  33 
F.  What valuation dates to use;  34 
G.  How frequently to value nonliquid assets and whether to estimate their value;  35

 Page 324 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 6.  After conversion; allocation provisions.   After a trust is converted to a unitrust, 1 
the following allocation provisions apply to the trust:  2 
A.  Expenses that would be deducted from income if the trust were not a unitrust may 3 
not be deducted from the unitrust distribution; and  4 
B.  Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, the unitru st distribution must 5 
be paid from net income, as net income would be determined if the trust were not a 6 
unitrust.  To the extent net income is insufficient, the unitrust distribution must be 7 
paid from net realized short -term capital gains.  To the extent n et income and net 8 
realized short -term capital gains are insufficient, the unitrust distribution must be paid 9 
from net realized long -term capital gains.  To the extent net income and net realized 10 
short -term and long -term capital gains are insufficient, the unitrust distribution must 11 
be paid from the principal of the trust.  12 
7.  Petition for changes.   The trustee of a unitrust subject to this section or, if the 13 
trustee declines to do so, a beneficiary may petition the court to do any of the following:  14 
A.  Select a payout percentage other than 4%;  15 
B.  Provide for a distribution of net income, as would be determined if the trust were 16 
not a unitrust, in excess of the unitrust distribution if such distribution is necessary to 17 
preserve a tax benefit;  18 
C.  Average the  valuation of the trust's net assets over a period other than 3 years; or  19 
D.  Reconvert from a unitrust.  Upon a reconversion, the power to adjust under 20 
section 7 -404 is revived.  21 
8.  Conversion does not affect certain trust provisions.   A conversion to a u nitrust 22 
does not affect a provision in the terms of the trust directing or authorizing the trustee to 23 
distribute principal or authorizing a beneficiary to withdraw a portion or all of the 24 
principal.  25 
9.  Conversion not permitted.   A trustee may not convert a trust into a unitrust if 26 
any of the following applies:  27 
A.  Payment of the unitrust distribution would change the amount payable to a 28 
beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;  29 
B.  The unitrust distribution would be made from any amount that is permanently set 30 
aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of the trust unless both income 31 
and principal are so set aside;  32 
C.  The trustee's possession or exercise of the power to convert would cause an 33 
individu al to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax 34 
purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not 35 
possess the power to convert;  36 
D.  The trustee's possession or exercise of the power to convert wo uld cause all or 37 
part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an 38 
individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and 39 
 
 Page 325 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the  trustee did not 1 
possess the power to convert;  2 
E.  The conversion would result in the disallowance of an estate tax or gift tax marital 3 
deduction that would be allowed if the trustee did not have the power to convert; or  4 
F.  The trustee is a beneficiary of  the trust.  5 
10.  Conversion by cotrustee.   If subsection 9, paragraph C, D or F applies to a 6 
trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not 7 
apply may convert the trust unless the exercise of the power by the remainin g trustee or 8 
trustees is prohibited by the terms of the trust.  Terms of the trust requiring that if there 9 
are 2 or more trustees serving they must act by agreement or by any majority or 10 
percentage consensus may not be construed to prohibit the remaining t rustee or trustees 11 
from exercising the power to convert.  If subsection 9, paragraph C, D or F applies to all 12 
the trustees, the trustees may petition the court to direct a conversion.  13 
11.  Release of power to convert.   A trustee may release the power confe rred by 14 
subsection 1 to convert to a unitrust if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or 15 
exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection 9, paragraph C, D or E or 16 
if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the pow er will or may deprive the 17 
trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection 9.  The release of 18 
the power to convert to a unitrust may be permanent or for a specified period, including a 19 
period measured by the life of an individual.  20 
§7-406.  Judicial review of discretionary powers  21 
1.  Court determination of abuse of fiduciary's discretion.   A court may not 22 
change a fiduciary's decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power 23 
conferred by this Part unless it determines th at the decision was an abuse of the 24 
fiduciary's discretion.  A court may not determine that a fiduciary abused the fiduciary's 25 
discretion merely because the court would have exercised the discretion in a different 26 
manner or would not have exercised the dis cretion.  27 
2.  Abuse of discretion; remedy.   If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused 28 
the fiduciary's discretion in exercising a discretionary power conferred by this Part, the 29 
remedy is to restore the income and remainder beneficiaries to the posit ions they would 30 
have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused the fiduciary's discretion, according to the 31 
provisions of this subsection:  32 
A.  To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a 33 
beneficiary or a distribution that  is too small, the court shall require the fiduciary to 34 
distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will 35 
restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position;  36 
B.  To the extent that th e abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a 37 
beneficiary that is too large, the court shall restore the beneficiaries or the trust, or 38 
both, in whole or in part, to their appropriate positions by requiring the fiduciary to 39 
withhold an amount f rom one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who 40 
received the distribution that was too large or requiring that beneficiary or that 41 
 
 Page 326 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 beneficiary's estate to return some or all of the distribution to the trust, 1 
notwithstanding a spendthrift or sim ilar provision;  2 
C.  If the abuse of discretion concerns the power to convert a trust into a unitrust, the 3 
court shall require the trustee either to convert the trust to a unitrust or to reconvert 4 
from a unitrust; and  5 
D.  To the extent that the court is una ble, after applying paragraphs A, B and C, to 6 
restore the beneficiaries or the trust, or both, to the positions they would have 7 
occupied if the fiduciary had not abused the fiduciary's discretion, the court may 8 
require the fiduciary to pay an appropriate a mount from the fiduciary's own funds to 9 
one or more of the beneficiaries or the trust, or both.  10 
3.  Proposed exercise or nonexercise of discretion; court determination.   Upon a 11 
petition by the fiduciary, a court having jurisdiction over the trust or estate  shall 12 
determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary 13 
power conferred by this Part will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.  If the 14 
petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power  and contains 15 
sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts 16 
upon which the fiduciary relies and an explanation of how the income and remainder 17 
beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexe rcise of the power, a 18 
beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of 19 
establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.  20 
SUBPART 2  21 
DECEDENT'S ESTATE OR  TERMINATING INCOME I NTEREST  22 
§7-421.  Determination and distri bution of net income  23 
After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust 24 
ends, the provisions of this section apply.  25 
1.  Determination of net income and net principal.  A fiduciary of an estate or of a 26 
terminating income  interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal 27 
receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the provisions of 28 
subparts 3 to 5 that apply to trustees and the provisions of subsection 5.  The fiduciary 29 
shall  distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to 30 
receive the specific property.  31 
2.  Requirements for determinations.  A fiduciary shall determine the remaining 32 
net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income inte rest under the provisions of 33 
subparts 3 to 5 that apply to trustees and by:  34 
A.  Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;  35 
B.  Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, 36 
accountan ts and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and 37 
interest on death taxes; but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of 38 
property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or 39 
 
 Page 327 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 charitable deduct ion only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from 1 
income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and  2 
C.  Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection 3 
with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income 4 
interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, exempt property 5 
and allowances distributable pursuant to Article 2, Part 4 and death taxes and related 6 
penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, 7 
the terms of the trust or applicable law.  8 
3.  Distribution to beneficiary.  A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who 9 
receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the 10 
will, the terms of the trust or applicable law from net income determined under 11 
subsection 2 or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient.  If a 12 
beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest 13 
ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable 14 
law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary 15 
would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were requi red to be paid 16 
under a will under section 3 -904. 17 
4.  Distribution to other beneficiary.  A fiduciary shall distribute the net income 18 
remaining after distributions required by subsection 3 in the manner described in section 19 
7-422 to all other beneficiaries,  including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount 20 
in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the 21 
trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.  22 
5.  Reduction of principal o r income receipts not permitted.  A fiduciary may not 23 
reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection 1 because of a 24 
payment described in section 7 -461 or 7 -462 to the extent that the will, the terms of the 25 
trust or applicable law  requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than 26 
the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment 27 
from a 3rd party.  The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined 28 
by incl uding all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, 29 
whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on or after the date of a decedent's 30 
death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provi sion for 31 
amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become 32 
obligated to pay after the property is distributed.  33 
§7-422.  Distribution to residuary and remainder beneficiaries  34 
1.  Distribution based on fractional intere st.  Each beneficiary described in section 35 
7-421, subsection 4 is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the 36 
beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the 37 
distribution date.  If a fiduciary ma kes more than one distribution of assets to 38 
beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not 39 
receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income 40 
the fiduciary has received a fter the date of death or terminating event or earlier 41 
distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.  42 
 
 Page 328 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 2.  Determination of share.  In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the 1 
provisions of this subsection apply:  2 
A.  The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the 3 
beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately 4 
before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal 5 
obligations;  6 
B.  The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be 7 
calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property 8 
required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust;  9 
C.  The beneficiary' s fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be 10 
calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution 11 
date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation; and  12 
D.  The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the 13 
fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on 14 
which assets are actually distributed.  15 
3.  Records required if not all distributed.  If a fiduciary does not d istribute all of 16 
the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the 17 
fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in 18 
that net income.  19 
4.  Application of provisions.  A fiduciary may apply the provisions of this section, 20 
to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after 21 
the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a 22 
principal asset if this se ction applies to the income from the asset.  23 
SUBPART 3  24 
APPORTIONMENT AT BEG INNING AND END OF IN COME INTEREST  25 
§7-431.  When right to income begins and ends  26 
1.  Beginning of income interest.  An income beneficiary is entitled to net income 27 
from the date on wh ich the income interest begins.  An income interest begins on the date 28 
specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes 29 
subject to a trust or successive income interest.  30 
2.  Asset subject to trust.  An asset bec omes subject to a trust:  31 
A.  On the date it is transferred to the trust in the case of an asset that is transferred to 32 
a trust during the transferor's life;  33 
B.  On the date of a testator's death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a 34 
trust by re ason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the 35 
testator's estate; or  36 
C.  On the date of an individual's death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a 37 
fiduciary by a 3rd party because of the individual's death.  38 
 
 Page 329 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 3.  Successive income interest.  An asset becomes subject to a successive income 1 
interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under 2 
subsection 4, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the 3 
preceding i ncome interest.  4 
4.  Ending of income interest.  An income interest ends on the day before an income 5 
beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs or on the last day of a period during 6 
which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute in come.  7 
§7-432.  Apportionment of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or 8 
income interest begins  9 
1.  Application to principal.  A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or 10 
disbursement other than one to which section 7 -421, subsection 1 applies to  principal if 11 
its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income 12 
interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.  13 
2.  Application to income.  A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or 14 
disburseme nt to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent 15 
dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date.  An income receipt or 16 
disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or 17 
it has no due date.  The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on 18 
which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal and the 19 
balance must be allocated to income.  20 
3.  Due date.  An item of income or a n obligation is due on the date the payor is 21 
required to make a payment.  If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the 22 
purposes of this Part.  Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to 23 
which section 7 -441 applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for 24 
determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the 25 
declaration date for the distribution.  A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements 26 
that must be paid at r egular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an 27 
entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.  28 
§7-433.  Apportionment when income interest ends  29 
1.  Undistributed income.  As used in this section, "undistributed income " means net 30 
income received before the date on which an income interest ends.  "Undistributed 31 
income" does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net 32 
income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the t erms of the 33 
trust.  34 
2.  End of mandatory income interest.  When a mandatory income interest ends, the 35 
trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate 36 
of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the  interest to end, the 37 
beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of 38 
the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than 5% of the 39 
trust immediately before the income interest ends.  In the latter case, the undistributed 40 
income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.  41 
 
 Page 330 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 3.  Prorate final payment.  When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a 1 
fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets en ds, the trustee shall prorate the final 2 
payment to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or 3

circumstances described in section 7 -404, subsection 4 and may be released for the 20 
reasons and in the manner described in section 7 -404, subsection 5.  An allocation  is 21

following terms have the following meanings.  31 
A.  "Payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of 32 
years or during the life of one or more in dividuals because of services rendered or 33 
property transferred to the payor in exchange for future payments.  "Payment" 34 
includes a payment made in money or property from the payor's general assets or 35 
from a separate fund created by the payor.  For the purp oses of subsections 4, 5, 6 36 
and 7, "payment" also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the 37 
reason for the payment.  38 
 
 Page 334 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 B.  "Separate fund" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual 1 
retirement account and a pension, profit -sharing, stock -bonus or stock -ownership 2 
plan.  3 
2.  Payment is interest or dividend; allocate to income.  To the extent that a 4 
payment is characterized as interest, a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a 5 
dividend, a trustee shall allocate the pa yment to income.  The trustee shall allocate to 6 
principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same 7 
accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend or an equivalent 8 
payment.  9 
3.  Payment not interest or divide nd; allocation based on if required.  If no part 10 
of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend or an equivalent payment, and all or 11 
part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income 10% of the 12 
part that is required to b e made during the accounting period and the balance to principal.  13 
If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire 14 
amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to 15 
principal.  Fo r purposes of this subsection, a payment is not required to be made to the 16 
extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.  17 
4.  Payment qualifies for marital deduction.  Except as otherwise provided in 18 
subsection 5, subsections 6  and 7 apply and subsections 2 and 3 do not apply in 19 
determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to a trust:  20 
A.  That qualifies for the marital deduction under the federal Internal Revenue Code, 21 
26 United States Code, Section 2056(b)( 7) (2010), as amended, and for which either 22 
such an election has been made for federal purposes or for which an election under 23 
the pertinent provisions of the laws of the State to qualify as Maine qualified 24 
terminable interest property has been made; or  25 
B.  That qualifies for the marital deduction under the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 
26 United States Code, Section 2056(b)(5) (2010), as amended.  27 
5.  Series of payments qualify for marital deduction.  Subsections 4, 6 and 7 do not 28 
apply if and to the exten t that the series of payments would, without the application of 29 
subsection 4, qualify for the marital deduction under the federal Internal Revenue Code, 30 
26 United States Code, Section 2056(b)(7)(C) (2010), as amended.  31 
6.  Internal income of separate fund.  A trustee shall determine the internal income 32 
of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject 33 
to this Part.  Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the 34 
person administering the sepa rate fund distribute the internal income to the trust.  The 35 
trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the 36 
internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse.  37 
The trustee shall a llocate the balance of the payment to principal.  Upon request of the 38 
surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal 39 
income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust 40 
during t he accounting period.  41 
 
 Page 335 - 128LR0452(01) -1 
 7.  Value of separate fund.  If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a 1 
separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the 2 
separate fund is deemed to equal 4% of the fund's value, ac cording to the most recent 3 
statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period.  If the trustee can 4 
determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the 5 
internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the prod uct of the interest rate and the 6 
present value of the expected future payments, as determined under the federal Internal 7 
Revenue Code, 26 United States Code, Section 7520 (2010), as amended, for the month 8 
preceding the accounting period for which the compu tation is made.  9

trust or a beneficiary.  15 
2.  Increase in estate tax, reduction in income taxes.  If the amount of an estate tax 16 
marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a  fiduciary 17 
deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for 18 
estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and 19 
income taxes paid by an estate, trust or beneficiary are decreased,  each estate, trust or 20 
beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal 21 
from which the increase in estate tax is paid.  The total reimbursement must equal the 22 
increase in the estate tax to the extent that the principa l used to pay the increase would 23 
have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the 24 
payment.  The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust or 25 
beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the  same as its proportionate share 26 
of the total decrease in income tax.  An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from 27 
income.  28

filed, where the genetic mother became pregnant or where the putative father is most 13 
likely to be located.  The notice must specify the names of the genetic mother and the 14

signing the waiver of notice the putative father or legal father voluntarily gives up 24 
any rights to the child.  25
