Page 1 - 128LR2930(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3214, sub-§2-A, as enacted  by PL 2013, c. 556, §1, is 
3 amended to read:
4 2-A.  Arrearage management program.  Each transmission and distribution utility 
5 shall implement pursuant  to this subsection an arrearage management program to assist 
6 eligible low-income  residential customers  who are in arrears on their electricity  bills.   An 
7 arrearage management  program  implemented pursuant to this subsection  is a plan under  
8 which a transmission and distribution  utility works with an eligible  low-income 
9 residential customer to establish an affordable  payment plan and provide credit  to that 
10 customer toward the customer's  accumulated arrears  as long as that customer  remains in 
11 compliance with the terms of the program.  The commission  shall establish requirements  
12 relating to the arrearage management programs by rule.  Rules adopted pursuant to this 
13 subsection are routine technical rules pursuant  to Title  5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
14 In adopting  rules regarding arrearage management programs, the  commission shall:
15 A.  Consider  best practices as developed  and implemented in other states  or regions;
16 B.  Require that an arrearage management program include  an electricity usage 
17 assessment at no cost to the  participant;
18 C.  Permit  each transmission and distribution utility  to propose a start date for its 
19 program that  is no later than October  1, 2015;
20 D.  Ensure that each transmission  and distribution  utility develops  terms  and 
21 conditions for its arrearage management program  in a manner  that is consistent with 
22 the program's objectives  and is in the best interests of all  ratepayers; and
23 E.  Ensure that a transmission  and distribution utility  recovers in rates all costs of 
24 arrearage management programs,  including  incremental costs, reconnection  fees and 
25 administrative and marketing costs but not including the amount of any arrearage 
26 forgiven that is treated  as bad debt for purposes  of cost recovery by the transmission 
27 and distribution  utility.;
28 F.  Ensure that a transmission and distribution  utility recovers in rates its prudent 
29 costs for any 3rd-party  assistance it receives in administering its arrearage 
30 management program; and
31 G.  Permit a transmission and distribution utility to recover in rates its prudent costs 
32 for providing financial and budgetary  guidance to participants whether  provided 
33 directly or through a 3rd party contracted  by the transmission and distribution utility  
34 to provide that guidance.
35 The Efficiency Maine  Trust  shall  work with transmission and distribution utilities and 
36 other stakeholders  to provide  access to a complementary low-income energy  efficiency  
37 program for participants in arrearage management programs in order  to help reduce 
38 participants' energy consumption.
39 No later than January 28, 2018 2021, the commission shall prepare a report assessing the 
40 effectiveness of arrearage management programs, including the number  of participants  
41 enrolled in the programs, the number  of participants completing the programs, the 
Page 2 - 128LR2930(01)-11 number of participants who have failed to complete the programs, the payment patterns of 
2 participating customers after completing the programs, the dollar  amount of arrears 
3 forgiven, a comparison of outcomes for those participating in the programs and those not 
4 participating, the impact on a transmission and distribution utility's bad debt as a result of 
5 the programs,  the costs and benefits to all ratepayers associated with the programs and 
6 recommendations for ways  in which the programs might  be improved or continued for 
7 the benefit of all ratepayers.  In preparing its report, the commission shall  hold at least 
8 one formal stakeholder meeting involving affected parties, including  the Office of the 
9 Public Advocate  and the participating transmission and distribution utilities.  Parties  must 
10 also be provided an opportunity to submit written  comments to the commission regarding 
11 the performance of the programs.
12 The joint standing  committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities matters  
13 may report out a bill relating to the commission report to the Second  First Regular  
14 Session of the  128th 130th Legislature.
15 This subsection is repealed September 30, 2018 2021.
16 Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA  §10110, sub-§2,  ¶L, as enacted  by PL 2013, c. 556, §2, is 
17 amended to read:
18 L.  Pursuant to section  3214, subsection  2-A, the trust shall work  with transmission 
19 and distribution utilities and other stakeholders to provide access to a complementary  
20 low-income energy efficiency program for participants in the arrearage management  
21 programs in  order  to help  reduce participants' energy consumption.
22 This paragraph is repealed September 30, 2018 2021.
23 SUMMARY
24 This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
25 Technology pursuant to the Maine Revised  Statutes, Title 35-A, section  3214, subsection 
26 2-A.  The law requires the Public Utilities Commission to provide  the committee  with a 
27 report assessing the effectiveness of arrearage management programs  and provides the 
28 committee with the authority to report out a bill relating to the  report.
29 The committee has not taken  a position on the substance of this bill, and by reporting  
30 this bill out, the committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees 
31 or disagrees with any aspect  of this bill.  The committee  is reporting the bill out for the 
32 sole purpose of turning  the proposal of some  of the stakeholders into a printed  bill that 
33 can be referred  to the committee for an appropriate public hearing and subsequent 
34 processing in the normal  course.   The committee  is taking  this action to ensure clarity and 
35 transparency in the  legislative review  of the proposal.
36 This bill extends arrearage management programs and the requirement that the 
37 Efficiency Maine Trust provide access to a complementary low-income energy efficiency  
38 program for participants in arrearage management programs  to September  30, 2021.  It 
39 establishes a new reporting requirement for the Public Utilities Commission and gives the 
40 committee authority to report out a bill to the First Regular Session of the 130th 
41 Legislature based on the report.  It also clarifies that rules adopted by the commission 
Page 3 - 128LR2930(01)-11 must ensure that a transmission and distribution  utility recovers its prudent costs for 
2 3rd-party assistance in administering an arrearage management program  and must permit 
3 a transmission and distribution  utility  to recover its prudent costs for providing  financial 
4 and budgetary guidance to participating customers, even if the transmission and 
5 distribution utility has a  3rd party provide that guidance on its behalf.
