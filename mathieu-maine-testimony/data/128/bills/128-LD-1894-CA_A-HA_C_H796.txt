This amendment will transfer $1,000,000 from the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) within the Commission on 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund within 10 days of the 
effective date of this bill. (This fiscal note assumes that will occur early in fiscal year 2018-19.) It is anticipated that 
this will leave a cash balance of approximately $3,300,000 in the MCEF. This amendment also reverses this 
transaction later in fiscal year 2018-19 by transferring, on or before January 1, 2019, $1,000,000 from the General 
Fund back to the MCEF. As amended, the MCEF may require additional allocation if the full amount of funding 
available in fiscal year 2018-19 is to be expended. That allocation will need to be provided either by additional 
legislative action or by financial order.
