 SUMMARY  1 
This bill is presented in response to the United States District Court decision in 2 
Woodhouse, et al. v. Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, 3 
et al. , United States District Court, District of Maine, Docket No. 1:14 -CV-266-DBH.  4 
The b ill provides that contributions received by a candidate for a primary election 5 
must be segregated from those received for the general election. The bill allows a 6 
candidate who is unopposed in a primary election to use in the general election primary 7 
electi on contributions received prior to the deadline by which primary candidates must 8 
submit petitions to take part in a primary election. Contributions carried forward from the 9 
primary election to the general election are subject to the dollar limits that appl y to 10 
contributions made to a candidate by a single donor. The bill permits a candidate who 11 
defeats a primary opponent to carry forward to the general election unspent contributions 12 
received for the primary election. Regardless of whether the candidate was opposed in a 13 
primary election, if the sum of a primary election contribution and a general election 14 
contribution from the same donor exceeds contribution limits, the candidate must return 15 
at least the excess amount to the donor.  16 
The bill specifies that con tributions received for the purpose of supporting a 17 
candidate in a primary election may not be used primarily to support the candidate's 18 
general election campaign.  19 
The bill repeals the limit of $25,000 per calendar year on an individual's aggregate 20 
contrib utions to all political candidates.  21 
Finally, the bill also makes technical, cross -reference changes.  22
