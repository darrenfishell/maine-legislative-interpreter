Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Establishes new Class A crimes; increases correctional and judicial costs ~~ 
The additional workload associated with the minimal number of new felony cases filed in the court system does not 
require additional funding at this time. 
The collection of additional fines may increase General Fund or other dedicated revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), to the extent existing resources are 
available, to develop and institute a community outreach program regarding female genital mutilation that provides 
support services, training and educational materials. If DHHS determines that resources are available for the program, 
the costs that would be incurred would not require an additional appropriation.
