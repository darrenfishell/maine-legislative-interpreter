Agreement to receive trust funds pursuant to the Volkswagen Partial Consent Decree, 
which settles portions of the multidistrict litigation concerning certain Volkswagen diesel

SUMMARY 
This amendment requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the 
Department of Environmental Protection and the Governor's Energy Office, to include in 
the State's beneficiary mitigation plan the proposal to allocate 15% of the trust funds 
received for light-duty zero emission vehicle supply equipment as permitted by the 
Volkswagen Partial Consent Decree. If the mitigation plan is approved, it requires that 
the funds be used in whole or in part to provide grants for the installation of light-duty 
zero emission vehicle supply equipment. It requires that grants funded with the trust 
funds be disbursed to projects that meet certain preferential selection criteria. It allows 
the Department of Transportation to disburse funds for the installation of light-duty zero 
emission vehicle supply equipment within an existing program or a new program 
developed in consultation with the Efficiency Maine Trust. Lastly, it requires that the 
Department of Transportation submit by January 15, 2018 a report to the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology describing the status of the State's 
beneficiary mitigation plan, the plan to use funds for a new or existing grant program and 
the need, if any, for legislation for a grant program.
