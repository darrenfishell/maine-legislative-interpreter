Like the bill, the amendment expands the number of commission members from 5 to 
9. The Governor is still responsible for appointing all members. The amendment 
increases the number to be appointed from a list of qualified potential appointees 
provided by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court from one, as in current law, 
to 3. The amendment requires one appointment from a list of qualified potential 
appointees submitted by the Maine State Bar Association and one appointed from a list 
provided by a statewide organization, other than the Maine State Bar Association, that 
represents criminal defense attorneys. The amendment requires the Governor to appoint 
a member who has experience in administration and finance as well as a member who has 
experience providing representation in child protection proceedings. 
Current law requires appointees to have the knowledge and skills required to ensure 
that quality of representation is provided in each area of law. The amendment removes 
the skill requirement. The amendment provides that no more than 7 members may be 
attorneys engaged in the active practice oflaw. 
The amendment also addresses issues regarding potential conflicts of interest. It 
provides that no voting members may receive compensation from the commission, other 
than the per diem and expenses authorized by statute, while a member of the commission. 
The limitation on compensation from the commission also applies to a member whose 
immediate family member living in the same household is receiving compensation from 
the commission. The limitation on compensation does not apply to any member serving 
on the commission on April 1, 2018 for the duration of that member's term. 
fu addition, the amendment makes ineligible for appointment a person who is a 
sitting judge, a prosecutor or a law enforcement official or an employee of any of these 
individuals. 
The amendment addresses the issue of how many members constitute a quorum. The 
amended language defines a quorum as a majority of the current voting members, which 
will allow the commission to function as it transitions from 5 members to 7 voting 
members. 
As 4 additional members will be appointed to the commission, the amendment directs 
the Governor to designate one of the new members to serve a full 3-year term, 2 members 
to serve an initial 2-year term and one member to serve an initial term of one year.
