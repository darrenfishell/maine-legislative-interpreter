school administrative unit by a private school is the rate established under subsection 1 or 6 
the state average per public secondary student cost as adjusted, whi chever is lower, plus 7

insured value of school buildings and equipment by the average number of pupils 9 
enrolled in the school on October 1st and April 1st of the year immed iately before the 10 
school year for which the tuition charge is computed.  From school year 2009 -2010 to 11 
school year 2013 -2014, a school administrative unit is not required to pay an insured 12 
value factor greater than 5% of the school's tuition rate or $500 p er student, whichever is 13 
less, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to authorize its 14 
school board to pay a higher insured value factor that is no greater than 10% of the 15 
school’s tuition rate per student.  For the 2014 -2015 s chool year, a school administrative 16 
unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than 6% of the school's tuition 17 
rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to 18

administrative unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than the amount 21 
of the prior school year's insured value factor adjusted by a percentage equal to the 22 
percentage change in the state share percentage of the total cost of funding public 23 
education in the prior school year as determined by section 15671, subsection 7, 24 
paragraph C D as compared  to the applicable percentage for the current school year.  In 25 
no case may the insured value factor be less than 6% or greater than 10% of the school's 26 
tuition rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes 27 
to authori ze its school board to pay an insured value factor that exceeds the amount 28 
otherwise permitted by this subsection by no more than 5% of the school's tuition rate per 29 
student.  For the 2013 -2014 school year only, the maximum allowable tuition charged to 30 
a school administrative unit by a private school that participates in the Maine Public 31 
Employees Retirement System must be increased above the amount otherwise permitted 32

empl oyment beginning with the most recent employer,  or to the General Fund if the 16 
otherwise chargeable experience rating record is that of an employer whose status as 17 
such has been terminated; except that no charge may be made to an individual 18

(5)  Reimbursements are made to a state, the Virgin Islands or Canada for 27 
benefits paid to a claimant under a reciprocal benefits arrangement as authorized 28 
in section 1082, subsection 12, as long as the wages of the claimant transferred to 29 
the other state, the Virgin Islands or Canada under such an arrangement are less 30 
than the amount of wages for insured work required for benefit purposes by 31 
section 1192, subsection 5;  32 
(6)  The claimant was hired by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 33 
open by a Legislator given a leave of absence under chapter 7, subchapter 5 -A, 34

and a licensee may conduct such a game regardless of whether the manner of determining 28 
the winner is specifically described as a permissible manner of determinin g the winner in 29 
rules adopted by the Chief of State Police.   For the purposes of this chapter, to hold, 30 
conduct or operate beano includes charging a fee or offering something of value to play 31 
in exchange for the opportunity to receive something of value fo r winning a game.  32
