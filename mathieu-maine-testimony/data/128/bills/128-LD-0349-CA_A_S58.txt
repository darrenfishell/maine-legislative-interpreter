This bill establishes a mattress recycling fee of $5 added to the retail price of each mattress sold in the State starting 
on January 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2021. Retailers may retain $1 of the fee for the administrative costs of 
collecting the fee, with the remaining $4 deposited into the newly established Mattress Recycling Grant Fund 
(MRGF) within the Department ofEnviromnental Protection (DEP). Based on a similar program in Connecticut and 
an estimated total for national mattress sales and then prorated for population, it is anticipated that approximately 
110,572 mattresses will be disposed of annually in Maine. The mattress recycling fee will generate $221,144 to the 
Mattress Recycling Grant Fund in fiscal year 2017-18 and $442,287 in fiscal year 2018-19. The MRGF will be used to 
provide grants to entities or programs designed to increase the recycling of disposed mattress units and reduce their 
entry into the waste stream. Up to 10% of the revenue deposited into the MRGF maybe used by the DEP for the 
development and administration of the program. 
The bill includes allocations to the MRGF of $22,114 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $44,229 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 
one part-time Enviromnental Specialist III position to administer the mattress recycling grant program. It also includes 
allocations of $199,030 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $398,058 in fiscal year 2018-19 for grants to entities or programs 
that meet the mattress recycling program criteria.
