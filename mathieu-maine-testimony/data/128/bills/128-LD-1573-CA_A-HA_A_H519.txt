STATE OF MAINE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
HOUSE AMENDMENT "A "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 551, 
L.D. 1573, Bill, "An Act To Encourage Development in the Logging Industry by 
Requiring State and Local Govemment Agencies To Give Preference to Lumber and 
Solid Wood Products Harvested in the State" 
Amend the amendment in the 9th paragraph after the substitute title in the first 5 lines 
(page 1, lines 33 and 34 and page 2, lines 1 to 3 in amendment) by striking out the first 
sentence and inserting the following: Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 
contrary, and to the extent consistent with federal law, if the State provides a subsidy to a 
person who sells timber harvested in this State, the person shall use an in-state contractor 
to harvest and transport that timber, as long as the price and quality of the work 
performed by that in-state contractor is equal to that of a contractor from outside the 
State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the requirement that a person who receives a subsidy from 
the State and who purchases timber give preference to timber harvested by an in-state 
contractor. Instead this amendment requires a person who receives a subsidy from the 
State and who sells timber harvested in this State to use an in-state contractor for the 
harvesting and transp01tation of that timber, as long as the price and quality of the work 
performed by that in-state contractor is equal to the price and quality of work performed 
by a contractor from outside the State.
