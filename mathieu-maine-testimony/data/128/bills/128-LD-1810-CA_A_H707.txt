SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. This amendment strikes 
from the bill language that changes the definition of "expedited permitting area" to mean 
specified places that are identified by rule and the eastern portion of Aroostook County. 
This amendment also provides that 15 miles, instead of 40 miles as proposed in the bill, is 
the farthest distance from a proposed expedited wind energy development for which a 
visual impact assessment for potentially affected scenic resources of state or national 
significance may be required.
