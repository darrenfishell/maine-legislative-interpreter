the fair market value is the price at which the same or similar types and qualities of foods 8 
were sold by the food producer in the past 5 years.  The fair market value may not exceed 9 
the fair market value used to claim the federal c haritable deduction with respect to a 10

E.  The fair market value of the donation determined in accordance with subsection 3; 23 
and 24 
F.  The signature of a representative of the nonprofit food assistance organization or 25

organization or public or private school to which the  donation was made indicating 29
