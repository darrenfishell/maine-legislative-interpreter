SUMMARY 
The bill establishes the Maine Mental Health Providers Loan Repayment Program, 
which allows certain types of licensed social workers and professional counselors to 
apply for loan repayment assistance, as long as the applicants agree to practice for 5 years 
in one of a list of underserved practice areas in the State. This amendment expands the 
pool of providers eligible to apply for the program to include all social workers licensed 
by the State Board of Social Worker Licensure and all counselors licensed by the Board 
of Counseling Professionals Licensure and expands the categories of underserved practice 
areas to include federally qualified health centers, community-based behavioral health 
centers and organizations exempt from taxation under the United States Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, Section 501(c)(6). 
The amendment further clarifies that the program is funded through a one-time 
appropriation of $1,000,000, rather than an ongoing appropriation as in the bill.
