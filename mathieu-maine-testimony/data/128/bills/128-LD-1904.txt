23 SUMMARY
24 This bill is reported  out by a majority  of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal 
25 Justice and Public Safety pursuant to Joint Order 2017, S.P.  709.
26 This bill defines "female  genital  mutilation" as the circumcision, excision, mutilation 
27 or infibulation, in whole or in part, of the labia majora,  labia minora  or clitoris  of a female 
28 individual but excludes from the definition medical procedures that are necessary to the 
29 health of the female individual or performed for medical  purposes on a female individual 
30 in labor or who has just given birth,  as long as the medical procedure was performed by a 
31 person licensed in the State by the Board of Licensure in Medicine or the Board  of 
32 Osteopathic Licensure  or by a licensed  midwife or a person in an approved  training 
33 program under the  supervision  of a physician or midwife licensed in this State.
34 The bill makes it a Class A crime to perform female genital mutilation  on a female 
35 individual under 18 years of age, to knowingly transport  a female individual under 18 
36 years of age outside of this State  for purposes  of female genital mutilation or to 
37 knowingly consent to female genital mutilation of a female individual  under  18 years of 
38 age.  Under  the provisions of the bill, it is not a defense  that the victim  or the parent,  
39 guardian or person  who has immediate  custody of the victim  consented to the procedure 
40 or believed that it was desired  as part of a social norm or was necessary for custom, 
41 religion or  ritual.
Page 3 - 128LR2988(01)-11 The bill extends the statute of limitations for female genital mutilation  offenses to the 
2 25th birthday of a victim  of female genital mutilation.  Commission  of a female genital 
3 mutilation offense by a person licensed  by the Board  of Licensure in Medicine or the 
4 Board of Osteopathic  Licensure or a midwife licensed in Maine is grounds for permanent 
5 revocation of the  license of  that person.
6  This bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services, to the extent 
7 existing resources are available, to develop and institute a community outreach program  
8 regarding female  genital mutilation that provides support  services,  training  and
