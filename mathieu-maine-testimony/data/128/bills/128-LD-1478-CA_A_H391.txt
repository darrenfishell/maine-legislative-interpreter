Whereas, investing in the rehabilitation and revitalization of nonproductive

economic challenges faced by these rural communities; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,'

following:

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Authorizing the Maine Rural Development Authority (MRDA) to utilize funds from its Commercial Facilities 
Development Program for the newly established Rural Manufacturing and Industrial Site Redevelopment Program 
will have no fiscal impact to the State. This provision will, however, result in less funds being available for the 
Commercial Facilities Development Program. According to the Finance Authority of Maine, who administers the 
funds for the MRDA, it had $4,859,186 available to fund all of its programs as of March 31, 2017, with a total of 
$4,108,176 available to lend.
