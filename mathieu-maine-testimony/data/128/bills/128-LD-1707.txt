Page 1 - 128LR2750(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention,  Maine  
4 has a reported rate of acute hepatitis C nearly 3 times the average  rate found in the United 
5 States, a  rate largely driven by  sharing  syringes.  Untreated hepatitis C can be fatal; and
6 Whereas, the United  States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has flagged  
7 several Maine  counties  as being susceptible to an HIV outbreak akin to the surge in new 
8 cases of HIV in Scott County, Indiana, where  new cases of HIV increased  from  an 
9 average of 5 per year to 190 in 2015 alone.  Analysts determined  this crisis was fueled  by 
10 injection drug use and lack of access  to syringe exchange programs and testing services; 
11 and
12 Whereas, the comparative cost of treating these problems is far more than the cost 
13 of preventing  these problems; and
14 Whereas, while most other states with legal syringe exchange programs publicly 
15 fund those programs,  Maine  does not.  Maine's network of 5 syringe exchange programs  
16 is lacking  in resources, and, in some  cases, programs are closing their doors.  Also, many 
17 residents, especially  residents in rural counties, lack access  to these programs altogether; 
18 and
19 Whereas, the longer  it takes the Legislature to act on this crisis, the more  likely the 
20 network of  syringe exchange  programs will continue to deteriorate; and
21 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
22 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
23 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
24 therefore,
25 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
26 Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 
27 allocations are made.
