SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 678, L.D. 1809, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Laws Governing the Issuance of Burn Penni ts" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, under current law, anyone perfonning out-of-door burning is required to 
obtain a permit from the town forest fire warden or from the forest ranger having 
jurisdiction over the location where the fire is to be set; and 
Whereas, until recently, as a convenience to the residents of the State, burn permits 
were available online and at no charge through a 3rd-party provider; and 
Whereas, due to a change in interpretation of policy by the Commissioner of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, residents of the State are no longer able to get 
free online bum permits; and 
Whereas, the burn permits issued online by the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry cost $7 per pennit; and 
Whereas, in order to restore to the residents of the State the convenience of 
obtaining burn permits online and at no charge, it is necessary that this legislation take 
effect as soon as possible; and 
Whereas, it is necessary for public safety that all burn permits are validly issued 
pursuant to statutory criteria in order to prevent wildfires, damage to property and hann 
to persons; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,'

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to allow municipalities to use third­
party internet based software to issue bum pennits so long as the software meets statutory requirements and is 
approved by ACF. The bill eliminates the $7 fee ACF charged for electronically issued bum pern1its via their online 
pennit system. Cunently, $4 is deposited into the General Fund, $2 is transferred to the municipality where the pennit 
was issued and $1 goes to InforME for the administrative cost of the online pennit system. In unorganized areas, $6 of 
the fee is deposited into the General Fund and $1 is for the administrative costs ofinforME. Beginning in fiscal year 
2018-19, elimination of the fee will reduce annual General Fund revenue by $43, 13 9, reduce revenue to municipalities 
by approximately $20,000 a year and reduce revenue available to pay InforME by $9,600. The bill includes an 
ongoing General Fund appropriation to ACF of $9,600 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 to continue to pay InforME 
for bum pe1111its issued through the state online system.
