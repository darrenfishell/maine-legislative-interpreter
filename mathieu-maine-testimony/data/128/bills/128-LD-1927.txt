Page 1 - 128LR3096(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the integrity of the unemployment compensation system has been  
4 grievously eroded by the recent enactment of  Public Law 2017, chapter 453; and
5 Whereas, as a result  of this recently  enacted  law, Maine businesses will be forced to 
6 pay oppressive,  higher taxes in order  to stabilize the State's  account in the federal 
7 Unemployment Trust Fund;  and
8 Whereas, immediate legislative action is necessary  to eliminate  the negative  
9 consequences of Public Law 2017, chapter 453; and
10 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
13 therefore,
14 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
15 Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §1192, sub-§3,  as amended by PL 2017, c. 453, §1, is further 
16 amended to read:
17 3.  Is able and available  for work.  The individual is able to work and is available 
18 for full-time work  at the individual's usual or customary trade, occupation,  profession  or 
19 business or in such other  trade,  occupation, profession  or business for which  the 
20 individual's prior  training or experience shows  the individual to be fitted or qualified, as 
21 long as the geographic region in which the work will take place is not greater than 35 
22 miles from  the individual's primary residence ; and in addition to having  complied  with 
23 subsection 2 is actively seeking work  in accordance with the regulations  of the 
24 commission; provided that no ineligibility may be found  solely because the claimant is 
25 unable to accept employment on a shift, the greater  part of which falls between  the hours 
26 of midnight to 5 a.m.,  and is unavailable for that employment  because of parental 
27 obligation, the need to care for an immediate  family member or the unavailability  of a 
28 personal care attendant required to assist  the unemployed individual  who is a 
29 handicapped person; and provided that an unemployed individual who is neither able nor 
30 available for work due to good cause  as determined by the deputy is eligible  to receive  
31 prorated benefits for that portion of the week during which  the individual was able and 
32 available.
33 A.  Notwithstanding this subsection, beginning January  1, 2004, an individual who is 
34 not available  for full-time work as required in this subsection is not disqualified from 
35 receiving benefits if:
36 (1)  The individual worked less than full time for a majority of the weeks  during  
37 that individual's base period and the individual is able and available for and 
38 actively seeking part-time  work for at least the number of hours in a week 
39 comparable to those customarily worked in part-time employment  during that 
40 individual's base period; or
Page 2 - 128LR3096(01)-11 (2)  The individual worked full time for a majority of the weeks  during that 
2 individual's base period,  but is able and available for and actively seeking only 
3 part-time work because of the illness or disability of an immediate family  
4 member or because of limitations necessary for the safety  or protection of the 
5 individual or  individual's immediate family member.
6 Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §1192, sub-§12,  as amended by PL 2017, c. 453, §2, is further 
7 amended to read:
8 12.  Participation in reemployment services.  The individual who has been referred  
9 to reemployment services, pursuant to a profiling system established  by the 
10 commissioner, participates in those services  or similar services unless it is determined 
11 that the individual has completed those services  or there is good cause  for the individual's 
12 failure to participate;  and
13 Sec. 3.  26 MRSA §1192, sub-§13,  as amended by PL 2017, c. 453, §3, is further

16 that the individual  has been referred to reemployment services and eligibility  assessment 
17 by the Department of Labor,  the individual  participates  in those  services, unless the 
18 department determines  there  is good cause  for the individual's failure to participate.  
19 Failure to participate in reemployment services and eligibility assessment  without good 
20 cause results in  a denial of benefits until the individual participates; and .
21 Sec. 4.  26 MRSA  §1192, sub-§14, as  enacted  by PL 2017,  c. 453, §4, is repealed.
22 Sec. 5.  26 MRSA §1192, last ¶, as amended  by PL 2017, c. 453, §5, is further  
23 amended to read:
24 For purposes of subsections  2, 3, 12 and 13, "good  cause" means the unemployed  
25 individual is ill; the presence of the unemployed individual is required due to an illness of 
26 the unemployed individual's  spouse, children, parents,  stepparents, brothers or sisters, or 
27 relatives who have been acting in the capacity  of a parent of either the unemployed 
28 individual or the unemployed  individual's spouse; the unemployed  individual is in 
29 attendance at the funeral of such a relative; the unemployed individual  is observing a 
30 religious holiday as required by religious conviction; the unemployed  individual is 
31 performing either a military or civil duty as required by law; or other  cause of a 
32 necessitous and compelling nature, including child care emergencies and transportation  
33 emergencies.  If an unemployed individual has completed reemployment services  and 
34 eligibility assessment with the Department of Labor within  the prior 5 years, that 
35 individual is considered to have good cause  for not participating in reemployment 
36 services and eligibility  assessment under subsections  12 and 13.  "Good cause" does not 
37 include incarceration as a result of a conviction for a  felony  or misdemeanor.
38 Sec. 6.  PL 2017, c.  453, §6 is repealed.
