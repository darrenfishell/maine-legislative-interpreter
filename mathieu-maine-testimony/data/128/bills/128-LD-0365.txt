SUMMARY  17 
Current law requires the court to order a criminal background check of each 18 
prospective adoptive parent of a child who is the subject of an adoption petition, except if 19 
the petitioner is a bi ological parent of the child.  This bill removes the requirement that 20 
the court order a criminal background check of a parent of the child who is not the 21 
biological parent.  22
