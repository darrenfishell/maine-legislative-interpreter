SUMMARY  29 
This bill clarifies existing law that permits a person that is licensed to manufacture 30 
malt liquor, wine or spirits at a facility in the State to sell the product th at person 31 
produces from the manufacturing facility for off -premises consumption without having to 32 
get a separate off -premises retail license.  The bill specifies that the location of the 33 
manufacturing facility where off -premises sales of the manufacturer's  product occur is not 34 
required to be accessed by a separate entrance from the area of the facility that is licensed 35 
to serve alcoholic beverages for on -premises consumption.  It also clarifies that 36 
distilleries and small distilleries are subject to the exi sting law that requires spirits sold at 37 
retail to first be listed for sale and distributed by the State.  38
