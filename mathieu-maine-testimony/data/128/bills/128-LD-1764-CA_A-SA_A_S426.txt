Business and Entrepreneurship Commission in place of the Commissioner of Economic 
and Community Development or the commissioner's designee. The amendment retains 
the provisions of the bill that relocate the Regulatory Fairness Board from the Department 
of the Secretary of State to the Department of Economic and Community Development.

an appropriations and allocations section.

This amendment designates the Director of the Office of Small Business and Entrepreneurship as the Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship Special Advocate within the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) 
and establishes an effective date of February 1, 2019. The incremental impact of delaying the effective date is a 
General Fund savings of$39,535 and a Highway Fund cost of$39,852 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
As amended, the bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $27,018 to the Maine Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Commission program within DECD for one Public Service Manager 1 position to serve as the 
Director of the Office of Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Special 
Advocate. The full-year cost of the position is estimated to be $104,406 in fiscal year 2019-20 and $107,074 in fiscal 
year 2020-21. 
As amended, the bill also includes a General Fund deappropriation of $27,018 and a Highway Fund deallocation of 
$28,470 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Secretary of State due to the Special Advocate position being 
transferred to D BCD.
