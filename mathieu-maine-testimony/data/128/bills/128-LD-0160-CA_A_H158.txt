factors, is likely to require significantly more costs than those listed on Table I, the 
commissioner may designate that application as subject to special fees. Such a 
designation must be made at, or prior to, the time the application is accepted as complete 
and may not be based solely on the likelihood of extensive public controversy. The

including, but not limited to, preapplication consultations, shall submit quarterly reports 
to the commissioner detailing the time spent on the application and all expenses 
attributable to the application, including the costs of any appeals filed by the applicant 
and, after taking into consideration the interest of fairness and equity, any other appeals if 
the commissioner fmds it in the public interest to do so. Any appeal filed by the applicant 
of an application fee must be to the agency of jurisdiction of the application. The costs 
associated with assistance to the board on an appeal before the board may be separately 
charged. The processing fee for that application must be the actual cost to the 
department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Marine Resources. The 
processing fee must be distributed to each department that incurs a cost to be deposited in 
the account in which the expenses were incurred in that department to reimburse the 
actual cost to that department. The applicant must be billed quarterly and all fees paid 
prior to receipt of the permit. At the time of the quarterly billing by the department, the 
commissioner shall review the ongoing work of the department to identify, prevent and 
mitigate undue delays or vague requirements of the application processing. Nothing in 
this section limits the commissioner's authority to enter into an agreement with an 
applicant for payment of costs in excess of the maximum fee established in this 
subsection.

annual waste discharge fees pursuant to section 353-B, a processing fee must be paid at 
the time of filing the application. Failure to pay the processing fee at the time of filing 
the application results in the application being returned to the applicant. One-half the 
processing fee assessed in section 352, subsection 5-A for licenses issued for a 10-year 
term must be paid at the time of filing the application. The remaining 1/2 of the 
processing fee for licenses issued for a 10-year tetm must be paid 5 years after issuance 
of the license. The commissioner may not refund the processing fee if the application is 
denied by the board or the commissioner. E1£eept as provided in section 352, sabseetion

application prior to the withdrawal of the application must be calculated, and the 
remainder of the processing fee not expended or committed must be refunded.

permit required pursuant to article 5-A is a permit-by-rnle or general permit, or separate 
orders are requested by the applicant and approved by the department. 
A storm water permit pursuant to this section is not required for a project receiving 
review by a registered municipality pursuant to section 489-A if the storm water 
ordinances under which the project is reviewed are at least as stringent as the storm water 
standards adopted pursuant to section 484 or if the municipality meets the requirements 
of section 489-A, subsection 2-A, paragraph B. 
Sec. 8. 38 MRSA §480-D, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §15 and

3. Harm to habitats; fisheries. The activity will not unreasonably harm any 
significant wildlife habitat, freshwater wetland plant habitat, threatened or endangered 
plant habitat, aquatic or adjacent upland habitat, travel conidor, freshwater, estuarine or 
marine fisheries or other aquatic life. 
In detenni-ning vmether mining, as defined i-n seotion 4 90 14M, subsection 11, •Nill 
OOlllflly with this subsection, the department shall reviev1 a-n analysis of alternatives 
submitted by the applicant. For purposes of this subsection, a practicable alternative to 
mining, as defined in section 4 90 ,M}.4, subsection 11, that is less damaging to the 
environment is not oonsidered to exist. The department may consider alternafr1es 
associated with the acti>1ity, i-ncludi-ng alternati>,re design a-nd operational measures, i-n its 
e>,raluation of •i1mether the acfr1ity avoided and minimized impacts to the maximum extent 
practicable. 
In determining whether there is unreasonable harm to significant wildlife habitat, the 
department may consider proposed mitigation if that mitigation does not diminish in the 
vicinity of the proposed activity the overall value of significant wildlife habitat and 
species utilization of the habitat and if there is no specific biological or physical feature 
unique to the habitat that would be adversely affected by the proposed activity. For 
purposes of this subsection, 11mitigation11 means any action taken or not taken to avoid, 
minimize, rectify, reduce, eliminate or compensate for any actual or potential adverse 
impact on the significant wildlife habitat, including the following: 
A. A voiding an impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 
B. Minimizing an impact by limiting the magnitude, duration or location of an 
activity or by controlling the timing of an activity; 
C. Rectifying an impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected 
environment; 
D. Reducing or eliminating an impact over time through preservation and 
maintenance operations during the life of the project; or 
E. Compensating for an impact by replacing the affected significant wildlife habitat. 
Sec. 9. 38 MRSA c. 3, sub-c. 1, art. 9, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 653, §23, is 
repealed.

The bill would prohibit the Department ofEnviromnental Protection (DEP) from issuing a permit for metallic mineral 
mining under the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act by repealing the statute. The repeal would eliminate any 
potential permit fee revenue from accruing to the Metallic Mining Fund within the DEP. The repeal would also 
generate savings from elimination of any costs associated with the DEP's pennitting process.
