 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §4401, sub -§4, ¶D -6, as amended by PL 2013, c. 126, §1, 2 
is further amended to read:  3 
D-6.    A division accomplished by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners 4 
of la nd abutting that land does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this 5 
definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this 6 
subchapter.  If the real estate exempt under this paragraph is transferred within 5 7 
years to ano ther person without all of the merged land, then the previously exempt 8 
division creates a lot or lots for the purposes of this subsection.  9 
SUMMARY  10 
This bill amends the law that defines a "subdivision."  Current law provides that a 11 
subdivision is not create d by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners of land 12 
abutting that land, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of the law 13 
governing subdivisions.  The provision, however, qualifies this exclusion and provides 14 
that a subd ivision is created if the land that was transferred is again transferred within 5 15 
years to another person without all of the merged land; this bill removes this additional 16 
qualification.  17
