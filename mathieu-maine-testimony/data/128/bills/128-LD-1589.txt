39 SUMMARY 
Part A 
moves the point of taxation with r espect to leases of tangible personal property 
from a use tax on the lessor to a sales tax on each lease payment, in order to simplify the law and provide consistency with the tax treatme nt of leases in other states that impose a 
sales tax. 
It updates the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, Part 3 to include leases, rentals and 
lessors in many existing provisions regardi ng sales and sellers and to add new provisions 
regarding leases, rentals and lessors that corr espond to existing provisions regarding sales 
and sellers.  It also updates sales tax exempti ons that currently exempt sales to certain 
entities to also exempt leases and rentals to those entities. 
It sources the first lease or rental payment to this State for taxation when the property 
is received in this State.  Subsequent paym ents are sourced to this State as long as the 
primary property location for the period cove red by the payment is in this State. 
It clarifies the exemption for historical so cieties, museums and incorporated nonprofit 
memorial foundations. 
It applies to sales occurring, and lease or rental agreements executed, on or after 
January 1, 2018.

provisions, enacting a clear 90-day standard fo r use in Maine to give rise to a use tax 
liability.  It applies to sales occurring, and lease or rental agreements executed, on or after 
January 1, 2018. 
Part C terminates, as of December 31, 2017, the ability to claim an excise tax 
reimbursement for rental vehicles.
