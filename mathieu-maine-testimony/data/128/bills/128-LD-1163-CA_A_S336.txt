Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget does not include funding for the June 2018 election. The department would require a 
General Fund appropriation of $155,000 to cover the costs of producing and delivering the ballots and the Citizen's 
Guide to the Referendum Election. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The Finance Authority of Maine estimates its cost to establish and operate the Student Debt Cancellation and 
Refinance Program to be between $120,000 and $160,000 per year, or between 3% and 4%, assuming annual bond 
activity of $4,000,000 per year over the 10 year period. Because this legislation provides that a portion of the bond 
monies may be used for administrative costs, no General Fund appropriations are required.
