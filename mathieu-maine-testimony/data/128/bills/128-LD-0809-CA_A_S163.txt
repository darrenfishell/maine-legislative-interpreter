15 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the

17 application process and to adopt standards to address evaluation criteria based on need for 
18 funding assistance for alternative breakfast delivery services in school administrative 
19 units. It also removes the requirement that the department develop a means to track

23 administrative unit with a public school in which at least 50% of students qualified for a 
24 free or reduced-price lunch during the preceding school year to operate an alternative 
25 breakfast delivery service that provides breakfast after the start of the school day and that 
26 provide a process for a school administrative unit to opt out of the alternative breakfast 
27 delivery service.
