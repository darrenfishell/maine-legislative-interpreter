SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. The amendment makes the 
following changes to the law governing discontinuance of town ways. 
1. It requires that notice of a proposed discontinuance of a town way include 
information regarding the potential discontinuance or retention of a public easement, 
including maintenance obligations for and the right of access to the way under the 
discontinuance or retention of a public easement, and information regarding the rights of 
abutting property owners to enter into agreements regarding maintenance of and access to 
the discontinued way. 
2. It requires that for a proposed discontinuance of a town way abutted by property 
not otherwise accessible by a public way the municipal officers provide additional notice 
to abutting property owners regarding their right to create private easements. 
3. It prohibits the municipality from proceeding with discontinuance of a town way 
abutted by property not otherwise accessible by a public way unless the municipal 
officers have first given the additional notice to abutting property owners and allowed 
one year for the abutting property owners to grant easements that run with the title of the 
property owners' land for the purpose of allowing travel along that way for all abutting 
property owners and their lessees and guests. If after one year the abutting property 
owners have not created such private easements, the town may discontinue the way, but 
only if a public easement is retained. If after one year the abutting property owners have 
created such private easements, the town officers may proceed with discontinuance 
without retaining a public easement. 
4. It specifies that for a municipality in which the municipal legislative body is the 
town meeting, a vote on the order of discontinuance must be conducted at the next 
regularly scheduled annual town meeting. 
5. It provides that the above changes apply only to town ways not discontinu,ed as of 
October 1, 2018. 
The amendment also requires a seller of nonresidential real estate to provide the 
purchaser a property disclosure statement that includes information about any abandoned 
or discontinued roads, public easements or private roads on or abutting the property, if 
known by the seller. The disclosure must also include information about who is 
responsible for maintenance of such roads or easements, including any responsible road 
association, if known by the seller. It exempts certain property transfers that do not 
involve a traditional seller and purchaser from these requirements.
