The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill provides a 100% property tax exemption to veterans receiving a 100% service-connected disability and 
municipalities will receive reimbursement for 100% of their property tax loss from the State. The bill includes a 
General Fund appropriation of $11,200 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services to reimburse municipalities for 90% of the mandated administrative costs of implementing this exemption. 
Additional future General Fund appropriations will be needed beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 to reimburse 
municipalities for 100% of the exemption.
