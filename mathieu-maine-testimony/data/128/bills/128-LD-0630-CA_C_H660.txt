Expand Opportunities for Moose Permit Winners To Swap Their Permits"

'An Act To Prohibit Third Parties from Facilitating Transfers of Moose Permits for

summary and insetting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §11110, as repealed and replaced by PL 2015, c. 301, §14, is 
amended to read: 
§11110. Transfer of hunting areas or zones 
1. Transfer permitted. A person who has been assigned a designated hunting area, 
zone or season by the department for purposes of hunting a game animal may exchange 
that designated zone, area or season with another person assigned a different hunting 
zone, area or season for the same game animal for purposes of hunting that same game 
animal. The depmtment may assist in the exchange to ensure that the permit holders meet 
the requirements of section 10756, but the State bears no responsibility for enforcing the 
terms of the exchange between the permit holders. The commissioner may adopt rules to

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT,{_,; to H.P. 446, L.D. 630 
1 moose permits who are exchanging those permits pursuant to subsection 1. For purposes 
2 of this subsection, "facilitate for consideration" means to directly receive compensation or 
3 something of value solely as patt of an exchange of moose permits. A person who 
4 violates this subsection commits a Class E crime.' 
5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment, which is the majority rep01t of the committee, replaces the bill. 
7 Like the bill, the amendment repeals the prohibition on exchanging moose pennits 
8 between permit holders for consideration, but, unlike the bill, the amendment does not 
9 direct the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish an online transfer 
10 system for permits. The amendment clarifies that the State bears no responsibility for 
11 enforcing the terms of the exchange between the permit holders. The amendment also 
12 prohibits persons other than the holders of moose petmits who are exchanging those 
13 permits from facilitating the exchange for consideration and defines "facilitate for 
14 consideration" to mean to directly receive compensation or something of value solely as 
15 patt of the exchange of moose permits. The amendment establishes that a person who 
16 facilitates for consideration an exchange of moose permits commits a Class E crime.
