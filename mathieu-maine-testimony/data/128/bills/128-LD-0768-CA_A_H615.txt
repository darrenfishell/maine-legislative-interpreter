SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the 
provisions of the bill that establish comprehensive hunting licenses and comprehensive 
combination hunting and fishing licenses. The amendment also eliminates the provisions 
of the bill that allow the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or a clerk or 
other agent appointed by the commissioner to inquire of a license applicant which species 
the applicant intends to hunt under the license and to limit the license to the species 
specified. 
The amendment retains the provisions of the bill that eliminate all alien licenses and 
permits and that allow persons who are not citizens to purchase nonresident licenses and 
permits if they are not considered residents. 
The amendment adds an effective date of January 1, 2019.

This bill will eliminate all alien hunting and fishing licenses issued by the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife (IFW) and would allow persons who are not United States citizens to purchase nonresident hunting and 
fishing licenses instead. Starting January 1, 2019, the purchase of nonresident hunting and fishing licenses, which are 
less expensive than alien hunting and fishing licenses in all categories, will reduce General Fund revenue by $5,132 in 
fiscal year 2018-19 and by $10 ,264 annually thereafter.
