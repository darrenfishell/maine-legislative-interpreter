December 31, 2018, whichever is earlier. Part B also corrects an additional cross­
reference to the tax credit for disability income protection plans in the workplace. 
Part C makes the following corrections, which may be considered substantive. 
1. Sections 1 and 3 correct cross-references to the Maine Uniform Building and 
Energy Code. 
2. Section 2 corrects a formatting error in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act 
and makes grammatical changes. 
3. Sections 4, 5 and 6 amend the laws governing the condemnation of property for 
the construction or expansion of school buildings or playgrounds to provide authority to 
regional school units. 
4. Section 7 removes language that the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services intended to remove in the majority committee amendment to L.D. 454 of 
the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature, which was enacted by the Legislature. 
5. Sections 8, 9 and 10 amend the deadlines for local option petitions, filing written 
objections to nomination papers or caucus nomination certificates and candidate 
withdrawals, respectively, to be consistent with a change made in the First Regular 
Session of the 128th LegislatUl'e. 
6. Section 11 corrects a clerical error in the involuntary hospitalization statutes. 
7. Section 12 removes the application section of Public Law 2017, chapter 88, which 
refers to benefits paid to disability retirement benefit recipients, because the sections of 
the public law referenced do not refer to benefits paid. 
8. Section 13 provides a new allocation section for the Commission on 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices because of an error in Public Law 2017, 
chapter 284, Part ZZZZZZ, section 19 that resulted in a negative allocation for fiscal year 
2018-19. Section 13 provides an allocation of $3,976,470 to result in the correct
