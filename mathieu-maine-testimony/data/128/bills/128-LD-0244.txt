 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  12 MRSA ยง598, sub -ยง5, as amended by PL 2011, c. 278, ยง4 and c. 657, 2 
Pt. W, ยง5, is further amended to read:  3 
5.  Substantially altered.   "Substantially altered," in the use of designated lands, 4 
means changed so as to significantly alter physical characteristics in a way that frustrates 5 
the essential purposes for which that land is held by the State.  The essential purposes of 6 
state parks, historic sites, public access sites, facilities for  boats and the Allagash 7 
Wilderness Waterway are the protection, management and improvement of these 8 
properties for public recreation, conservation, scenic values, nature appreciation, historic 9 
preservation and interpretation, public access and related purp oses.  The essential 10 
purposes of public reserved and nonreserved lands are the protection, management and 11 
improvement of these properties for the multiple use objectives established in section 12 
1847.  The essential purposes of lands acquired through the Lan d for Maine's Future 13 
Board that are not held by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or by the 14 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry are the protection, management 15 
and improvement of those lands for recreation, conservation, farmi ng, open space, plant 16 
and animal habitat, scenic values, public access and related purposes.  The essential 17 
purposes of state -owned wildlife management areas and game farms are the protection, 18 
management and improvement of those properties for fish and wil dlife habitat and 19 
propagation, hunting, trapping, fishing, recreation, propagation and harvesting of forest 20 
and other natural products and related purposes. "Substantially altered" does not mean the 21 
conveyance of an access right by easement in accordance w ith section 1814 -A.  For the 22 
purposes of this chapter, the use of designated lands for the mining of minerals, as those 23 
terms are defined in section 549 -A, subsections 6 and 7, constitutes a substantial 24 
alteration in use.  25 
SUMMARY  26
