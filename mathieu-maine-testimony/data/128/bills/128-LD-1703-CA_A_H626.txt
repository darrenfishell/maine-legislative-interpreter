Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would create a uniform refund value of 5¢ for all returnable beverage containers starting March 1, 2019. 
Because the bottle redemption program is included in the spirits administration contract with Pine State Trading 
Company, this change would require an addendum to the cmrent contract. As a result of the new redemption value, 
the spirits contract vendor would be required to phase in new redemption stickers and to affix new redemption stickers 
to any remaining invent01y in stock that was purchased prior to, and that remained unsold on, March 1, 2019. 
Additionally, because the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations acts as the initiator of deposits on 
Spirits purchased under the spirits contract, the bureau will be required to reimburse agency liquor stores fo;r the cost 
difference between the deposits on spirits purchased before March 1, 2019 and the refund value on those same 
purchases still unsold or returned after that date. The bill includes a one-time allocation of $60,000 in fiscal year 2018-
19 to reimburse agency liquor stores. It is anticipated that the Alcoholic Beverages Fund will have sufficient revenue 
to fund the allocation. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection as a result of changes to the redemption value are 
anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
