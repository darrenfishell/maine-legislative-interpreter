Fiscal Note 
Redistribution of state subsidy -Local school administrative units 
This legislation repeals the sections of current law that set the per-pupil amounts for system administration to be 
allocated to school administrative units (SAU's) in fiscal year 2019-20 and instead holds the per-pupil amounts at the 
2018-19 level for fiscal year 2019-20 and beyond. 
Lowering the per-pupil allocation for system administration for fiscal year 2019-20 by $3 (from 141 to $138) will 
reduce the total system administration allocation versus current law. Assuming student enrollment of 180,000 in 
fiscal year 2019-20, the total system administration allocation would be approximately $540,000 lower than what it 
would be under current law. Changing the per-pupil allocation amounts to be allocated to SAU's for system 
administration (from $47 to $92) and SAU's that have established regionalized adminstrative services pursuant to Title 
20-A, chapter 123 (from $94 to $46 and now including high-performing, efficient SAU's) will result in a redistribution 
of state subsidy, with some SAU's receiving more subsidy than would have been received absent this legislation and 
some SAU's receiving less. The impact to individual SAU's can not be determined.
