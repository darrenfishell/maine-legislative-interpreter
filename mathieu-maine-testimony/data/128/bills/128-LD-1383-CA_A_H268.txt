128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 962, L.D. 1383, "RESOLUTION, 
Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Regarding Early Voting" 
Amend the resolution in that part designated "Constitution, Art. II, §4" in Section 4 
by striking out all of the 2nd sentence (page 1, lines 8 to 11 in L.D.) and inserting the 
following: 'The Legislature by proper enactment may authorize a process by which 
municipalities may conduct early voting by allowing voters to vote in the same manner as 
on election day during a prescribed period immediately preceding an election.' 
Amend the resolution by striking out all of the question (page 1, lines 23 to 27 in 
L.D.) and insetting the following: 
111Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to allow the 
Legislature to authorize a process by which a municipality may conduct 
early voting in the same manner as on election day during a period 
immediately preceding an election?'" 
SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the provision of the constitutional resolution allowing early 
voting to provide that the Legislature may authorize a process by which municipalities 
may conduct early voting by allowing voters to vote in the same manner as on election 
day during a period immediately preceding an election. The amendment retains the 
provision of the resolution that allows absentee voting for any sufficient reason.
