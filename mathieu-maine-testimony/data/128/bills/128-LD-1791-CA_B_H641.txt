SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the conunittee, establishes an 
executive conunittee of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative to take certain 
actions on behalf of the collaborative and specifies which actions are prohibited. The 
amendment retains the provision in the bill that removes the October 1, 2018 repeal of the 
section of law that establishes the collaborative and instead changes the repeal date to 
October 1, 2021. The amendment continues through 2021 the surcharge amounts on 
various types of licenses to fund the collaborative that have been in place since 2016, 
except that this amendment makes those surcharges voluntary for years 2019 to 2021. 
The amendment directs the Conunissioner of Marine Resources to investigate whether 
the surcharges assessed on a wholesale seafood license with lobster permits or a 
supplemental lobster transportation license may be amended to reflect the amount of 
lobster bought, sold, shipped or transported by the license holder or a class of license 
holders and to provide a report ofreconunendations to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over marine resources matters by January 15, 2019.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would make the license surcharges used to fund the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative (MLMC) 
voluntary for fiscal year 2018-19 through fiscal year 2020-21 and would prevent the Department of Marine Resources 
(DMR) from refusing to issue any license based upon an applicant's nonpayment of the surcharge. This would reduce 
the annual revenue to the MLMC for the number of applicants who opt-out of paying the surcharges. Using fiscal 
year 2017 as a baseline and assuming a 50% opt-out rate the first year and a 75% rate subequently, this revenue 
reduction would be $1,059,611 in fiscal year 2018-19 and $1,589,417 in each of the next two fiscal years. Such a 
reduction would greatly limit the ability of the MLMC to continue marketing activities past the current fiscal year. 
Any additional costs to the DMR and the MLMC as a result of changes to the organizational strncture of the MLMC, 
the tirneline for operations of the MLMC and the requirements that DMR investigate and report on possible changes 
to certain license surcharges used to fund the MLMC are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
