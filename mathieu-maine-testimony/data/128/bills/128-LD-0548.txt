 SUMMARY  1 
This bill adds to the law regarding pulling events the requirement that an animal 2 
entered in a pulling event must have either an ear tag or a microchip implant for 3 
identification purpo ses. 4 
The bill also removes references to trainers as regards pulling events.  It requires the 5 
Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to impose a 2 -year suspension 6 
from competition for a person found to have used a prohibited substance with respect to 7 
an animal at a pulling event.  It requires the commissioner to impose a full one -year 8 
suspension from competition for the animal found to have a prohibited substance in its 9 
system at the time of the pulling event.  Currently, the commissioner ma y impose a 10 
suspension of less than 2 years.  11
