Fiscal Note 
Current biennium revenue decrease -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Providing veterans with free admission to the Maine State Museum for the lifetime of the veteran will result in less 
dedicated revenue being received by the Maine State Museum from admission fees than would have been received 
had this provision not been in place. The museum has estimated the revenue loss at $2,500 annually. 
Additional costs to the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management associated with issuing free 
museum passes to qualifying veterans can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
