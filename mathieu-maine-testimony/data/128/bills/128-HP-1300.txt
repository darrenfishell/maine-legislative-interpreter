JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE STATE'S CREDIT UNI ONS 
 
 WHEREAS,  Maine's credit unions are member-owned and member-o perated financial 
cooperatives with an unwavering commitment to servi ng the needs of their members and 
communities.  The nonprofit structure of credit uni ons provides each member with an equal 
voice and representation in the operations of the c redit union.  Serving members in all 16 Maine 
counties and in every community, Maine's credit uni ons are focused on the needs of their 
member owners with the primary purpose of benefitin g the nearly 700,000 Maine consumers 
who use credit unions; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the economic benefit that Maine's credit unions pro vide to Maine consumers 
is approximately $50,000,000 annually, as a result of lower and fewer fees on products and 
services, lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on savings; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  Maine is ranked as the nation's 5th strongest credi t union state based on the 
percentage of population that uses a credit union, a position Maine has held for 15 consecutive 
years, and credit unions serve more than half the r esidents of the State; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the 2,250 full-time and part-time employees of Main e's credit unions and 
the more than 1,000 unpaid volunteers who serve on credit union boards and committees 
demonstrate the core credit union values, philosoph y and mission of people helping people by 
contributing to the communities they serve, not jus t with financial services but by fostering a 
spirit that strengthens communities; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  since 1990 Maine's credit unions and their members have raised over 
$8,000,000 to help end hunger in Maine, including a  record-setting $740,000 in 2017.  One 
hundred percent of all money that is raised through  the Maine Credit Unions' Campaign for 
Ending Hunger stays in Maine and goes directly to a ssist thousands of Maine families and 
individuals who otherwise would go hungry.  In addi tion to contributing thousands of dollars to 
food pantries in communities across the State, Main e's credit unions also help to provide funds 
for statewide initiatives to help end hunger, such as being the primary source of funding for the 
State's first Food Mobile, which has delivered more  than 5,200,000 pounds of food to food 
pantries in every Maine county since 2005; and
