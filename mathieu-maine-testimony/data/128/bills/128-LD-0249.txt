 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, Maine is experiencing a dramatic increase in opioid overdose deaths; and  3 
Whereas, research  has demonstrated that, although they are not the only source, 4 
physicians are the leading source of prescription painkillers for persons at high risk for 5 
painkiller overdose; and  6 
Whereas, research suggests that the Maine Diversion Alert Program helps 7 
presc ribers make informed decisions and improves prescribing practices; and  8 
Whereas, the Maine Opiate Collaborative's Law Enforcement Task Force 9 
recommends improving intelligence gathering and sharing among law enforcement 10 
agencies to include local, county, sta te and federal entities; and  11 
Whereas, the Maine Diversion Alert Program is the only statewide drug charge 12 
database that includes the majority of local, county, state and federal drug -related arrests 13 
made in Maine; and  14 
Whereas, the Maine Diversion Alert Pro gram can be enhanced to create a resource 15 
for law enforcement that improves intelligence gathering and sharing among local, 16 
county, state and federal agencies; and  17 
Whereas, the Maine Diversion Alert Program requires additional funding in fiscal 18 
year 2017 -18 and fiscal year 2018 -19 and beyond to maintain the program statewide; and  19 
Whereas, this legislation provides funds for the Maine Diversion Alert Program 20 
during fiscal year 2017 -18 and fiscal year 2018 -19; and  21 
Whereas, in order for the funds to be availab le in fiscal year 2017 -18, this 22 
legislation needs to take effect before the start of that fiscal year; and  23 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 24 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the followin g legislation as 25 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 26 
therefore,  27 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  28 
Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 29 
allocations are made.  30
