Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Changes made in this legislation regarding how benefits paid to an eligible individual under the Employment Security 
Law are charged against the experience rating record of the individual's previous employers will have no fiscal impact 
on the Unemployment Trust Fund or the employer contribution rate schedule currently in effect. However, the 
Department of Labor will incur one-time Federal Expenditures Fund costs of approximately $900,000 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to make the necessary programming updates in order to implement the change. The Department has indicated 
that it has federal funds available for this purpose. 
Additional costs to the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation within the Department of Labor to provide the 
required alternate option to the web-based system for filing initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits, 
including such options as telephone or in-person can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
