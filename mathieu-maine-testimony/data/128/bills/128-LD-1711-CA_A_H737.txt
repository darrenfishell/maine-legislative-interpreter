and sustaining recovery, minimize the risk of opiate poisoning among participants and 
decrease the likelihood of diversion ofbuprenorphine by increasing participants' access to 
stable and supportive housing, connecting participants with the recovery community and 
its resources and providing participants with a safe environment in which the participants 
can identify individualized short-term and long-term goals and develop new skills to 
support their recovery. 
2. Participant eligibility and recruitment. To participate in the pilot project, an 
individual must be an individual who is experiencing homelessness, have a history of 
drug overdose and meet the criteria for physiological dependence on opioids in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, published by the 
American Psychiatric Association. The pilot project must give priority to individuals 
who are being discharged from incarceration or long-term hospitalization due to 
complications related to substance use disorder. 
The pilot project must include intensive outreach using a collaborative team case review 
approach to identify and recruit participants. An individual selected for the pilot project 
shall sign a written agreement that explains the requirements for pilot project 
participation and authorizes initiation of case management and treatment services as well

regarding the participant's progress in recovery and in attaining individual goals. 
Participants shall also complete initial assessments regarding substance use disorder, 
physical health and psychosocial and psychiatric needs as soon as possible. 
3. Pilot project components. Although a lead provider may adapt the structure of 
the pilot project to meet the needs of the rural area or urban area it serves, the pilot 
project must include medication-assisted treatment, intensive case management and 
immediate access to stable housing as described in this subsection. 
A. The pilot project must provide participants with medication-assisted treatment in 
accordance with this paragraph that is initiated within 48 hours of each participant's 
enrollment in the pilot project. The pilot project must seek reimbursement from 
MaineCare for medication-assisted treatment services whenever possible. The lead 
provider or partner provider shall employ a medical professional authorized to 
prescribe for each participant a medication approved by the federal Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of substance use disorder that, in the professional's 
opinion, is most appropriate given the participant's current medications, substance use 
and medical history. The authorized prescriber shall take primary responsibility for 
managing and refilling the prescription. 
The lead provider or partner provider shall establish a collaborative, interagency 
staffing model of medication-assisted treatment that includes, to the extent resources 
permit, the authorized prescriber, a nurse care manager, a licensed clinical social 
worker or licensed alcohol and drug counselor, a certified psychiatric mental health 
nurse practitioner and a peer support specialist who meet regularly to plan participant 
services, review participant progress and implement reenrollment strategies when

12 to address the physical and behavioral health needs of participants and support their 
13 compliance with medication-assisted treatment and other services necessary to

16 team that includes, to the extent resources permit, an intensive case management

practicable, the transition liaison shall ensure that participants have access to housing 
immediately upon discharge from a correctional or medical facility. 
C. The pilot project shall provide participants with immediate and continued access 
to stable housing that promotes recovery, independence and harm reduction. The 
intensive case management team shall identify appropriate housing placements for 
participants that may include, but are not limited to, housing first developments, 
recovery residences, private nonmedical institutions and private apartments. The 
intensive case management team shall collaborate with local housing authorities, 
affordable housing developers, municipal general assistance offices and housing 
voucher administrators to provide pilot project participants with priority in accessing 
these programs. 
The lead provider or a partner provider shall administer a housing assistance fund to 
provide participants with immediate access to stable housing. The housing assistance 
fund must contain sufficient capital to provide all pilot project participants with 5 
months of rent at fair market value based on the location of the pilot project. The 
lead provider or partner provider may provide a participant with more or less than 5 
months of financial assistance from the housing assistance fund, depending on the 
participant's individual need for financial assistance to achieve housing stability. 
While participants receive financial assistance from the housing assistance fund, the 
intensive case management team shall assist pa1ticipants in securing an alternative 
financial resource or resources for housing, including but not limited to employment,

4. Participant discharge criteria. A participant may withdraw from the pilot 
project at any time. The lead provider or a partner provider shall reevaluate each 
participant's enrollment in the pilot project every month. A participant may receive 
services from the pilot project for the length of time necessary for the participant to 
successfully complete the project or to transition to a less intensive model of treatment 
when considered clinically appropriate. In determining whether a participant has 
successfully completed the project or may transition to a less intensive model of 
treatment, the lead provider or partner provider shall consider the participant's sustained 
abstinence from illegal substance and alcohol use, employment or involvement in other 
meaningful community activities, psychosocial supports and willingness to participate in 
further treatment to maintain recovery. 
Alternatively, a participant may be discharged from the pilot project if the lead provider 
or a partner provider determines that the pilot project is unable to provide appropriate 
services due to the participant's physical or mental health or continued illegal substance 
use; and be it further
