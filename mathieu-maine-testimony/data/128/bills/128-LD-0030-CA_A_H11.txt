23 This amendment replaces the bill. Current law states that a person licensed to serve 
24 alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises must prohibit, with some 
25 limited exceptions, music, dancing and entertainment unless the licensee has received a 
26 special amusement permit from the municipality where the establishment is located. The

28 entertainment based on what is permitted or prohibited by local ordinance or regulation. 
29 The amendment fmther specifies that when the liquor license is up for renewal a 
30 municipality may deny renewal if the establishment fails to obtain a required permit or 
31 fails to comply with the permit. The amendment removes certain requirements imposed 
32 upon the municipality governing the process for issuance of a permit for music, dancing 
3 3 or entertainment.
