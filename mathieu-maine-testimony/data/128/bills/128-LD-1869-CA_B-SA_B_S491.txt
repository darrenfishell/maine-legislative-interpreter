from the existing bargaining units of teachers and other employees who are employed by 
each member school unit and merged into units of school management and leadership 
center employees. Merger into school management and leadership center-wide 
bargaining units is not subject to approval or disapproval of employees. Formation of 
school management and leadership center-wide bargaining units must occur in 
accordance with this subsection. 
A. In each school management and leadership center, there must be one unit of 
!eachers, if any teachers are employed by the school management and leadership 
center, and, to the extent they are on the effective date of this paragraph included in 
:bargaining unit§__,_other certified professional employees, excluding principals and 
9ther administrators. 
B. Any additional bargaining units in a school management and leadership center 
must be structured as follows. 
(1) In the initial establishment of such units, units must be structured primarily 
on the basis of the existing pattern of organization, maintaining the grouping of 
employee classifications into bargaining units that existed prior to the creation of 
the school management and leadership center and avoiding conflicts among 
different bargaining a_gents to the extent possible. 
(2) In the event of a dispute regarding the classifications to be included within a 
school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit, the current 
bargaining agent or agents or the school management and leadership center may 
petition the Maine Labor Relations Board to determine the appropriate unit in 
acc9rdance with this section and Title 26, section 966, subsections 1 and 2. 
C. When there is the same bargaining agent in all bargaining units that will be 
merged into a school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit, the 
units must be separated and merged on the operational date or the date represented 
employees are transferred to the school management and leadership center, 
whichever is applicable, and the school management and leadership center shall 
recognize the bargaining agent as the representative of the merged unit. 
D. When all ~its that will be separated and merged into a school 
management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit are represented by separate 
local affiliates of the same state labor organization, the units must be separated and 
merged on the operational date or the date represented employees are transferred to 
the school management and leadership center, whichever is applicable. The identity 
of a single affiliate that will be designated the bargaining agent for the merged unit 
must be selected by the existing bargaining agents and the state labor organization. 
Upon completion of the merger and designation of the bargaining agent and 
notification by the state labor organization to the school management and leadership 
center, the school management and leadership center shall recognize the designated 
bµrgaining agent as the representative of employees in the merged unit. If necessary,

the parties shall then execute a written amendment to any collective bargaining 
agreement then in effect to change the name of the bargaining agent to reflect the 
merger. 
E. When there are bargaining units that will be separated and merged into a school 
management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit in which there are 
employees who are not represented by any bargaining agent and other employees 
who are represented either by the same bargaining agent or separate local affiliates of 
the same state labor organization, the units must be separated and merged on the 
operational date or the date represented employees are transferred to the school 
management and leadership center, whichever is applicable, as long as a majority of 
employees who compose the merged unit were represented by the bargaining aMill 
prior to the merger. The procedures for separation and merger of separate local 
affiliates of the same state labor organization described in paragraph D must be 
followed if applicable. If prior to the merger a bargaining agent did not represent a 
majority of employees who compose the merged unit, a bargaining agent election 
must be conducted by the Maine Labor Relations Board pursuant to paragraph F. 
F. When bargaining units with different bargaining agents must be merged into a 
single school management and leadership center-wide bargaining unit pursuant to this

bargaining units that will be merged into the school management and leadership 
center-wide bargaining unit and the choice of no representative, but no other 
choices. A showing of interest is not required from any such bargaining agent 
other than its current status as representative. 
( 4) The obligation to bargain with existing bargaining agents continues from the 
operational date of the school management and leadership center or the date on 
which positions are transferred from member school units to the school 
management and leadership center, whichever is later, until the determination of 
the bargaining agent of the school management and leadership center-wide 
bargaining unit under this section; but in no event may any collective bargaining 
agreement that is executed after the operational date extend beyond the first 
August 31st occun'ing after either the 3rd anniversary date of the operational date 
of the school management and leadership center or the date on which positions
