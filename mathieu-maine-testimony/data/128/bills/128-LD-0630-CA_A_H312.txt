1 are exchanging those permits pursuant to subsection 1. A person who violates this 
2 subsection commits a Class E crime.' 
3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment replaces the bill. The bill repeals the prohibition on transferring a 
5 moose permit for consideration and directs the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
6 Wildlife to establish an online transfer system for permits. The amendment removes the 
7 provision of the bill that directs the department to establish an online transfer system for 
8 permits, but, like the bill, the amendment repeals the prohibition on transferring moose 
9 permits for consideration. This amendment prohibits persons other than the holders of 
10 moose permits who are exchanging hunting zones, areas or seasons to facilitate the 
11 exchange for any consideration. The amendment establishes that a person who facilitates 
12 an exchange of moose permits commits a Class E crime. The amendment clarifies that the 
13 State bears no responsibility for enforcing the terms of an exchange between the permit 
14 holders.
