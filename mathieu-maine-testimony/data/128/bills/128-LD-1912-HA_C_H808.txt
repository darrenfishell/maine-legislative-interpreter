This amendment transfers $2,000,000 from the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) within the Commission on 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund within 10 days of the 
effective date of this bill. (This fiscal note assumes that will occur early in fiscal year 2018-19.) It is anticipated that 
this will leave a cash balance of approximately $2,600,000 in the MCEF. The amendment also reverses this 
transaction later in fiscal year 2018-19 by transferring, on or before January 1, 2019, $2,000,000 from the General 
Fund back to the MCEF. The amendment also includes a one-time $3,976,470 Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocation in fiscal year 2018-19 for the MCEF, to correct an enor in PL 2017, Chapter 284, Part ZZZZZZ, Section 
19, that resulted in a negative $1,010,665 Other Special Revenue Funds allocation in fiscal yem 2018-19. As 
amended, the MCEF may require additional allocation if the full amount of funding available in fiscal year 2018-19 is 
to be expended. That allocation will need to be provided either by additional legislative action or by financial order. 
For the November 2018 election only, this amendment also reduces the number of qualifying contributions that Maine 
Clean Elections Act candidates could collect from 9600 to 7200 for gubernatorial candidates, from 360 to 270 for 
State Senate candidates and from 120 to 90 for State House of Representative candidates. This will reduce anticipated 
payments to candidates by an estimated $499,850 in fiscal year 2018~19 from the MCEF. This amendment also voids 
any qualifying contributions made to a Maine Clean Election candidate on June 12, 2018 at a voting place.
