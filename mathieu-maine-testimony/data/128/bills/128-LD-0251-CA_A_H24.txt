detention. Violation of this paragraph is a Class D crime.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. This amendment clarifies 
the language in the bill regarding physical actions that constitute the crime of refusing to 
submit to arrest or detention to provide that a person who engages in a physical action 
that hinders, delays or prevents a lawful arrest or detention of the person is guilty of that 
crime. The amendment also provides that such a person is guilty of a Class D crime, 
rather than a Class E crime as proposed in the bill.
