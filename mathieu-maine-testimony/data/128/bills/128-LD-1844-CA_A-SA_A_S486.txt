far as is practicable and appropriate, significant forest land that is being sold, to ensure 
the protection of this economic and recreational state resource.'

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Limiting the State's right of first refusal to parcels of land for which an offer to purchase has been made by a person 
who is not a citizen of the United States would reduce the number of times the State would exercise that right. Any 
impacts described in the fiscal note for the committee amendment would be greatly reduced.
