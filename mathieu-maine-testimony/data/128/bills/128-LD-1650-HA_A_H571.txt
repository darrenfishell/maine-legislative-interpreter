This amendment further delays, until July 1, 2018, the effective date of those provisions of the Marijuana Legalization 
Act that were delayed until February 1, 2018 by Public Law 2017, chapter 1. After this amendment, and assuming 
sales will then not begin until January 1, 2019, the bill will reduce General Fund revenue from the tax on marijuana 
sales by $2,254,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $8,526,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. Local Govemment Fund revenue 
will be reduced by $46,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $174,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
As this amendment stdkes all of the bill in addition to imposing a delay, all appropriations and allocations and the 
transfer are removed from the bill and are shown above as being reversed. To date no additional funding for 
expenditures related to the implementation of the Marijuana Legalization Act (MLA) has been provided. This 
amendment will delay the need for that funding and additional legislation will still be required to fund the 
establishment of a regulated marketplace in the State for the adult use of marijuana under the Marijuana Legalization 
Act.
