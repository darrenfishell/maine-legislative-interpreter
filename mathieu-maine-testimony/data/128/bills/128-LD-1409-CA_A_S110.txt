18 businesses can provide; and 
19 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within

21 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now,

9 SUMMARY 
10 This amendment adds an emergency preamble and emergency clause to the bill. 
11 Unlike the bill, which applies to producers that manufacture or bottle no more than 
12 50,000 gallons of beverages annually, the amendment gives small nonalcoholic beverage 
13 producers that manufacture or bottle no more than 10,000 gallons of beverages annually 
14 flexibility in the method by which they clean and sanitize reusable glass beverage 
15 containers, as long as they use the required 3 % caustic alkali sanitizing solution. The 
16 amendment also permits small nonalcoholic beverage producers to bottle and carbonate 
17 their products by hand, rather than through the use of machinery, as long as all other 
18 sanitary requirements are met.
