 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง943, as amended by PL 2011, c. 104, ยง1, is repealed and the 2 
following enacted in its place:  3 
ยง943.  Tax lien mortgage; redemption; discharge; foreclosure  4 
1.  Tax lien mortgage.  The filing of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds 5 
creates a tax lien mortgage on that real estate to the municipality in which the real estate 6 
is situated having priority over all other mortgages, liens, attachments and encumbrances 7 
of any n ature and gives to that municipality all the rights usually incident to a mortgagee, 8 
except that the municipality does not have any right of possession of that real estate until 9 
the right of redemption has expired.  10 
The filing of the tax lien certificate in  the registry of deeds is sufficient notice of the 11 
existence of the tax lien mortgage.  12 
In the event that the tax, interest and costs underlying the tax lien are paid within the 13 
period of redemption, the municipal treasurer or assignee of record shall prepa re and 14 
record a discharge of the tax lien mortgage in the same manner as is provided for the 15 
discharge of real estate mortgages, except that a facsimile signature of the treasurer or 16 
treasurer's assignee may be used.  17 
If the tax lien mortgage, together with  interest and costs, is not paid within 18 months 18 
after the date of the filing of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds, the tax lien 19 
mortgage is deemed to have been foreclosed and the right of redemption to have expired.  20 
2.  Additional notice prior to foreclosure.  The municipal treasurer shall notify the 21 
party named on the tax lien mortgage and each record holder of a mortgage on the real 22 
estate not more than 45 days nor less than 30 days before the foreclosing date of the tax 23 
lien mortgage, i n a writing signed by the treasurer or bearing the treasurer's facsimile 24 
signature and left at the holder's last and usual place of abode or sent by certified mail, 25 
return receipt requested, to the holder's last known address of the impending automatic 26 
foreclosure and indicating the exact date of foreclosure.  For sending this notice, the 27 
municipality is entitled to receive $3 plus all certified mail, return receipt requested, fees.  28 
These costs must be added to and become a part of the tax.  If notice is n ot given in the 29 
time period specified in this subsection to the party named on the tax lien mortgage or to 30 
any record holder of a mortgage, the person not receiving timely notice may redeem the 31 
tax lien mortgage until 30 days after the treasurer does provi de notice in the manner 32 
specified in this section.  33 
The notice of impending automatic foreclosure must be substantially in the following 34 
form:  35

After the expiration of the 18 -month period for redemption, the mortgagee of reco rd of 16 
the real estate or the mortgagee's assignee and the owner of record if the real estate has 17 
not been assessed to the owner of record or the person claiming under the owner of 18 
record, in the event the notice provided for the mortgagee and owner has not  been given 19 
as provided in section 942, have the right to redeem the real estate within 3 months after 20 
receiving actual knowledge of the recording of the tax lien certificate by payment or 21 
tender of the amount of the tax lien mortgage, together with intere st and costs, and the tax 22 
lien mortgage is then discharged by the municipality in the manner provided.  23 
The tax lien mortgage is prima facie evidence in all courts in all proceedings by and 24 
against the municipality and its successors and assigns, of the tru th of the statements in 25 
the tax lien mortgage and, after the period of redemption has expired, of the title of the 26 
municipality to the real estate described in the tax lien mortgage and of the regularity and 27 
validity of all proceedings with reference to th e acquisition of title by the tax lien 28 
mortgage and the foreclosure.  29 
Whenever the person against whom the tax is assessed has died after the tax has been 30 
committed and prior to the expiration of the 18 -month period of foreclosure and that 31 
person has left a  will offered for probate, the probate judge of the county in which that 32 
will is offered upon petition of any devisee of the real estate on which the tax is unpaid 33 
may grant a period of redemption not to exceed 60 days following the final allowance or 34 
disallowance of that will. Notice of the petition must be given to the tax collector of the 35 
municipality in which the property is located, and a certified copy of the court order must 36 
be filed in the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is loc ated.  37

the contrary, the preforeclosure process described in this subsection applies only to 39 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR22 90(01) -1 
 owners 65 years of age or older.  After filing the tax lien mortgage and at least  90 days 1 
before the right of redemption expires, the municipality shall proceed as follows.  2 
A.  The municipality shall contact the owner and, with the owner's consent, assist the 3 
owner in applying for a tax abatement pursuant to section 841. The municipali ty shall 4 
make a good faith evaluation of the owner's eligibility for a tax abatement. If the 5 
owner is found eligible for a full abatement of the tax, the municipality shall 6 
discharge its lien. The municipality shall inform the owner of the option of seekin g a 7 
reverse mortgage.  8 
B.  If pursuant to paragraph A a partial abatement is granted or if the owner is found 9 
not eligible for an abatement, the municipality must offer the owner a reasonable 10 
repayment schedule. If the owner does not agree to the repayment schedule, the 11 
municipality must offer to engage in mediation with the goal of producing a mutually 12 
acceptable schedule. The municipality shall select the mediator and pay the 13 
mediator's fee, and one -half of the cost must be added to the amount owed by the 14 
owner. The mediator must be impartial and listed with the judicial branch. If 15 
mediation is successful, the right of redemption does not expire as long as the owner 16 
makes payments according to the mediation schedule.  17 
If a scheduled payment becomes delinquen t more than 18 months after the tax 18 
commitment date and remains delinquent for more than 30 days, the municipality 19 
shall send a notice of delinquency to the owner by certified mail, return receipt 20 
requested, that includes a statement that payment of the fu ll balance owed must be 21 
made within 14 days of receiving the notice of delinquency or the right of redemption 22 
will expire. If payment is not made by the 15th day, the right of redemption expires.  23 
The municipality shall confirm the date of expiration by fi ling a notice of the 24 
expiration date in the registry of deeds where the lien was filed. A copy of the notice 25 
must be given to the owner in hand or by certified mail, return receipt requested.  26 
C.  If at any time a municipal official or employee has a reaso nable suspicion that the 27 
owner has a physical or mental condition that interferes with the owner's ability to 28 
have business dealings with the municipality or that the owner is a victim of abuse, 29 
neglect, including self -neglect and neglect by another, or ex ploitation, the 30 
municipality shall notify the Department of Health and Human Services, office of 31 
elder and adult services, adult protective services program. The department shall 32 
determine whether the owner is in need of protective services or refer the ow ner to 33 
other community services that can assist the owner with the process described in this 34 
section.  35 
4.  Foreclosure and sale.  After the foreclosure process is completed and the right of 36 
redemption has expired, any sale of the property by the municipali ty must proceed as 37 
follows.  38 
A.  If an owner is 65 years of age or older and is living in the property and the 39 
property is the owner's sole residence, the municipality may not take any action to 40 
sell the property to a 3rd party until the value of the munici pal lien for nonpayment of 41 
taxes established by this chapter exceeds 50% of the municipal assessed value of the 42 
property.  43 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR2290(01) -1 
 B.  The owner may purchase the property at any time before the property is sold or 1 
may purchase it after the sale from the 3rd party i f allowed by municipal ordinance or 2 
other law for the amount of taxes owed plus interest, fees or other charges allowed by 3 
law.  If a municipality conveys the premises back to the former record titleholder or 4 
to a successor of that holder who obtained titl e before the foreclosure for a 5 
consideration of the taxes and costs due, the rights of the other parties claiming an 6 
interest of record in the premises at the time of foreclosure, including mortgagees, 7 
lien creditors or other secured parties, are revived a s if the tax lien mortgage had not 8 
been foreclosed.  9 
C.  The sale of the property by the municipality, other than to the owner whose 10 
property has been the subject of foreclosure pursuant to this section, must be 11 
conducted in a commercially reasonable manner . The property must be listed for sale 12 
and sold by an independent licensed broker.  The property may not be sold for less 13 
than its municipal assessed value absent an appraisal conducted by a licensed 14 
appraiser that demonstrates that the fair market value o f the property has deteriorated 15 
since the most recent tax assessment by the municipality, after which the property 16 
may be sold for the newly appraised value.  17 
D.  The municipality or any purchaser of the property from the municipality may not 18 
take any actio n to remove the former owner from the property until after a sale 19 
contemplated by this section is completed and any right that the former owner may 20 
have to repurchase the property by municipal ordinance or other law has expired.  21 
E.  Any proceeds received f rom the sale of the property in excess of the tax owed, 22 
interest and allowable fees, including any real estate broker fee or fees paid for 23 
mediation services, must be refunded to the former owner.  24 
5.  Discharge of lien.  A discharge of a municipal tax lie n mortgage given after the 25 
right of redemption has expired, if the discharge has been recorded in the registry of 26 
deeds for more than one year, terminates all title of the municipality derived from that tax 27 
lien mortgage or any other recorded tax lien mort gage for which the right of redemption 28 
expired 10 years or more prior to the foreclosure date of this discharged lien, unless the 29 
municipality has conveyed any interest based upon the title acquired from any of the 30 
affected liens. This subsection applies t o discharges of municipal tax lien mortgages 31 
given after October 1, 1935.  32 
SUMMARY  33 
This bill creates a preforeclosure process that municipalities must follow in order to 34 
successfully foreclose a tax lien on property of a homeowner 65 years of age or older.  35 
The preforeclosure process includes active municipal assistance with an abatement 36 
application and mediation if necessary to create a reasonable tax payment plan. This bill 37 
also creates additional provisions concerning the sale of foreclosed property for a ll 38 
homeowners including allowing a homeowner to pay the tax lien with interest and costs 39 
before a tax sale; allowing a homeowner to remain in the home until the sale is 40 
completed; requiring the use of a real estate broker when the property is sold; and 41 
requiring the return to the homeowner of any net proceeds from the sale after adjustment 42 
for taxes owed, interest, fees and other allowable costs.  43
