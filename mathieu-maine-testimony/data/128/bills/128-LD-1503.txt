 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, it is likely that applicants will seek financing for projects using the 3 
Revenue Obligation  Securities Program before this Act takes effect if it is not enacted on 4 
an emergency basis; and  5 
Whereas, if this Act is not enacted on an emergency basis, applicants could obtain 6 
financing without sufficient credit safeguards to protect against the callin g upon the moral 7 
obligation of the State, leading to undue losses to the State; and  8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 10 
immedi ately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 11 
therefore,  12 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  13 
Sec. 1.  10 MRSA §1043, sub -§2, ¶O, as amended by PL 2015, c. 504, §3, is 14 
further amended to read:  15 
O.  In the case of an energy distribution system project or an energy generating 16 
system project regulated by the Public Utilities Commission with respect to rates or 17 
terms of service or that requires, for construction or operation, authorization or 18 
certifica tion from the commission, the following conditions are met.  19 
(1)  The energy distribution system project or the energy generating system 20 
project has received all authorizations or certifications from the Public Utilities 21 
Commission necessary for constructio n and operation of the project.  The 22 
authority may issue a certificate of approval for a project that has received 23 
conditional approvals or certifications from the commission, except that the 24 
authority's certificate becomes legally effective only upon fulf illment of the 25 
conditional provisions of the commission's certificates or approvals.  If the 26 
commission has approved rates to be charged by the project or has issued a 27 
certificate of public convenience and necessity for the project, the authority shall 28 
take into consideration any findings and conclusions of law of the commission, 29 
including any findings and conclusions pertaining to the need for the project and 30 
the financial viability of the project.  31 
(2)  The authority has reviewed and considered any comment s provided by the 32 
Director of the Governor's Energy Office and the Public Advocate.  33 
(3)  The authority has determined that the applicant is creditworthy and that there 34 
is a reasonable  strong  likelihood that the revenue obligation securities will be 35 
repaid through the revenues of the project and any other sources of revenues and 36 
collateral pledged to the repayment of those securities.  In order to make these 37 
determinations, the authority shall consider such factors as it considers necessary 38 
and appropriate i n light of the special purpose or other nature of the business 39 
entity owning the project and the specific purposes of the project to measure and 40 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0783(01) -1 
 evaluate the project and the sufficiency of the pledged revenues to repay the 1 
obligations, including, but not l imited to:  2 
(a)  Whether the individuals or entities obligated to repay the obligations 3 
have demonstrated sufficient revenues from the project or from other sources 4 
to repay the obligations and a reasonable probability that those revenues will 5 
continue to b e available for the term of the revenue obligation securities;  6 
(b)  Whether the applicant demonstrates a reasonable probability that the 7 
project will continue to operate and provide the public benefits projected to 8 
be created for the term of the revenue ob ligation securities;  9 
(c)  Whether the applicant's creditworthiness is demonstrated by factors such 10 
as its historical financial performance, management ability, plan for 11 
marketing its product or service and ability to access conventional financing;  12 
(d)  Whe ther the applicant meets or exceeds industry average financial 13 
performance ratios commonly accepted in determining creditworthiness in 14 
that industry;  15 
(e)  Whether the applicant demonstrates that the need for authority assistance 16 
is due to the reduced cost and increased flexibility of the financing for the 17 
project that result from authority assistance and not from an inability to 18 
obtain necessary financing without the capital reserve fund security provided 19 
by the authority;  20 
(f)  Whether collateral securing t he repayment obligation is reasonably 21 
sufficient under the circumstances;  22 
(g)  Whether the proposed project enhances the opportunities for economic 23 
development;  24 
(h)  The effect that the proposed project financing has on the authority's 25 
financial resources;  26 
(i)  The financial performance of similar projects;  27 
(j)  The need for the project, as determined by the Public Utilities 28 
Commission and as indicated by any comments provided by the Director of 29 
the Governor's Energy Office, other public officials and membe rs of the 30 
public;  31 
(k)  The nature and extent of customer commitment to use the project or the 32 
fuel or energy the project distributes, transmits or generates;  33 
(l)  The cost advantages to end users of the fuel or energy to be distributed, 34 
transmitted or gene rated by the project, to the extent those advantages may 35 
affect market penetration by the project; and  36 
(m)  The nature and extent of the applicant's equity contribution to payment 37 
of the costs of the project; such a contribution may not be less than 25% of  38 
the expected cost of the project.  39 
This paragraph is repealed January 1, 2020.  40

 Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 1 
legislation takes effect when approved.  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill amends a provision in the Finance Authority of Maine Act related to bond 4 
financing for energy projects to require as part of the Finance Authority of Maine's 5 
approval criteria that a borrower demonstrate a strong likelihood instead of a reasonable 6 
likelihood of the borrower's ability to repay the bonds  through project revenues or other 7 
revenues and collateral, to match other authority moral obligation bond program 8 
requirements.  9
