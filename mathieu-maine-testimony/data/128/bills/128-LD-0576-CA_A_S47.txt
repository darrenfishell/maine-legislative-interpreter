128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A,, to S.P. 191, L.D. 576, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Laws Governing Funding for Landfill Closure Costs" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in paragraph E by striking out all of subparagraph (1) 
(page 1, lines 7 to 11 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'(1) The commissioner originally issued a license on or before September 1, 1989 
or accepted a license application for processing on or before September 1, 1989 
that was approved by the commissioner within one year of acceptance for 
processing for operation of the landfill and found that the landfill met the design 
requirements and environmental protection standards at the time of licensing; 
and' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, amends the bill by 
clarifying that the eligibility of a landfill for reimbursement of certain closure and 
remediation costs under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38, section 1310-F is 
dependent on whether the landfill was issued a license on or before September 1, 1989 or 
whether the landfill's license application was accepted for processing by the Department 
of Environmental Protection on or before September 1, 1989 and such license was 
approved within one year of the date the license application was accepted for processing.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to pay 75% of the costs incurred before 
December 31, 2025 of closing municipal landfills that meet certain criteria. This bill extends eligibility to municipal 
landfills with applications to the DEP that were accepted for processing on or before September 1, 1989 and that were 
approved within one year of the acceptance date. The DEP has indicated that there is one active landfill in Old Town 
that meets the new eligibility criteria and that it would cost $350,000 to reimburse Old Town 75% of closure costs. 
The DEP share will be paid from the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund (MSWMF) within the DEP, which 
derives its revenue from fees on the disposal of construction and demolition debris. Under existing statute, the fee will 
continue to be collected until all existing landfill closure costs subject to DEP reimbursement are paid. The addition 
of another landfill to reimburse will lower annual payments to reimburse other municipalities for landfill closure costs 
and extend the period of time they will be reimbursed to keep the annual aggregate distribution from the MSWMF 
unchanged. Therefore, the additional $350,000 will be paid in a future period when the existing payments would have 
ceased but will now continue. The DEP has expressed concern that municipalities may be affected by having their 
payments lowered.
