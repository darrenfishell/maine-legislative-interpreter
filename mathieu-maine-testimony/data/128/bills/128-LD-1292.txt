B.  Is the person to whom the debt arising from the  consumer credit transaction is 8 
initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such 9

plan involving a credit card, the card issuer and a ny person who honors the credit 11 
card and offers a discount that is a finance charge are creditors.  12 
For the purpose of the requirements imposed under Article 8 -A for credit billing pursuant 13 
to 15 United States Code, Section 1666 et seq. and for open -end con sumer credit pursuant 14

and (b)(10), "creditor" also includes card issuers whether or not the amount due is 16 
payable by agreement in more than 4 installments or the p ayment of a finance charge is or 17

those card issuers, to the extent appropriate, even though the requirements are by their 19 
terms applicable only to creditors offering open -end credit plans.  20 
For the purposes of this Title, "creditor" also includes any person who originates 2 or 21 
more mortgages referred to as high -cost mortgage loans under Article 8 -A, section 8 -506 22

 A.  For a lender subject to this subsection whose activities include making or 1 
arranging residential mortgage loans, an application for a license to make or service  2 
supervised lo ans must be made electronically, through the nationwide mortgage 3 
licensing system and registry.  Licenses expire December 31st of each year and must 4 
be renewed through the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry.  An 5 
application for an initial li cense must be accompanied by a fee of $250, and an annual 6 
renewal application must be accompanied by a fee of $100.  An application for an 7 
initial license or renewal for a place of business other than that of the applicant's first 8 
licensed location must be  accompanied by a fee of $100.  An applicant must also pay 9 
a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry processing fee in an amount to 10 
be determined by the administrators of the nationwide mortgage licensing system and 11 
registry.  A nonprofit organiz ation exempt from taxation under the United States 12 
Internal Revenue Code, Section 501(c)(3) and engaged in the financing of housing 13 
for low -income people under a program designed specifically for that purpose must 14 
pay an initial licensing fee, and a fee fo r each branch location, of $20 and a renewal 15 
licensing fee and renewal fee for each branch location of $10, plus the applicable 16 
nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry processing fee.  17 
B.  For a lender subject to this subsection whose activities d o not include making or 18 
arranging residential mortgage loans, an initial application for a license must be 19 
accompanied by a $500 fee and a renewal application must include a $200 fee.  A 20 
license is granted for a 2 -year period and expires on September 30th of the 2nd year.  21 
An application for an initial license or renewal for a place of business other than that 22 
of the applicant's first licensed location must be accompanied by a fee of $200.  23 
2.  A license to make or service  supervised loans or as a mortgage l oan originator 24 
may not be issued unless the administrator, upon investigation, finds that the financial 25 
responsibility, character and fitness of the applicant, and of the members thereof, if the 26 
applicant is a copartnership or association, and of the offic ers and directors thereof, if the 27 
applicant is a corporation, and, when applicable, the character and fitness of the mortgage 28 
loan originators thereof, are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated 29 
honestly and fairly within the purposes  of this Act.  In determining the financial 30 
responsibility of an applicant proposing to engage in making insurance premium loans, 31 
the administrator shall consider the liabilities the lender may incur for erroneous 32 
cancellation of insurance.  33 
A.  Every appli cant shall also, at the time of filing such application, file with the 34 
administrator, if the administrator so requires, a surety bond satisfactory to the 35 
administrator in an amount not to exceed $50,000.  The terms of the bond must run 36 
concurrent with the period of time during which the license will be in effect.  The 37 
bond must run to the State for the use of the State and of any person or persons who 38 
may have a cause of action against the licensee under this Act.  The bond must be 39 
conditional that the lice nsee will faithfully conform to and abide by the provisions of 40 
this Act and to all rules lawfully made by the administrator under this Act and will 41 
pay to the State and to any such person or persons any and all amounts of money that 42 
may become due or owing  to the State or to such person or persons from the licensee 43 
under and by virtue of this Act during the period for which the bond is given.  44 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR0767(01) -1 
 B.  As used in this section, the term "financial responsibility" means that the applicant 1 
has available for the oper ation of the licensed business net assets of at least $25,000 2 
and upon issuance of a license, each licensee shall maintain net assets of at least 3 
$25,000 that are either used or readily available for use in the conduct of the business 4 
of each office of the  licensee in which supervised loans are made or serviced . 5 
D.  In determining the financial responsibility of a nonprofit organization engaged in 6 
the financing of housing for low -income people under a program specifically 7 
designed for that purpose, the admi nistrator may waive the requirement of a bond and 8 
availability of $25,000 of net assets, if the applicant submits appropriate additional 9 
evidence of financial responsibility.  10 
3.  Upon written request, the applicant is entitled to a hearing on the question of the 11 
applicant's qualifications for a license or registration if (a) the administrator has notified 12 
the applicant in writing that the application has been denied, or (b) the administrator has 13 
not issued a license or registration within 60 days after the application for the license or 14 
registration was filed.  A request for a hearing may not be made more than 15 days after 15 
the administrator has mailed a writing to the applicant notifying the applicant that the 16 
application has been denied and stating in subs tance the administrator's findings 17 
supporting denial of the application.  18 
4.  A separate license is required for each place of business.  Each branch location 19 
license application must be accompanied by a surety bond, in a form acceptable to the 20 
administrato r, in the amount of $50,000.  21 
5.  A licensee may conduct the business of making or servicing  supervised loans only 22 
at or from any place of business for which he the licensee  holds a license and not under 23 
any other name than that in the license.  For purpose s of this subsection, the closing of a 24 
supervised loan, secured by an interest in real estate, made by the licensee, at the office of 25 
an attorney or land title company, shall  may not be considered the making or servicing  of 26 
a supervised loan at the place o f business other than the licensee's licensed location.  27 
Loans made pursuant to a lender credit card do not violate this subsection.  28 
5-A.  A licensee subject to subsection 1, paragraph A may conduct the business of 29 
making supervised loans only through a mo rtgage loan originator who possesses a 30 
current, valid license.  31 
6.  Any supervised loan, otherwise valid under the provisions of this Act, made by 32 
any corporation or by any subsidiary or affiliate of any corporation to which a license is 33 
granted by the admi nistrator on or before June 30, 1975, and to which said supervised 34 
loan is assigned, shall be  is deemed to have been made by a duly licensed licensee, 35 
provided the administrator finds that said corporation has made a good faith effort to 36 
comply with the li censing provisions of this Act.  37 
Sec. 7.  9-A MRSA §2 -303, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 427, Pt. B, §7, is 38 
further amended to read:  39 
1.  The administrator may file a complaint with the District Court to suspend or 40 
revoke a license to make or, originate or service  supervised loans if the administrator 41 
finds reason to believe, after investigation or hearing, or both, that:  42 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0767(01) -1 
 A.  The licensee has violated this Act or any rule or order made pursuant to this Act; 1 
or 2 
B.  Facts or conditions exist that would cle arly have justified the administrator in 3 
refusing to grant a license had these facts or conditions been known to exist at the 4 
time the application for the license was made.  5 
An affirmative finding by the District Court of either cause is sufficient to suspe nd or 6 
revoke the license.  7 
Sec. 8.  9-A MRSA §2 -303-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 427, Pt. B, §8, is further 8 
amended to read:  9 
§2-303-A.  Temporary suspension of license  10 
Notwithstanding Title 5, sections 10003 and 10004 and Title 10, section 8003, if the 11 
public interest or the protection of borrowers so requires, the administrator may, by order, 12 
suspend a license to make or service  supervised loans or a license as a mortgage loan 13 
originator or postpone the effective date of such a license.  Upon entry of the o rder, the 14 
administrator shall promptly notify the applicant or licensee that an order has been 15 
entered, of the reasons for the order and that, within 15 days after the receipt of a written 16 
request by the applicant or licensee, the matter must be scheduled for hearing.  Section 17 
2-303 applies to all subsequent proceedings.  18 
Sec. 9.  9-A MRSA §2 -304, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 466, §6, is further 19 
amended to read:  20 
2.  The administrator may direct each licensee to file composite annual and quarterly 21 
report s relating to all supervised loans made or, arranged or serviced  by that licensee. 22 
Information contained in annual and quarterly reports is confidential and may be 23 
published only in composite form. The administrator may at any time require additional 24 
repor ts if the administrator determines such action necessary to the proper supervision of 25 
licensees.  26 
Sec. 10.  9-A MRSA §2 -309, as enacted by PL 1973, c. 762, §1, is amended to 27 
read:  28 
§2-309.  No other business for purpose of evasion  29 
A supervised lender may not  carry on other business for the purpose of evasion or 30 
violation of this Act at a location where he the supervised lender  makes or services  31 
supervised loans.  32 
SUMMARY  33 
This bill amends the Maine Consumer Credit Code to add mortgage loan servicer to 34 
the defin ition of "creditor," to define "mortgage loan servicer" and to require mortgage 35 
loan servicers to be licensed in the same manner as supervised lenders are.  36
