7.  Testing procedure.   A testing laboratory shall perform a screening test on each 9 
sample submitted by the employer for only those substances of abuse that the employer 10 
requests to be identified.  If a screening test result  is negative, no further test may be 11 
conducted on that sample.  If a screening test result is positive, a confirmation test shall  12 
must  be performed on that sample.  A testing laboratory shall retain all confirmed 13 
positive samples for one year in a manner t hat will inhibit deterioration of the samples 14 
and allow subsequent retesting.  All other samples shall  must  be disposed of immediately 15 
after testing.  16 
8.  Laboratory report of test results.   This subsection governs the reporting of test 17 
results.  18 
A.  A labor atory report of test results shall  must , at a minimum, state:  19 
(1)  The name of the laboratory that performed the test or tests;  20 
(2)  Any confirmed positive results on any tested sample.  21 
(a)  Unless the employee or applicant consents, test results shall  may not be 22

test result was positive or negative.  This division does not apply if the test or 24 
the test results become the subject of any grievance procedure, administrative 25 
proceedi ng or civil action.  26 
(b)  A testing laboratory and the employer must  shall  ensure that an 27 
employee's unconfirmed positive screening test result cannot be determined 28 
by the employer in any manner, including, but not limited to, the method of 29 
billing the empl oyer for the tests performed by the laboratory and the time 30 
within which results are provided to the employer.  This division does not 31 
apply to test results for applicants;  32 
(3)  The sensitivity or cutoff level of the confirmation test; and  33 
(4)  Any availab le information concerning the margin of accuracy and precision 34

results.  6 
C.  The testing laboratory shall send test reports for samples segregated at an 7 
employee's or applicant's request under subsection 5, paragraph A, to both the 8 
employer  and the employee or applicant tested.  9 
D.  Every employer whose uniform  policy certification  is approved by the 10 
Department of Labor under section 686 shall annually send to the department a 11 
compilation of the results of all substance abuse  use tests admini stered by that 12 
employer in the previous calendar year.  This report shall  must  provide separate 13 
categories for employees and applicants and shall  must  be presented in statistical 14 
form so that no person who was tested by that employer can be identified from  the 15 
report.  The report shall  must  include a separate category for any tests conducted on a 16 
random or arbitrary basis under section 684, subsection 3.  17 
E.  Any laboratory -confirmed positive substance use test results must be reported to a 18 
medical review of ficer.  The medical review officer may be directly or indirectly 19 
retained by the employer, but shall act independently in carrying out any testing 20 
reviews or recommendations.  The medical review officer shall contact the employee 21 
and, if necessary, the emp loyee's physician to review each confirmed positive 22 
substance use test or any test found to be adulterated, substituted or otherwise invalid 23 
to determine whether there is, in the opinion of the medical review officer, a 24 
legitimate medical explanation for t he result.  An exchange between the employee 25

Sec. 10.  26 MRSA §684, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §2, is further amended 10 
to read:  11 
§684.  Imposition of tests  12 
1.  Testing of applicants.   An employer may require, request or suggest that an 13 
applicant submit to a substance abuse  use test only if:  14 
A.  The applica nt has been offered employment with the employer; or  15 
B.  The applicant has been offered a position on a roster of eligibility from which 16 
applicants will be selected for employment.  The number of persons on this roster of 17 
eligibility may not exceed the num ber of applicants hired by that employer in the 18 
preceding 6 months.  19 
The offer of employment or offer of a position on a roster of eligibility may be 20 
conditioned on the applicant receiving a negative test result.  21 
2.  Probable cause testing of employees.   An employer may require, request or 22 
suggest that an employee submit to a substance abuse test if the employer has probable 23 
cause to test the employee.  24 
A.  The employee's immediate supervisor, other supervisory personnel, a licensed 25 
physician or nurse, or the  employer's security personnel shall make the determination 26 
of probable cause.  27 
B.  The supervisor or other person must state, in writing, the facts upon which this 28 
determination is based and provide a copy of the statement to the employee.  29 
2-A.  Impairment  detection required; testing of employees.  An employer may 30 
require, request or suggest that an employee submit to a substance use test, an impairment 31 
determination by an occupational health care provider, or both, only if the employer has 32 
made an impairme nt detection regarding the employee pursuant to this subsection.  33 
A.  Only supervisory, human resources or security personnel approved for 34 
impairment detection by the Department of Labor or a licensed physician or nurse 35 
may make an impairment detection rega rding an individual employee.  36 
B.  The person making the impairment detection shall state in writing, on a form 37 
provided by the department, the facts upon which the detection is based, and shall 38 
provide a copy of the completed form to the employee as soon a s possible but no later 39 
 
 Page 14 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 than 24 hours from the time the detection is made.  The completed impairment 1 
detection form must be provided to the employee prior to any substance use testing of 2 
that employee.  3 
C.  At least 2 weeks prior to conducting any impairmen t detection activities under 4 
this subsection, the employer must provide the department with a list of all positions 5 
subject to impairment detection activities and notify employees by posting that list in 6 
a location accessible to all employees.  The employe r may amend the list as long as, 7 
at least 2 weeks prior to any impairment detection activities, employees whose 8 
positions are being added to the list are notified of their inclusion on the list, the 9 
amended list is posted in a location accessible to employ ees and the amended list is 10 
submitted to the department.  11 
D.  Subject to any limitation of the Maine Human Rights Act or any other state or 12 
federal law, there may be no cause of action against an employer for making and 13 
acting upon impairment detection in a ccordance with this subsection as long as the 14 
completed impairment detection form is provided to the employee and the 15 
impairment detection is based on the employer's good faith belief that the employee 16 
was impaired at work.  17 
E.  An impairment detection may not be based exclusively on:  18 
(1)  Information received from an anonymous informant; or  19 
(2)  Any information tending to indicate that an employee may have possessed or 20 
used a substance of abuse off duty, except when the employee is observed 21 
possessing or in gesting any substance of abuse while either on the employer's 22 
premises or in the proximity of the employer's premises during or immediately 23 
before the employee's working hours.  24 
2-B.  Impairment determination; temporary removal.  If an impairment detection 25 
is made, the employer may immediately remove the employee, or temporary employee, 26 
from the workplace pending resolution of the impairment detection.  27 
A.  Any impairment detection must be confirmed through a medical review by an 28 
occupational health care prov ider prior to any further action by the employer based 29 
on the impairment determination.  The occupational health care provider may require 30 
that the employee submit to testing for substances of abuse, including prescription 31 
medications, to assist in investi gating and confirming the impairment detection.  The 32 
occupational health care provider may perform a fitness -for-duty evaluation of the 33 
employee.  The occupational health care provider may direct the employee to obtain 34 
further medical evaluation either by the employee's physician or by another licensed 35 
physician acceptable to the occupational health care provider.  36 
B.  Any substance use testing subsequent to an impairment detection confirmation 37 
must be done by an independent testing facility, and all screeni ng and confirmatory 38 
test results must be delivered to the medical review officer for review according to 39 
section 683, subsection 8, paragraph E.  The medical review officer shall provide the 40 
results to the occupational health care provider and may not prov ide the results to the 41 
employer.  When an employer is using a substance use test only, the medical review 42 
officer shall provide the results to the employer.  Prescription medications may be 43 
 
 Page 15 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 tested for only when impairment detection has been made, and only for the purpose 1 
of assisting the occupational health care provider in evaluating whether an employee 2 
is impaired and the cause of the impairment.  3 
C.  The occupational health care provider shall make the final determination of 4 
whether an employee was or is impaired, identify the cause of any impairment, 5 
determine whether the employee can continue to perform any safety -sensitive tasks 6 
and determine the impairment remediation program, if any, necessary to ensure that 7 
the impairment will not recur or will not a dversely affect the safety of the employee, 8 
coworkers and other persons at the work site in the future.  The occupational health 9 
care provider may also make further recommendations regarding the employee's 10 
ability to safely perform all assigned tasks, incl uding requiring any remedial 11 
measures, which may include, without limitation, compliance with return -to-work 12 
agreements or a written agreement by the employee to schedule any necessary 13 
medications in a manner that will not lead to impairment on the job.  A  return -to- 14 
work agreement may be used if an employee has violated the drug -free workplace 15 
policy and has been provided the opportunity to participate in treatment as a 16 
condition of continued employment or reemployment.  17 
D.  If the occupational health care p rovider finds that the employee was not impaired 18 
on the job or that any such impairment did not pose a safety risk and did not violate 19 
the employer's established drug -free workplace policy, the employer shall reinstate 20 
the employee to the employee's positi on. 21 
E.  If an impairment detection is made at a time when an occupational health care 22 
provider is not normally available for work, the employer may take any steps to 23 
remove the employee, and, prior to the employee's next scheduled work day, the 24 
employer ma y determine whether to allow the employee to return to work or to 25 
request an impairment determination or fitness -for-duty evaluation by the 26 
occupational health care provider.  27 
F.  An occupational health care provider who makes or acts upon an impairment 28 
determination in accordance with this section is not subject to a cause of action as 29 
long as the determination is based on the occupational health care provider's good 30 
faith, professional judgment.  An occupational health care provider may not be an 31 
employee or agent of, or have any financial interest in, a testing laboratory for which 32 
the occupational health care provider is reviewing drug test results.  An occupational 33 
health care provider may not derive any financial benefit by having an employer use 34 
a labo ratory that may be construed as a potential conflict of interest.  35 
3.  Random or arbitrary testing of employees.  In addition to testing employees on 36 
a probable cause basis under subsection 2, an  An employer may require , request or 37 
suggest  that an employee submit to a substance abuse  use test on a random or arbitrary 38 
basis if:  39 
A.  The employer and the employee have bargained for provisions in a collective 40 
bargaining agreement, either before or after the effective date of this subchapter, that 41 
provide for ran dom or arbitrary testing of employees.  A random or arbitrary testing 42 
program that would result from implementation of an employer's last best offer is not 43 
 
 Page 16 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 considered a provision bargained for in a collective bargaining agreement for 1 
purposes of this secti on; 2 
B.  The employee works in a position the nature of which would create an 3 
unreasonable  could pose a  threat to the health or safety of the public or the 4 
employee's coworkers if the employee were under the influence of  impaired by  a 5 
substance of abuse.  I t is the intent of the Legislature that the requirements of this 6 
paragraph be narrowly construed; or  7 
C.  The employer has established a random or arbitrary testing program under this 8 
paragraph that applies to all employees, except as provided in subparagra ph (4), 9 
regardless of position.  10 
(1)  An employer may establish a testing program under this paragraph only if the 11 
employer has 50 10 or more employees who are not covered by a collective 12 
bargaining agreement.  13 
(2)  The written policy required by section 683 , subsection 2 with respect to a 14 
testing program under this paragraph must be developed by a committee of at 15 
least 10 of the employer's employees.  The employer shall appoint members to 16 
the committee from a cross -section of employees who are eligible to be  tested.  17 
The committee must include a medical professional who is trained in procedures 18 
for testing for substances of abuse.  If no such person is employed by the 19 
employer, the employer shall obtain the services of such a person to serve as a 20 
member of th e committee created under this subparagraph.  21 
(2-A) An employer may establish a random or arbitrary testing program under 22 
this paragraph if the employer is required to test employees to retain a contract.  23 
An employee may be allowed to sign a waiver exempti ng the employee from 24 
testing when required for a contract and the employee acknowledges that the 25 
employee may not have an opportunity to work under the contract for which 26 
testing is required.  27 
(3)  The written policy developed under subparagraph (2) must al so require that 28 
selection of employees for testing be performed by a person or entity not subject 29 
to the employer's influence, such as a medical review officer.  Selection must be 30 
made from a list, provided by the employer, of all employees subject to test ing 31 
under this paragraph. The list may not contain information that would identify the 32 
employee to the person or entity making the selection.  33 
(4)  Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement are not 34 
included in testing programs pursuant to this paragraph unless they agree to be 35 
included pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement as described under 36 
paragraph A.  37 
(5)  Before initiating a testing program under this paragraph, the employer must 38 
obtain from the Department of Labor approval o f the policy developed by the 39 
employee committee, as required in section 686.  If the employer does not 40 
approve of the written policy developed by the employee committee, the 41 
employer may decide not to submit the policy to the department and not to 42 
establi sh the testing program.  The employer may not change the written policy 43 
without approval of the employee committee.  44 
 
 Page 17 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 (6)  The employer may not discharge, suspend, demote, discipline or otherwise 1 
discriminate with regard to compensation or working conditions  against an 2 
employee for participating or refusing to participate in an employee committee 3 
created pursuant to this paragraph.  4 
(7) An arbitrary test may be conducted only on an employee whose job is of a 5 
nature that could pose a threat to the health or saf ety of the public or coworkers if 6 
the employee were under the influence of a substance of abuse.  7 
4.  Testing while undergoing treatment.   While the employee is participating in a 8 
substance abuse rehabilitation  treatment  program either as a result of volunt ary contact 9 
with or mandatory referral to the employer's employee assistance program or after a 10 
confirmed positive test result as provided in section 685, subsection 2, paragraphs B and 11 
C, substance abuse  use testing may be conducted by the rehabilitation or treatment 12 
provider as required, requested or suggested by that provider.  13 
A.  Substance abuse  use testing conducted as part of such a rehabilitation or  treatment 14 
program is not subject to the provisions of this subchapter regulating substance abuse  15 
use testing.  16 
B.  An employer may not require, request or suggest that any substance abuse  use test 17 
be administered to any an employee while the employee is undergoing such 18 
rehabilitation or  treatment, except as provided in subsections 2 2-A and 3.  19 
C.  The resul ts of any substance abuse  use test administered to an employee as part of 20 
such a rehabilitation or  treatment program may not be released to the employer.  21 
5.  Testing upon return to work.   If an employee who has received a confirmed 22 
positive test result ret urns to work with the same employer, whether or not the employee 23 
has participated in a rehabilitation  treatment  program under section 685, subsection 2, the 24 
employer may require , request or suggest  that the employee submit to a subsequent 25 
substance abuse  use test anytime between 90 days and one year after the date of the 26 
employee's prior test.  A test may be administered under this subsection in addition to any 27 
tests conducted under subsections 2 2-A and 3.  An employer may require, request or 28 
suggest that an employee submit to a substance abuse  use test during the first 90 days 29 
after the date of the employee's prior test only as provided in subsections 2 2-A and 3.  30 
Sec. 11.  26 MRSA §685, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §3, is further amended 31 
to read:  32 
§685.  Action taken on substance use tests  33 
Action taken by an employer on the basis of a substance abuse  use test is limited as 34 
provided in this section.  35 
1.  Before receipt of test results.   An employer may suspend an employee with full 36 
pay and benefits or may t ransfer the employee to another position with no reduction in 37 
pay or benefits while awaiting an employee's test results.  38 
 
 Page 18 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 2.  Use of confirmation test results.   This subsection governs an employer's use of 1 
confirmed positive test results and an employee's o r applicant's refusal to submit to a test 2 
requested or required by an employer in compliance with this subchapter.  3 
A.  Subject to any limitation of the Maine Human Rights Act or any other state law or 4 
federal law , and to provisions in this subsection,  an employer may use a confirmed 5 
positive test result or for a substance of abuse,  refusal to submit to a substance use  6 
test, a violation of an established drug -free workplace policy or an impairment 7 
confirmed by an occupational health care provider pursuant to  section 684, 8 
subsection 2 -B as a factor in any of the following decisions:  9 
(1)  Refusal to hire an applicant for employment or refusal to place an applicant 10 
on a roster of eligibility;  11 
(2)  Discharge of an employee;  12 
(3)  Discipline of an employee; or  13 
(4)  Change in the employee's work assignment.  14 
A-1.  An employer who tests a person as an applicant and employs that person prior 15 
to receiving the test result may take no action on a confirmed  positive test result 16 
except in accordance with the employee provisi ons of the employer's approved  17 
uniform impairment and substance use testing  policy adopted pursuant to section 683, 18 
subsection 2 . 19 
B.  Before taking any action described in paragraph A in the case of an employee 20 
who receives an initial confirmed positive test result, an employer shall provide the 21 
employee with an opportunity to participate for up to 6 months  12 weeks  in a 22 
rehabilitation  treatment  program designed to enable the employee to avoid future use 23 
of a substance of abuse and to participate in an empl oyee assistance program, if the 24 
employer has such a program.  A confirmed impairment under section 684, 25 
subsection 2 -B caused by a substance of abuse is the same as an initial confirmed 26 
positive test result for purposes of this paragraph, with or without a  substance use test 27 
result.  A treatment program under this paragraph may be provided by an 28 
occupational health care provider.  Participation by an employee in a treatment 29 
program must begin within 30 days of the employee's receiving notice of the positive  30 
test result or confirmed impairment, unless otherwise agreed to by the employer.   The 31 
employer may take any action described in paragraph A if the employee receives a 32 
subsequent confirmed positive test result from a substance use  test administered by 33 
the employer under this subchapter or the employee receives a subsequent confirmed 34 
impairment caused by a substance of abuse with or without a substance use test . 35 
C.  If the employee chooses not to participate in a rehabilitation  treatment  program 36 
under this s ubsection, the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.  If 37 
the employee chooses to participate in a rehabilitation  treatment  program, the 38 
following provisions apply.  39 
(1)  If the employer has an employee assistance program that offers counsel ing or 40 
rehabilitation  treatment  services, the employee may choose to enter that program 41 
at the employer's expense.  If these services are not available from an employer's 42 
employee assistance program or if the employee chooses not to participate in that 43

 program, the employee may enter a public or private rehabilitation  treatment  1 
program.  2 
(a)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 3 
plan, the costs of the public or private rehabilitation  treatment  program , if 4 
required by the em ployer,  must be equally divided between the employer and 5 
employee if the employer has more than 20 50 full-time employees.  This 6 
requirement does not apply to municipalities or other political subdivisions of 7 
the State or to any employer when the employee is tested because of the 8 
alcohol and controlled substance testing mandated by the federal Omnibus 9 
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102 -143, Title V.  10 
If necessary, the  The employer shall  may assist in financing the cost share of 11 
the employee through a payroll deduction plan.  12 
(b)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 13 
plan, an employer with 20 50 or fewer full -time employees, a municipality or 14 
other political subdivision of the State is not required to  pay for any costs of 15 
rehabilitation or  treatment under any public or private rehabilitation  treatment  16 
program.  An employer is not required to pay for the costs of rehabilitation  17 
treatment  if the employee was tested because of the alcohol and controlled 18 
substance testing mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation Employee 19 
Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102 -143, Title V.  20 
(2)  No An employer may not take any action described in paragraph A while an 21 
employee is participating in a rehabilitation  treatment  program, except as 22 
provided in subparagraph (2 -A) and except that an employer may change the 23 
employee's work assignment or suspend the employee from active duty to reduce 24 
any possible safety hazard.  Except as provided in subparagraph (2 -A), an 25 
employee's  pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee is participating 26 
in a rehabilitation  treatment  program, provided  except  that the employer is not 27 
required to pay the employee for periods in which the employee is unavailable 28 
for work for the purposes o f rehabilitation  treatment  or while the employee is 29 
medically disqualified.  The employee may apply normal sick leave and vacation 30 
time, if any, for these periods.  31 
(2-A)  A rehabilitation or  treatment provider shall promptly notify the employer 32 
if the empl oyee fails to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation  treatment  33 
program before the expiration of the 6-month  12-week  period provided in 34 
paragraph B.  Upon receipt of this notice, the employer may take any action 35 
described in paragraph A.  36 
(3)  Except as p rovided in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 37 
rehabilitation  treatment  program, as determined by the rehabilitation or  treatment 38 
provider after consultation with the employer, the employee is entitled to return 39 
to the employee's previo us job with full pay and benefits unless conditions 40 
unrelated to the employee's previous confirmed positive test result make the 41 
employee's return impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must  may not 42 
conflict with any provision of a collective bargainin g agreement between the 43 
employer and a labor organization that is the collective bargaining representative 44 
of the unit of which the employee is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or  45 
 
 Page 20 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 treatment provider determines that the employee has not successful ly completed 1 
the rehabilitation  treatment  program within 6 months after starting the program, 2 
the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.  3 
(a)  If the employee who has completed rehabilitation  treatment  previously 4 
worked in an employment posi tion subject to random or arbitrary testing 5 
under an employer's written policy, the employer may refuse to allow the 6 
employee to return to the previous job if the employer believes that the 7 
employee may pose an unreasonable safety hazard because of the nat ure of 8 
the position.  The employer shall attempt to find suitable work for the 9 
employee immediately after refusing the employee's return to the previous 10 
position.  No reduction may be made in the employee's previous benefits or 11 
rate of pay while awaiting r eassignment to work or while working in a 12 
position other than the previous job.  The employee shall  must  be reinstated 13 
to the previous position or to another position with an equivalent rate of pay 14 
and benefits and with no loss of seniority within 6 months  after returning to 15 
work in any capacity with the employer unless the employee has received a 16 
subsequent confirmed positive test result within that time from a test 17 
administered under this subchapter or unless conditions unrelated to the 18 
employee's previou s confirmed positive test result make that reinstatement or 19 
reassignment impossible.  Placement of the employee in suitable work and 20 
reinstatement may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining 21 
agreement between the employer and a labor org anization that is the 22 
collective bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or 23 
would be a part.  24 
(b)  Notwithstanding division (a), if an employee who has successfully 25 
completed rehabilitation  treatment  is medically disqualified, the emp loyer is 26 
not required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 27 
during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not required to 28 
compensate the employee during the period of disqualification.  Immediately 29 
after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 30 
obligations under division (a) attach as if the employee had successfully 31 
completed rehabilitation  treatment  on that date.  32 
D.  This subsection does not require an employer to take any disciplinary action 33 
against an employee who refuses to submit to a test, receives a single or repeated 34 
confirmed positive test result or does not choose to participate in a rehabilitation  35 
treatment  program.  This subsection is intended to set minimum opportunities for an 36 
employee  with a substance abuse problem to address the problem through 37 
rehabilitation  treatment .  An employer may offer additional opportunities, not 38 
otherwise in violation of this subchapter, for rehabilitation  treatment  or continued 39 
employment without rehabilita tion treatment . 40 
3.  Confidentiality.   This subsection governs the use of information acquired by an 41 
employer in the testing process.  42 
A.  Unless the employee or applicant consents, all information acquired by an 43 
employer in the testing process is confidenti al and may not be released to any person 44 
other than the employee or applicant who is tested, any necessary personnel of the 45

law, including release under section 683, subsection 8, paragraph D; or  4 
(2)  The use of this information in any grievance procedure, administrative 5 
hearing or civil action re lating to the imposition of the test or the use of test 6 
results.  7 
B.  Notwithstanding any other law, the results of any substance abuse  use test 8 
required, requested or suggested by any employer may not be used in any criminal 9 
proceeding.  10

SUMMARY  22 
This bill makes changes to the laws governing employment practices concerning 23 
substance abuse testing, including the following.  24 
1. It replaces the phrase "substance abuse test" and "substance abu se testing" with 25 
"substance use test" and "substance use testing" to reflect current usage.  26 
2. It repeals a section of law that addresses nuclear power plants since there are no 27 
operating nuclear power plants in this State.  28 
3. It authorizes an employer tha t has employees subject to a federally mandated 29 
substance use testing program to extend federal drug testing activities to its entire 30 
workforce in order to maintain a single testing program and specifies that the employer 31 
must prepare a substance use testi ng plan for employees who are not federally regulated, 32 
provide a copy of the plan to the employees and the Department of Labor before testing, 33 
follow federal notification and procedural protocols for such employees and annually 34 
report the results of testin g to the department.  35 
4. It streamlines the current substance use testing policy approval by requiring the 36 
Department of Labor to develop a uniform impairment and substance use testing policy 37 
 
 Page 24 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 applicable to all employers.  Employers must certify their adopti on of the policy and be 1 
approved by the Department of Labor prior to conducting substance use testing.  2 
5. It removes the "probable cause" standard and replaces it with an "impairment 3 
detection" standard required before the employer may conduct substance u se testing.  For 4 
employers authorized to conduct substance use testing, only an employer or employee 5 
approved for impairment detection by the Department of Labor or a medical person may 6 
make an impairment detection.  Among other things, this detection may be based on a 7 
single work -related accident, unlike the "probable cause" standard under current law. The 8 
employer may immediately remove the employee from the workplace pending resolution 9 
of the impairment detection.  10 
6.  It adds an "impairment determinatio n" process that may be used as an alternative 11 
or in addition to a substance use test.  Under this process, an occupational health care 12 
provider conducts a medical review in order to confirm the impairment detection, which 13 
may include a substance use test t hat includes testing for prescription drugs.  If the 14 
impairment is confirmed, the employer may take employment action including firing or 15 
disciplining the employee, subject to any limitations under the Maine Human Rights Act 16 
and any other state or federal law.  If the occupational health care provider finds that the 17 
employee was not impaired or that such impairment did not pose a safety risk, the 18 
employee is entitled to full reinstatement to the employee's position.  19 
7.  It adds a violation of an established  drug-free workplace policy as grounds for 20 
employment action.  21 
8.  It adds a first impairment determination to the requirement, applicable to an initial 22 
confirmed positive substance use test, that the employer must provide the employee with 23 
an opportunity t o participate in a treatment program before discharging or disciplining the 24 
employee.  The time frame for completing the treatment program is reduced from 6 25 
months to 12 weeks, and an employer with between 20 and 50 full -time employees is no 26 
longer require d to pay half of the costs of the treatment program.  An employer with more 27 
than 50 full -time employees must pay half of treatment costs not covered by a group 28 
health insurance plan when the treatment program is required of the employee.  29 
9. It modifies the  current requirement that, prior to establishing a substance use 30 
testing program, an employer with over 20 full -time employees have a functioning 31 
employee assistance program, instead requiring the program of employers with over 50 32 
full-time employees.  33 
10. It expands the number of establishments that may undertake company -wide 34 
random substance use testing by authorizing such testing for companies with 10 or more 35 
employees instead of with 50 employees, as is the current standard.  36 
11.  It provides that a confi rmed positive substance use test may be reported to the 37 
employee only by a medical review officer and allows an employee to provide a 38 
legitimate medical explanation for a positive test result for legally obtained medications, 39 
preventing the medical review officer from reporting a positive test for that substance to 40 
the employer.  41 
 
 Page 25 - 128LR0461(01) -1 
 12. It allows testing laboratories to use federal testing standards to encourage testing 1 
of biological samples beyond urine and blood.  2 
13. It adds a new civil violation for any empl oyer noncompliance with the substance 3 
use testing laws, for which a fine of not more than $500 for the first violation, $750 for 4 
the 2nd violation and $1,000 for 3rd and subsequent violations may be adjudged.  5
