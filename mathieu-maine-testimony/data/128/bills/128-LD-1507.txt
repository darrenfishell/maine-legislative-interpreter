applicable, not later than 10 bu siness days after the occurrence of the event that results in 28 
the change.  29 
8.  Incomplete application.  The superintendent may consider an application for a 30 
license under this Article abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for 31 
informatio n required under this Article or any rules adopted pursuant to this Article, as 32 
long as the superintendent notifies the applicant, in writing, that the application will be 33 
considered abandoned if the applicant fails to submit the information within 60 days  after 34 
the date on which the request for information was made. An application filing fee paid 35 
prior to the date an application is abandoned pursuant to this subsection may not be 36 
refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection does not preclude 37 
the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under this Article.  38 
9.  Change of license notification.  A licensee under this Article may not act within 39 
this State as a student loan servicer under any name or at any place of busines s other than 40 
those named in the license. Any change of location of a place of business of a licensee 41 
requires prior written notice to the superintendent. Not more than one place of business 42 
may be maintained under the same license, but the superintendent m ay issue more than 43 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR1018(01) -1

lawfully adopted or made pursuant to and within the authority of this Article; or  18 
B.  Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time of the original 19
