A.  The net generating capacity of a manufacturing jobs energy project may not 27 
exceed 10 megawatts.  28 
B.  The total net gener ating capacity of all manufacturing jobs energy projects 29 
combined may not exceed 30 megawatts.  30 
3.  Program eligibility criteria.  To be eligible to participate in the program, a 31

standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy 21 
matters on the program.  The report must include, but is not limited to:  22 
A.  Documentation of the progress of manufacturing jobs energy dev elopment, 23

generating capacity of those projects and the kilowatt -hours of electricity purchased 25 
from manufacturing jobs energy projects; and  26 
B.  Actions taken by the commission to  implement the program, an assessment of the 27 
effectiveness of the program with respect to encouraging the sustainable development 28 
of manufacturing jobs energy in the State and recommendations, including any 29 
necessary implementing legislation, to improve th e program.  30 
6.  Job growth accountability.  If manufacturing jobs are eliminated as a result of 31 
final closure of operations at the primary location in the State of a program participant, 32 
the commission may rescind that program participant’s long -term contra ct pursuant to 33 
section 3604, subsection 5 -A or cease the benefit of the renewable energy credit 34 
multiplier pursuant to section 3605.  35

SUMMARY  17 
This bill establishes the manufacturing jobs energy program to encourage growth of 18
