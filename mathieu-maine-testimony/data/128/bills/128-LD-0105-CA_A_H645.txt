This bill establishes the Substance Use Disorders Cabinet. State participation in cabinet activities includes the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Education, the 
Department of Labor, the Depa1iment of Public Safety and the Judicial Branch. It is expected that some duties

coordinating services and facilitating services will require additional fi.mding. The bill requires funds be pooled from 
each department represented in the cabinet and requires that duties be canied out within existing budgeted resources. 
The cabinet is authorized to solicit and receive funds from various sources. Because no funding was provided in the 
bill, the impact on other programs and services cannot be detennined.
