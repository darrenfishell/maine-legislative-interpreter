 SUMMARY  1 
This bill implements the recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory 2 
Committee relating to its review of existing public records exceptions enacted after 2004 3 
and before 2013.  4 
This bill repeals the current exception from the definition o f "public records" under 5 
Maine's Freedom of Access Act for social security numbers in the possession of the 6 
Secretary of State because this is duplicative of the existing general exception for social 7 
security numbers in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1,  section 402, subsection 3, 8 
paragraph N.  9 
This bill changes the criteria for designation of records of the Efficiency Maine Trust 10 
as confidential from requiring that each of 4 criteria be met to instead require that one of 11 
2 criteria be met. Those criteria are that a person to whom the record belongs has 12 
requested it be designated confidential and that the director of the Efficiency Maine Trust 13 
Board has determined the record contains proprietary information, access to which would 14 
result in some competitive disadvantage to any person to whom the record belongs or 15 
pertains or that the record contains information about the energy usage profile of an 16 
identifiable individual. The bill provides that the social security number, address, 17 
telephone number or e -mail a ddress of a customer who has participated or may 18 
participate in a program of the Efficiency Maine Trust is confidential. This bill also 19 
provides that the director of the Efficiency Maine Trust, instead of the Efficiency Maine 20 
Trust Board, may disclose or a uthorize disclosure of otherwise confidential information 21 
in certain specified circumstances.  22
