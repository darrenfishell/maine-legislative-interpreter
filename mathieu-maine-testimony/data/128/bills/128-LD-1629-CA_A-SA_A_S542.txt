This amendment removes the requirement for a separate notice to the taxpayer of potential eligibility to file for tax 
abatement. As the mandate for a separate notice is removed, the costs anticipated from increased abatement activity 
originating from the notification would not be considered mandated costs and the General Fund appropriation is 
reduced by $824,655 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The mandated requirements to engage a real estate broker, sell 
the property at fair market value or the price anticipated by the broker and remit excess proceeds to the taxpayer 
remain in the bill. As amended, the bill still contains an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $600 beginning in 
fiscal year 2018-19 to cover these costs. This amount represents 90% of the estimated net cost to municipalities not 
recovered through the sale of the property.
