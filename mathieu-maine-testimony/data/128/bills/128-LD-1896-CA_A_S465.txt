128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 726, L.D. 1896, Bill, "An Act To 
Improve Efficiency through Electric Rate Design and Advanced Technology" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Create an Electric Rate Design To Lower Maine's Energy Costs and 
Carbon Dioxide Emissions' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
1Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3152, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. F, §§2 
to 4, is further amended to read: 
1. Increased efficiency. The Legislature declares and finds that improvements in 
transmission and distribution utility rate design and related regulatory programs have 
great potential for reducing the cost of electric utility services to consumers, for 
encouraging energy conservation and efficient use of existing facilities and for 
minimizing the need for expensive new electric transmission capacity. It is the purpose 
of this chapter to: 
A. Require the commission to relate transmission and distribution rates more closely 
to the costs of providing transmission and distribution service, including 
consideration of fixed customer charges to the extent practicable and economically 
efficient; 
C. Require the commission to consider the ability of low-income residential 
customers to pay in full for electric services as transmission and distribution rates are 
redesigned consistent with these policies; and 
D. Require the commission to set rates, including transmission and distribution rates 
that vary by time of day and season and by other relevant cost drivers, to the extent 
practicable to achieve economic efficiency. 
Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3153-A, sub-§1, as corrected by RR 2009, c. 2, §103, is 
amended to read:

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
CO:MMITTEEAMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 726, L.D. 1896 
1 1. Proposals and programs developed. The commission, as it detetnlffies 
2 appropriate, shall may order investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to 
3 develop and submit specific rate design proposals and related programs for implementing 
4 energy conservation and energy efficiency techniques and innovations, either in 
5 oonjunetion ,.vith or independent of any rate making proceeding pending before the 
6 comm1ss1on. The proposals, as the commission determines, must be designed to 
7 encourage energy conservation, mlnlmize the need for nev,r transmlssion and distribution 
8 capacity, minim1:t1e costs of transmlssion and distribution service to consumers improve 
9 equity among customers, minimize transmission and distribution rates over the long term 
10 or short term and take into account the needs of low-income customers. In appr01Aag a 
11 proposal UR<ier this section, the commission shall give equivalent consideration to the 
12 goals of minimfaing costs and m.inimfaing transmission and distribution rates to 
13 consumers. Proposals must include, but are not limited to, proposals that provide for the 
14 development and implementation of: 
15 A. Load management techniques; 
16 B. Rates that reflect marginal costs of services at different voltages, times of day er .. 
17 seasons of the year or other relevant cost drivers, including short-run and long-run 
18 marginal costs associated with the construction of new transmission and distribution 
19 facilities; 
20 D. Rates or other regulatory policies that encourage maintain transmission and 
21 distribution utility system reliability; 
22 E. Transmission and distribution utility financing or subsidization of capital 
23 improvements undertaken by ratepayers to conserv:e optimize electricity used usage 
24 by the ratepayers in the future. This paragraph applies to future programs for utility 
25 financing of energy conservation or load management as long as the goal of such 
26 programs is to economically defer or eliminate the need for transmission and 
27 distribution plant upgrades. In addition to programs undertaken pursuant to this 
28 paragraph, programs may be undertaken pursuant to section 10110 to achieve goals 
29 other than that identified in this paragraph; 
30 F. As defined by the commission by rule, cost effective conversions of electric space 
31 heat systems to systems relying on other fuels and other techniques for enabling 
32 homeowners and tenants to reolace on oea:k. winter oeriod electric usa~e with less 
33 eKpensp1e sources of heat; 
34 G. Rates or bill payment assistance programs for residential customers who have 
35 been certified eligible for state or federal fuel assistance that take into account the 
36 difficulty these customers have paying in full for electric service or that target 
37 assistance to these customers in the most efficient manner, taking into account the 
38 necessity of maintaining electric service; and 
39 H. Rates or programs that allow encourage incremental use or maintenance of 
40 existing use when those rates uses serve to minjmjze rate levels for all transmission 
41 and distribution customers. In approving any proposal for rates or programs that 
42 allow encourage incremental use or maintenance of existing use, the commission 
43 shall seek to ensure that rates for all customer classes will be lower than they would 
44 have been had the commission not approved the proposal.

29 returned to consumers, except that funds targeted for low-income residential transmission 
30 and distribution consumers pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph B, subparagraph (1) that

18 First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.' 
19 SUMMARY 
20 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee and replaces the bill, 
21 specifies that the purposes of the law regarding rate design are to require the Public 
22 Utilities Commission to consider fixed customer charges, to the extent practicable and 
23 economically efficient, and to set transmission and distribution rates that vary by time of 
24 day and season or other relevant cost drivers, to the extent practicable, to achieve 
25 economic efficiency. Like the bill, the amendment does the following: 
26 1. It requires investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to submit specific 
27 rate design proposals to the commission by January 1, 2019; 
28 2. It removes the requirement that transmission and distribution utilities' proposals 
29 include cost-effective conversions of electric space heat systems; 
30 3. It removes the requirement that rate design changes implemented pursuant to the 
31 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3153-A be implemented on a temporary, · 
32 pilot or experimental basis and requires the commission to implement policies and 
33 practices to encourage competitive electricity providers to offer residential and 
34 commercial customers supply prices reflective of real-time market price variations; 
35 and 
36 4. It provides that Efficiency Maine Trust :funds targeted to low-income residential 
37 transmission and distribution consumers that are uncommitted 2 years after having 
38 been collected must be returned to those consumers. 
39 The amendment also directs the Office of the Public Advocate to convene a 
40 stakeholder group to evaluate options and prepare recommendations for certain issues 
41 related to the efficient and effective implementation of smart grid policy, including 
4 2 addressing costs and financial incentives of transmission and distribution utilities and the

2 Commission, Efficiency Maine Trust and transmission and distribution utilities with 
3 regard to nonwires alternatives and other smart grid functions. It also prohibits the Public 
4 Utilities Commission from implementing any final decisions related to rate proposals 
5 received pursuant to the commission's order of December 15, 2017 in the Public Utilities 
6 Commission's Docket No. 2016-00049 from any transmission and distribution utility until 
7 90 days after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature. 
8 Lastly, it requires the Public Utilities Commission to convene a stakeholder group to 
9 discuss allowing the Efficiency Maine Trust to use funds for electricity conservation 
10 programs for low-income residential consumers to promote the placement of high-
11 efficiency ductless heat pumps into qualified low-income homes by allowing the trust in

Provisions that require the Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT) to return any unused assessments collected from electricity

were not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years of the date the assessment was collected would reduce 
funding available for the EMT to conduct conservation programs. Any additional costs to the Public Utilities
