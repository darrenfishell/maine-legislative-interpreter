ORDERS
 
            (4-1)  On motion of Representative RECKITT of South Portland, the following
 Joint Resolution:  (H.P. 1369)
 
JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE
 STATE OF THE SCOTCH-IRISH MIGRANTS OF 1718 ON THE OCCASION
 OF THE 300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR ARRIVAL
 
            WHEREAS, October 2018 marks the 300th anniversary of the arrival in Casco
 Bay of 2 ships, the HMS McCallum and the HMS Robert, carrying a large group of
 immigrants from the north of Ireland; and 
            WHEREAS, the HMS Robert anchored in the Fore River off the coast of what is
 now South Portland and the HMS McCallum discharged settlers in the area of
 Merrymeeting Bay; and
             WHEREAS, Maine has many descendants of these settlers and later immigrants
 from the north of Ireland, who brought with them a unique worldview, language and
 musical culture that enriched and influenced Maine's development; and
 
            WHEREAS, the settlers brought with them fundamental beliefs in representative democracy and in freedom of religion, as they had been persecuted in Scotland and
 Ireland for their Presbyterian faith; and
 
            WHEREAS, they planted some of the first field crops of potatoes to be grown in
 New England, an agricultural product that has played a key role in the State's economic
 development; and
             WHEREAS, they brought with them a knowledge of textile production, having
 participated in the linen manufacturing trade in Ireland, and helped establish important
 textile manufacturing industries in Maine; and
 
            WHEREAS, these settlers and their descendants participated fully in Maine's
 local militias and the descendants have participated in all military activities in which the
 United States has been involved since 1776; and
             WHEREAS, these settlers and their descendants have produced many significant
 legislative and political figures who have played important roles in the history of the
 State and there have been at least 20 American Presidents with Scotch-Irish ancestry;
 now, therefore, be it
 
            RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth
 Legislature now assembled in the Second Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this opportunity to recognize in October 2018 the contributions of the
 Scotch-Irish in Maine and the Tricentennial of the Arrival of the 1718 Migrants.
