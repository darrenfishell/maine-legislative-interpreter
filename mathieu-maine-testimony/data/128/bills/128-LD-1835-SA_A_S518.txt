This amendment reduces the one-time transfer in the bill of $600,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 to $300,000 in fiscal year 
2017-18 and adds an additional transfer of $300,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 from the Department oflnland Fisheries 
and Wildlife (IFW) General Fund carrying account and changes the recipient account to the IFW Warden Service 
General Fund account. The recipient account in the bill had been the IFW Licensing and Registration General Fund 
account. The transfers will fund a personal services shortfall in fiscal year 2017-18 that occurred because the savings 
anticipated through attrition did not materialize and for additional financial obligations as a result of changes to 
collective bargaining agreements.
