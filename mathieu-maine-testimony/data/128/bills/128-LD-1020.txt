SUMMARY  24 
Current law allows the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to open to deer 25 
hunting certain coastal and island communities currently closed to hunting, subject to 26 
local approval, and to establish a youth deer hunting day.  This bill requires the 27 
commissioner to open  these communities to deer hunting as long as local restrictions are 28 
imposed.  It requires, while current law permits, the commissioner to create special 29 
hunting seasons to control deer populations.  It requires the commissioner to create 30 
special zones for  deer hunting.  It allows special hunting seasons and special zones to be 31 
created to minimize crop or property damage.  It also requires the commissioner to 32 
establish a youth deer hunting day.  33
