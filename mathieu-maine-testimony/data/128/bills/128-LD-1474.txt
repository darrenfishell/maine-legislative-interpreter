SUMMARY  31 
This bill makes a number of changes to the child care system i n the State.  32 
1.  It repeals Public Law 2011, chapter 380, Part UU, which set the child care subsidy 33 
payment rates of the Department of Health and Human Services at the 50th percentile of 34 
local market rates.  This bill increases the payment rates to the 75t h percentile of local 35 
market rates for payments the department makes on behalf of recipients of benefits under 36 
 
 Page 12 - 128LR0448(01) -1 
 the child care subsidy program, recipients of benefits under TANF and recipients of 1 
benefits under ASPIRE -TANF.  2 
2.  It allows recipients of child  care subsidies to pay the difference out of pocket 3 
between the amount of subsidy received and the amount charged by the child care 4 
provider.  5 
3.  It exempts from licensure family child care providers, nursery schools and small 6 
child care facilities that ca re for fewer than 5 children.  Current law maintains this 7 
exemption for fewer than 3 children.  8 
4.  It establishes a 5 -year license and certification for child care providers that have 9 
been continuously in business without compliance violations.  The cost o f a 5 -year 10 
license or certification is 150% of the current 2 -year license or certification.  11 
5.  It specifies that when an inspection is prompted by a complaint the investigator 12 
may investigate only the specific complaint and not conduct an inspection that is 13 
unrelated to the complaint.  14 
6.  It removes the authority of the department to post complaints and investigation 15 
results on the department's website.  16 
7.  It establishes the Child Care Appeal Review Panel to review disputes related to 17 
the licensing and ce rtification of child care facilities.  This includes revocations, 18 
suspensions, denials, demotions to conditional status, rule compliance issues and denials 19 
of requests for alternative compliance methods.  The review panel members are appointed 20 
by the Gover nor for 5 -year terms.  The director of the office of licensing and regulatory 21 
services within the department is the chair of the panel but does not vote.  The Office of 22 
the Attorney General provides legal counsel to the review panel.  The department is 23 
required to abide by decisions made by the review panel.  24 
8.  It allows a child care provider to employ on a provisional basis an employee for 25 
90 days before receiving a background check report from the Background Check Center.  26 
9.  It requires the department t o develop a sliding scale plan to allow recipients of 27 
child care subsidies to keep part of the subsidy for a period of time after the recipient 28 
earns sufficient income to no longer be eligible for the subsidy.  The Joint Standing 29 
Committee on Health and Hu man Services is authorized to report out a bill relating to 30 
eliminating the so -called welfare cliff with respect to child care subsidies after receiving 31 
the plan.  32 
10.  It requires the department to make a number of changes to rules governing 33 
licensed child  care facilities and certified family child care providers regarding staff -child 34 
ratios, qualifications of staff, providing inspection reports to facilities at the time of 35 
inspection, removing requirements for references for owners and staff, removing 36 
requirements of spare clothing and removing specific requirements for the type of food 37 
provided.  38
