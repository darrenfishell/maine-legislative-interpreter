SUMMARY  23 
This bill gives the Public Utilities Commission the authority to require transmission 24 
and distribution utilities to  take necessary actions to ensure that their systems are 25 
protected from or able to negate effects of geomagnetic disturbances and electromagnetic 26 
pulses. This bill provides that any costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility 27 
as a result of a  directive by the commission are just and reasonable for rate -making 28 
purposes; however, the costs of a failure of a transmission and distribution system 29 
resulting from geomagnetic disturbances or electromagnetic pulses are the responsibility 30 
of the transmi ssion and distribution utility.  31 
The bill also directs the Public Utilities Commission, by July 1, 2018, to direct 32 
transmission and distribution utilities to undertake mitigation measures, including but not 33 
limited to the installation of additional geomagne tically induced current monitoring sites, 34 
neutral current blocking devices and supervisory control and data acquisition system 35 
protectors and the holding of sufficient spare transformers on site to more quickly replace 36 
damaged transformers. Identified meas ures were included in the Public Utilities 37 
Commission report dated January 20, 2014, entitled, "Report to the Legislature Pursuant 38 
to Resolves 2013, Chapter 45, Regarding Geomagnetic Disturbances (GMD) and 39 
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)."  40
