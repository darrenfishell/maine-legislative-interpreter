apparatus if the person in fact has a hypodermic apparatus in possession on the person's 
body and the person in fact fails to inform a law enforcement officer that the person is in 
possession of a hypodermic apparatus on the person's body during the course of any attest 
or detention of the person. 
2. A hypodermic apparatus or the contents of such apparatus is inadmissible as 
evidence in any prosecution for a violation of this chapter if the hypodermic apparatus 
was obtained as a result of the person's informing a law enforcement officer of the 
possession of the hypodermic apparatus as required by subsection 1. 
3. Failure to inform a law enforcement officer of a hypodermic apparatus is a Class
