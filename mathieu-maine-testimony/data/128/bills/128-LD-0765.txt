 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §8301 -A, sub -§1-A, ¶C, as amended by PL 2005, c. 530, §7, 2 
is further amended to read:  3 
C.  "Family child care provider" means a person who provides day care in that 4 
person's home  on a regular basis, for consideration, for 3 6 to 12 children under 13 5 
years of age who are not the children of the provider or who are not residing in the 6 
provider's home.  If a provider is caring for children living in that provider's home 7 
and is caring  for no more than 2 other children, the provider is not required to be 8 
certified as a family child care provider.  9 
SUMMARY  10 
Under current law, a person who provides day care in that person's home must be 11 
certified as a family child care provider if that pers on provides care for 3 to 12 children 12 
who are not the person's own children or who are not residing in the person's home.  This 13 
bill changes the threshold requiring certification as a family child care provider from 14 
caring for 3 children to caring for 6 ch ildren.  15
