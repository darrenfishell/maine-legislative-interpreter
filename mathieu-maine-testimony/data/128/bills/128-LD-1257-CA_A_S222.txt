Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -All Funds 
Eliminating the State's ability to recoup payments to an employee made in error by deducting or withholding amounts 
from subsequent wages may mean recovery in some cases is never accomplished, increasing costs to state departments 
and agencies. It is not possible to estimate the additional costs by fund, agency or fiscal year going forward.
