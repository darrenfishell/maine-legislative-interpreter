Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation may result in the cost of major construction projects undertaken by the State, the University of Maine 
System, the Maine Community College System, Maine Maritime Academy, as well as major school construction 
projects being higher than they would have been absent the requirements of this bill. The fiscal impact can not be 
estimated at this time, but is expected to be significant over time.
