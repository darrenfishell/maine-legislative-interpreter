 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to change the method for providing property tax relief through 5 
State -municipal revenue sharing b y providing benefits directly to property tax payers 6 
through a state tax credit rather than through distributions to municipalities.  The 7 
maximum an individual taxpayer could receive would be 80% of the individual's annual 8 
property tax bill.  The maximum a  corporate taxpayer could receive would be 40% of its 9 
annual property tax bill.   The credit would be calculated as a percentage of the total 10 
revenue sharing funds based on a taxpayer's annual bill, the percentage of total revenue 11 
sharing funds attributabl e to the municipality where the taxpayer's property is located and 12 
the taxpayer's annual property tax liability as a percentage of annual property tax liability 13 
statewide.  14
