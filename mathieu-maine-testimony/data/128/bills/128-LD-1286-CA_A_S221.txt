Required Activity Unit Affected Local Cost 
Requires local school administrative units to submit the names of all employees School Moderate 
subject to certification, approval or authorization and indicate the date on which the statewide 
person most recently conunenced employment with the school administrative unit. 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $13,244 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $13,508 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Leaming Systems program within the Department of Education to fund 90% of the cost to local school 
administrative units to submit the names of all employees subject to certification, approval or authorization along with 
the date that each employee began working for the SAU. These estimates assume that the central office within each 
SAU will be responsible for compiling the data and submitting the report and that the data is up-to-date.
