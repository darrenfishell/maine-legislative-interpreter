 SUMMARY  1 
Part A of this bill creates a pilot project to develop and evaluate a tax simulation 2 
model for state dynamic fiscal analysis of potential changes to the ce rtified visual media 3 
production credit established in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 5219 -Y and 4 
the visual media production reimbursement established in Title 36, section 6902.  The 5 
Department of Economic and Community Development may enter into a memorandum 6 
of understanding with the University of Maine to conduct the pilot project.   The 7 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Maine Revenue Services and the 8 
Office of Fiscal and Program Review are required to evaluate the finding s of the pilot 9 
project and to jointly report to the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation whether the 10 
proposed changes to the visual media production credit and reimbursement would result 11 
in a negative or positive fiscal impact.  12 
Part B of this bill repeals the certified visual media production credit and instead 13 
increases the reimbursement amount for certified production wages paid from 12% to 14 
25% for residents of Maine, increases the cap on the reimbursement of wages from 15 
$50,000 to $100,000 and provides fo r a reimbursement of 20% of nonwage visual media 16 
production expenses.  These changes take effect only if the result of the joint finding of 17 
Maine Revenue Services and the Office of Fiscal and Program Review is that the changes 18 
proposed in this Part would r esult in a positive fiscal impact on state revenue.  19
