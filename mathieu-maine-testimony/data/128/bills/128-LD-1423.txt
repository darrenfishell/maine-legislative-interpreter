charge or any other staff member of the child care facility or family child care provider 26

verifiable documentation of the remedy within 2 weeks of the inspection, the department 39 
may not post information of that deficiency or violation in any public  posting of the 40 
results of the inspection. Any public posting by the department regarding a child care 41 
facility or family child care provider must have the purpose of reasonably informing the 42 
public of an objectively documented deficiency or violation.  43

1673. Membership of the appeals board must include members who represent child care 7

1673 as privately owned independent businesses able to conduct reasonable business 11 
practices outside of the area of the regulated activity.  No later than December 6, 2017, 12
