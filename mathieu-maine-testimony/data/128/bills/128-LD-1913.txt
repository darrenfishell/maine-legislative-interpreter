3 amended to read:
4 1.  Minimum wage.   The minimum  hourly  wage is $7.50  per hour.   Starting January  
5 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour;  starting January 1, 2018, the 
6 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting.  Starting  January 1, 2019 2020, the 
7 minimum hourly wage is $11.00  $10.50 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020 2021, the 
8 minimum hourly wage is $12.00  $11.00 per hour; starting  January  1, 2022, the minimum 
9 hourly wage  is $11.50 per hour; and starting January  1, 2023,  the minimum hourly wage 
10 is $12.00 per hour.  On January  1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum 
11 hourly wage then in effect  must  be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living.  
12 The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as 
13 of August  of the previous  year over the level as of August of the year preceding that year 
14 in the Consumer  Price  Index  for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,  CPI-W, for 
15 the Northeast Region, or its successor  index, as published by the United States 
16 Department of Labor, Bureau  of Labor Statistics  or its successor agency, with the amount 
17 of the minimum  wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.  If the highest 
18 federal minimum wage is increased in excess  of the minimum wage in effect under  this 
19 section, the minimum  wage under this section  is increased to the same amount, effective  
20 on the same date as the increase in the federal  minimum  wage, and must be increased in 
21 accordance with this section  thereafter.
22 SUMMARY
23 This bill:
24 1.  Slows the rate at which the State's minimum  wage  increases by starting with 
25 $10.50 per hour on January 1, 2020 and increasing it by 50¢ per hour each year until it 
26 reaches $12.00 per hour on January 1, 2023; and
