Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $107 ,25 0 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
If approved by the voters, this Constitutional amendment will increase the length oftime over which experience losses 
are amortized from 10 years to 20 years. This will lower the amount of funding needed to pay the required employers 
contributions in years 1 through 10 of any particular experience loss, but increase these payments in years 11 through 
20. The amounts involved will depend on the frequency and magnitude of actual losses experienced.
