 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, in June 2015, the Legislature overwhelmingly approved a $15,000,000 3 
bond issue for senior affordable housing with $14,500,000 for new energy -efficient 4 
affordable homes and the adaptive reuse of structures or homes and $500,000 for home 5 
repair and weatherization programs; and  6 
Whereas, on November 3, 2015, the people of Maine overwhelmingly appro ved the 7 
bond issue, with more than 69% of voters in favor; and  8 
Whereas, the funds from the bond issue will be used to leverage an estimated 9 
$22,600,000 in private and other funds for low -income households headed by a person 55 10 
years of age or older; and  11 
Whereas, state officials and bond counsel have confirmed that the sale of the senior 12 
affordable housing bonds will not affect the State's credit rating; and  13 
Whereas, the bond proceeds will be administered by the Maine State Housing 14 
Authority, which already h as provisions in place to ensure that bond proceeds are used 15 
efficiently, that rent levels remain affordable over the long term, that developer fees will 16 
be capped at a reasonable level and that telemedicine rooms will be made available within 17 
newly constr ucted properties; and  18 
Whereas, over a year has passed and no action has been taken to implement the 19 
voter -approved senior affordable housing bond issue; and  20 
Whereas, there is an urgent need for this new housing, with a current shortage of 21 
more than 9,000 a ffordable homes available for Maine seniors and an expected shortage 22 
of 15,000 homes by 2022 if action is not taken; and  23 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 24 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and requir e the following legislation as 25 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 26 
therefore,  27 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  28 
Sec. 1.  PL 2015, c. 337, ยง1 is amended to read:  29 
Sec. 1.  Author ization of bonds.  The Treasurer of State is authorized , under the 30 
direction of the Governor,  to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 31 
amount not exceeding $15,000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act.  32 
Notwithstanding  the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 145 and section 145 -B, 33 
subsection 2, the bonds issued pursuant to this Act do not require the signature of the 34 
Governor or the attestation of the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial 35 
Services.   The bond s are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may 36 
not run for a period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.  37

 Sec. 2.  PL 2015, c. 337, ยง1 -A is enacted to read:  1 
Sec. 1 -A.  Treasurer of State shall faci litate and expedite issuance of 2 
bonds ratified by voters.   The Treasurer of State shall facilitate and expedite the 3 
issuance of bonds pursuant to this Act, as ratified by the voters of the State, unless:  4 
1.  Debt service greater.   The Treasurer of State de termines that the debt service on 5 
the bonds would be greater than the amount budgeted;  6 
2.  Adverse impact on credit rating.   The Treasurer of State determines that the 7 
issuance of the bonds will adversely affect the credit rating of the State;  8 
3.  Advantag eous interest rate.   The Treasurer of State determines that a delay in 9 
the issuance of the bonds will likely result in a more financially advantageous interest 10 
rate; 11 
4.  Project not proceeding.   The Treasurer of State receives written notification that 12 
a project for which the bonds were authorized is not going forward and the funding to be 13 
provided by the bonds is not required; or  14

notification that alternative funding sources are av ailable to implement, within a 16 
comparable time frame, a project and the purposes for which those bonds were authorized 17 
and ratified.  18 
Upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances set out in subsections 1 to 5, the 19

House of Representatives and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and the 21 
House of Representatives of those circumstances.  22 
Sec. 3.  PL 2015, c. 337, ยง3 is amended to read:  23 
Sec. 3.  Sale; how ne gotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of State 24 
may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor , but no bond may be 25 
loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 26 
bonds, which must be held  by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 27 
upon warrants drawn by the State Controller  to the Maine State Housing Authority , are 28 
appropriated solely for the purposes set forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances 29 
remaining at the comp letion of the project in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer 30 
of State to be used for the retirement of general obligation bonds.  31 
Sec. 4.  Annual report.   Beginning March 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, the 32 
director of the Maine State Housing Au thority shall report to the joint standing committee 33 
of the Legislature having jurisdiction over affordable housing matters on the status of the 34

SUMMARY  7 
In Nov ember 2015, the voters approved Public Law 2015, chapter 337, a bond 8 
authorization to provide for the issuance of bonds to provide funding for the construction 9 
of new energy -efficient affordable homes and the adaptive reuse of structures or homes 10 
for low -income households headed by a person 55 years of age or older.  11 
This bill makes the following changes to that law in order to ensure the issuance of 12 
the approved bonds:  13 
1.  It removes the requirement that the Treasurer of State operate at the direction of 14 
the Governor in issuing and selling the bonds;  15 
2.  It exempts the bonds from the requirements in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, 16 
sections 145 and 145 -B regarding the need for the signature of the Governor and the 17 
attestation of the Commissioner of Admin istrative and Financial Services on bonds issued 18 
and sold by the Treasurer of State;  19 
3.  It places a number of safeguards on the sale of the bonds, including allowing the 20 
Treasurer of State to not sell the bonds if debt service would exceed the amount budg eted 21 
or the issuance of the bonds would have an adverse impact on the State's credit rating; 22 
and 23 
4.  It requires the Treasurer of State to transfer the proceeds of the sale of the bonds 24 
directly to the Maine State Housing Authority, without the requirement  of a warrant 25 
drawn by the State Controller.  26 
The bill also requires the director of the Maine State Housing Authority to report 27 
annually to the Legislature regarding certain aspects of the bond proceeds and the 28 
projects using bond proceeds.  29
