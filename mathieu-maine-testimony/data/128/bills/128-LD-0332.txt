Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 14

SUMMARY  16 
This bill  is emergency legislation.  Consistent with existing Maine and federal law, 17 
this bill makes explicit that a Maine search warrant or a Maine grand jury subpoena may 18 
compel production of records by a provider of electronic communication service or 19 
remote com puting service, even if the provider is outside the State, and establishes the 20 
appropriate procedure for service of such legal process.  Compelling the production of 21 
records will provide access to service provider records that often are critical to the 22 
investigation of crime, as criminals commonly use cell phones, computers and the 23 
Internet in connection with criminal activities.  The federal Stored Communications Act, 24 
18 United States Code, Section 2703(a), (b)(1)(A) and (c)(2) already expressly requires 25 
providers of electronic communication service and remote computing service to comply 26 
with state grand jury subpoenas for basic subscriber information and state search warrants 27 
for content information and location information.  Likewise, under Maine law the 28 
authority to compel production of basic subscriber information with a grand jury 29 
subpoena already exists under the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure, Rule 17 30 
and Rule 17A, and the authority to compel production of content information and location 31 
information with a search warrant already exists under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 32 
16, sections 642 and 648.  This clarification is necessary to resolve uncertainty about the 33 
court's authority under Title 15, section 55 to issue search warrants for re cords in the 34 
possession of entities outside of Maine.  Such uncertainity may impede the investigation 35 
of crimes in Maine and undermine the federal law that requires providers to comply with 36 
state search warrants and grand jury subpoenas.  Emergency legisla tion is necessary to 37 
immediately clarify the court's authority to review requests for criminal process required 38 
for the investigation of alleged criminal activity in Maine.  39
