44 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 657, L.D. 1770 
If an employer's separation report for an employee is not received by the office specified 
on the separation report within 10 days after that report was requested, the claim must be 
adjudicated on the basis of information at hand. If the employer's separation report 
containing possible disqualifying information is received after the 10-day period and the 
claimant is denied benefits by a revised deputy's decision, benefits paid prior to the date 
of the revised decision do not constitute an overpayment of benefits. Any benefits paid 
after the date of the revised decision constitute an overpayment. Only the most recent 
employer from which the claimant's separation occurred may contest whether a 
disqualification may be applied for reasons related to the separation pursuant to section 
1193. 
If an employer files an amended separation report or otherwise raises a new issue as to 
the employee's eligibility or changes the wages or weeks used in determining benefits that 
results in a denial of benefits or a reduction of the weekly benefit amount, the benefits 
paid prior to the date the determination is mailed do not constitute an overpayment. Any 
benefits received after that date to which the claimant is not entitled pursuant to a new 
determination based on that new employer information constitute an overpayment. 
If, during the period a claimant is receiving benefits, new information or a new issue 
arises concerning the claimant's eligibility for benefits or which affects the claimant's 
weekly benefit amount, benefits may not be withheld until a determination is made on the 
issue. Before a determination is made, written notice shall be mailed to the claimant and 
other interested parties, which must include the issue to be decided, the law upon which it 
is based, any factual allegations known to the bureau, the right to a fact-finding interview, 
the date and location of the scheduled interview and the conduct of the interview and 
appeal. The fact-finding interview must be scheduled not less than 5 days nor more than 
14 days after the notice is mailed. The bureau shall include in the notice a statement 
notifying the claimant that any benefits paid prior to the determination may be an 
overpayment under applicable law and recoverable by the bureau if it is later determined 
that the claimant was not entitled to the benefits. If the claimant does not appear for the 
scheduled interview, the deputy shall make a determination on the basis of available 
evidence. The deputy shall make a prompt determination of the issue based solely on any 
written statements of interested parties filed with the bureau before. the interview, 
together with the evidence presented by interested parties who personally appeared at the 
interview. Upon request and notice to all parties at the interview, the deputy may accept 
corroborative documentary evidence after the interview. In no other cas~ may the deputy 
base a decision on evidence received after the interview has been held. 
A. This subsection does not apply when the claimant reports that, in the week 
claimed: 
(1) The claimant worked and reports a specific amount of earnings for that work; 
(2) The claimant worked and had earnings from that work, but does not furnish 
the amount of earnings; 
(3) The claimant reports that the claimant was not able or available for work for 
a specific portion of the week and there is sufficient information for the deputy to 
determine that the inability or unavailability for work was for good cause. If the 
information provided by the claimant indicated unavailability during the claim

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMJTTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 657, L.D. 1770 
1 week, but is not specific as to the amount of time involved, the department shall 
2 immediately initiate a fact-finding interview with the individual and make a 
3 determination regarding the claimant's weekly benefit amount on the basis of that 
4 interview. If the department is not able to conduct an immediate fact-finding 
5 interview with the claimant, the notification and fact-finding process described in 
6 this subsection must be followed; or 
7 ( 4) The claimant received a specific amount of other remuneration as described 
8 in section 1193, subsection 5.' 
9 Amend the bill by adding after section 6 the following:

11 vacancies on the effective date of this Act in positions identified in the Maine Revised 
12 Statutes, Title 26, section 1085, subsection 1 in the manner specified in Title 26, section 
13 1085, subsection 2 no later than 30 days after the effective date of this Act. The staffing 
14 for the positions identified in Title 26, section 1085, subsection 1 that are vacant on the 
15 effective date of this Act must be achieved as soon as possible after the effective date of 
16 this Act, but no later than December 30, 2018. The depa1tment shall recruit and hire 
17 qualified individuals for these vacant positions. 
18 Sec. 8. Correction of problems. Until January 1, 2019, the Department of Labor 
19 shall provide an opportunity for all unemployment insurance claimants denied benefits 
20 for failure to file a timely claim for benefits or work search documentation, as required by

22 during the period from December 1, 2017 until July 1, 2018 to apply for those benefits 
23 and shall grant good cause for failure to file a timely claim for benefits or work search 
24 documentation for those weeks if the claimant asserts that the claimant's inability to use 
25 the department's Internet-based filing system was the basis for the claimant's failure to 
26 file. 
27 Sec. 9. Allocation of money credited to State of Maine account in 
28 Unemployment Trust Fund under Section 903(f) of federal Social Security 
29 Act. Money credited to the account of the State of Maine in the federal Unemployment

33 incurred for the administration of the State's unemployment compensation law and public 
34 employment offices. Money used for the payment of benefits is requisitioned as defined 
35 in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, section 1162. Money requisitioned and used for 
36 the payment of expenses incurred for the administration of the State's unemployment 
37 compensation law and public employment offices requires a specific appropriation by the 
38 Legislature as provided in subsection 1. That use is only permissible if the expenses are 
39 incurred and the money is requisitioned after the effective date of a law making an 
40 appropriation and specifying the purposes for which the money is appropriated and the 
41 amounts appropriated for those purposes. Any amount that may be obligated under such

43 aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of the State of Maine pursuant to 
44 Section 903(f) of the federal Social Security Act exceeds the aggregate of the amounts

22 SUMMARY 
23 This amendment adds several provisions to the bill to make the following changes to 
24 the Employment Security Law. 
25 1. It requires the Department of Labor to fill vacancies for 6 different position types 
26 for which funding is provided; 
27 2. It requires the Department of Labor to provide options to an Internet-based system 
28 for the filing of claims for unemployment benefits, including the filing of work search

system, the department must consider that contact when determining if the claimant had 
good cause for not complying with the requirements to file a timely claim for benefits, 
register for work and actively search for work, file work search documentation or 
participate in reemployment services and eligibility assessment. 
4. It clarifies that only the most recent employer from which the claimant's 
employment separation occurred may contest whether a disqualification may be applied 
to the claimant for reasons related to the separation. 
The amendment also directs the Department of Labor to provide until January 1, 
2019 an opportunity for all unemployment insurance claimants denied benefits for failure 
to file a timely claim for benefits or work search documentation in any week during the 
period from December 1, 2017 until July 1, 2018 to apply for those benefits and provides 
that the Department of Labor must grant good cause for failure to file a timely claim for 
benefits or work search documentation for those weeks if the claimant asserts that the 
claimant's inability to use the department's Internet-based filing system was the basis for 
the claimant's failure to file. 
In 2009, Maine received a $28,200,000 distribution to the Unemployment Trust Fund 
under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5, 
123 Stat. 115 (2009), which may be used to maintain the State's unemployment and 
public employment system or to pay regular unemployment benefits. There is 
$27,503,000 remaining from this distribution. The amendment authorizes the use of 
$895,156 of those funds to meet the allocation required in the amendment. The funds 
will be used to maintain and operate the State's unemployment and employment 
programs, including paying the administrative costs required to administer the 
unemployment insurance program and delivering employment assistance services through 
the Department of Labor's career center system. The intent of the authorization of funds 
is to provide the Department of Labor with funding necessary to implement the 
provisions of this amendment.

This bill includes one-time Federal Expenditures Fund allocations of $812,301 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the 
Employment Security Services program within the Department of Labor to add a voice mail option to the internet­
based system for filing initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits. A portion of unspent 2009 Reed Act 
funds will be used to fund the allocations as follows: $627,301 for 11 limited-period Customer Representative 
· Specialist -Benefits positions, $161,000 to add a First in Line feature to the Interactive Voice Response System that 
manages calls to the claims centers and $24,000 for the annual cost of maintaining the First In Line feature. 
The positions will begin on July 1, 2018 and encl on June 30, 2019. The department has also indicated that filling eight 
vacant customer support positions that are already funded along with the new limited-period positions ,.vill be 
sufficient to implement the voice mail system. 
This fiscal note also reflects the transfer for $82,855 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Labor, Office of the 
Commissioner's Special Revenue Funds account to cover its share of the department's associated indirect costs in 
accordance with the federally approved indirect cost plan. 
LR264 l (02) -Fiscal Note -Page l of 2 
This legislation also requires the Department to immediately fill certain vacant positions for which funding is 
available, including Customer Representative Associate, Customer Representative Specialists, Claims Adjudicator, 
Hearings Examiner, Labor Program Specialist and Field Advisor and Examiner. A query of the State's data 
warehouse indicates that there are currently 30 vacant positions with these job class titles. These vacant positions have 
already been budgeted. The 8 needed for the voice mail system are included in the 30. 
Changes made in this legislation regarding how benefits paid to an eligible individual under the Employment Security 
Law are charged against the experience rating record of the individual's previous employers will have no fiscal impact 
on the Unemployment Trust Fund or the employer contribution rate schedule currently in effect. However, the 
Department of Labor will incur one-time Federal Expenditures Fund costs of approximately $900,000 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to make the necessary programming updates in order to implement the change. The Department has 
indicated that it has federal funds available for this purpose.
