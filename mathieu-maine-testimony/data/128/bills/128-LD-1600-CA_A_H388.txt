20 This amendment provides that the tax on opioids that the bill proposes must be paid 
21 by manufacturers of opioids that are distributed in the State and changes the rate of tax to 
22 0.1 ¢ per morphine milligram equivalent. The amendment removes wholesalers from the 
23 provisions of the bill and a provision basing the tax on the first sale within the State. The 
24 amendment excludes from the tax opioids that are used in medication-assisted treatment 
25 of substance use disorder and directs the Maine Board of Pharmacy to provide a list of 
26 those medications to the State Tax Assessor annually. 
27 The amendment strikes from the bill the section establishing the Opioid Addiction 
28 Prevention and Rehabilitation Program and provides that revenue from the tax must be 
29 deposited in a special account to be used by the Department of Health and Human 
30 Services for the Opioid Health Home Program. 
31 The amendment authorizes the State Tax Assessor to adopt rules to facilitate 
32 administration of this tax including requiring pharmacies or other persons in the State to 
33 provide information identifying manufacturers of opioids distributed in the State and the 
34 volume of opioids distributed by each manufacturer.
