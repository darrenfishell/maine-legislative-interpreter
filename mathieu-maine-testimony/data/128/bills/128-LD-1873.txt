Page 1 - 128LR2934(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 PART A
3 Sec. A-1.  22 MRSA §3104-A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 368, Pt. OO, §§1 and 
4 2, is repealed.
5 Sec. A-2.  22 MRSA §3273,  sub-§9,  as enacted by PL 1997, c. 643, Pt. WW, §1, 
6 is repealed.
7 Sec. A-3.  22 MRSA  §3762, sub-§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. 
8 NNNNNNN, §10  and c. 290, §1, is  further  amended to read:
9 B.  The department  may use funds, insofar as resources  permit,  provided under and in 
10 accordance with the United States Social  Security Act or state funds appropriated  for 
11 this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide  assistance to 
12 families under this chapter.   In addition to assistance for families described  in this 
13 subsection, funds must be expended for the  following  purposes:
14 (1)  To continue the pass- through of the first $50 per month of current child 
15 support collections  and the exclusion of the $50 pass- through from the budget 
16 tests and benefit calculations;
17 (2)  To provide financial  assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United  
18 States who are receiving  assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  
19 Recipients of assistance  under this subparagraph are limited to the categories  of 
20 noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF  programs but for their status as 
21 aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility  for the TANF program for these categories of 
22 noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 
23 assistance from the TANF  program.  Any household receiving assistance as of  
24 July 1, 2011 may continue to receive  assistance, as long as that household 
25 remains eligible, without regard to interruptions  in coverage or gaps in eligibility 
26 for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither  
27 receiving assistance  on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance  
28 on July 1, 2011  that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 
29 through a state- funded  program unless that  noncitizen is:
30 (a)  Elderly  or disabled, as described under the laws governing supplemental 
31 security income in 42 United States Code,  Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);
32 (b)  A victim of domestic violence; 
33 (c)  Experiencing  other hardship, such as time necessary to obtain proper 
34 work documentation, as defined  by the department by rule. Rules adopted  by 
35 the department under this division are routine  technical rules  as defined by 
36 Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A; or
37 (d)  Unemployed but has obtained proper  work documentation, as defined by 
38 the department  by rule.  Rules adopted by the department under this division 
39 are routine technical rules as defined  by Title  5, chapter  375, subchapter 2-A;
Page 2 - 128LR2934(01)-11 (3) To provide benefits to certain 2-parent families whose deprivation is based  on 
2 physical or mental incapacity;
3 (4)  To provide  an assistance  program for needy children,  19 to 21 years of age, 
4 who are in full-time attendance in secondary school.  The program  is operated for 
5 those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United  States  Social  Security  
6 Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated  for the 
7 parent or caretaker relative of those individuals.  Except for the age requirement, 
8 all provisions of TANF, including the standard of need and the amount of 
9 assistance, apply to the program established pursuant to this subparagraph;
10 (5)  To provide  assistance for a pregnant woman who is otherwise  eligible for 
11 assistance under this chapter, except that she has no dependents under  19 years  of 
12 age.  An individual is eligible  for the monthly benefit for one eligible person  if 
13 the medically substantiated expected date of the birth of her child is not more  
14 than 90 days  following  the date  the benefit is  received;
15 (6)  To provide a special housing allowance for TANF  families  whose shelter  
16 expenses for rent, mortgage or similar  payments,  homeowners insurance and 
17 property taxes equal or exceed 50% of their monthly income.  The special 
18 housing allowance is limited  to $200 per month for each family.  For purposes of 
19 this subparagraph, "monthly income" means  the total of the TANF monthly 
20 benefit and all income  countable under the TANF program, plus child  support 
21 received by the family, excluding the $50 pass-through payment;
22 (7)  In determining  benefit levels for TANF recipients  who have earnings from 
23 employment, the department shall disregard from monthly earnings the 
24 following:
25 (a)  One hundred  and eight dollars;
26 (b)  Fifty percent of the remaining  earnings that are less than the federal 
27 poverty level;  and
28 (c)  All actual  child  care costs necessary for work,  except that the department 
29 may limit  the child  care disregard to $175 per month per child or $200 per 
30 month per  child under 2 years of age or  with special  needs;
31 (7-A)  In determining eligibility  and benefit  levels, the department may apply a 
32 gross income  test only to applicants  and not to recipients;
33 (7-B)  In addition to the earned income disregards  provided in subparagraph (7), 
34 a TANF recipient who enters employment must receive a one-time employment 
35 incentive payment of $400 if that TANF  recipient retains  employment for the 
36 subsequent 4 months  after entering employment, to be paid at the end of that 4-
37 month period.   This subparagraph is  repealed  December 31, 2018;
38 (8)  In cases when  the TANF recipient has no child care cost, the monthly TANF 
39 benefit is the maximum payment level or the difference between the countable  
40 earnings and the standard of need established by rule adopted by the department, 
41 whichever is  lower;
Page 3 - 128LR2934(01)-11 (9)  In cases when the TANF recipient has child  care costs, the department shall 
2 determine a total benefit package,  including TANF cash assistance, determined in 
3 accordance with subparagraph (7) and additional child care assistance, as 
4 provided by rule, necessary to cover  the TANF  recipient's actual child care costs 
5 up to the maximum  amount specified in section 3782-A, subsection 5.  The 
6 benefit amount must be paid as provided in this subparagraph.
7 (a)  Before the first month in which child  care assistance is available to an 
8 ASPIRE-TANF recipient  under this paragraph and periodically thereafter, the 
9 department shall notify the recipient of the total benefit package  and the 
10 following options  of the recipient: to receive  the total benefit package 
11 directly; or to have the department pay the recipient's child care assistance 
12 directly to the designated child care provider for the recipient and pay the 
13 balance of the total benefit package to the recipient.
14 (b)  If an ASPIRE-TANF recipient notifies  the department  that the recipient 
15 chooses to receive the child care assistance  directly, the department shall  pay 
16 the total benefit package to the recipient.
17 (c)  If an ASPIRE-TANF  recipient does not respond or notifies the 
18 department of the choice  to have  the child care assistance paid directly  to the 
19 child care provider from  the total benefit  package,  the department shall pay 
20 the child care assistance  directly to the designated child care provider  for the 
21 recipient.  The department  shall pay the balance  of the total benefit package  
22 to the recipient;
23 (10)  Child  care assistance under this paragraph  must be paid by the department 
24 in a prompt  manner that permits an ASPIRE-TANF recipient to access child  care 
25 necessary for work;  and
26 (11)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375 to 
27 implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subparagraph are 
28 routine technical rules  as defined  in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
