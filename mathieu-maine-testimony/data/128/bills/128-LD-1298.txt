 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §361 -A, sub -§1-L is enacted to read:  2 
1-L.  CFU.  "CFU" means colony -forming units.  3 
Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §464, sub -§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 193, §1, is 4 
further amended to re ad: 5 
A.  Notwithstanding section 414 -A, the department may not issue a water discharge 6 
license for any of the following discharges:  7 
(1)  Direct discharge of pollutants to waters having a drainage area of less than 10 8 
square miles, except that:  9 
(a)  Discharg es into these waters that were licensed prior to January 1, 1986 10 
are allowed to continue only until practical alternatives exist;  11 
(b)  Storm water discharges in compliance with state and local requirements 12 
are exempt from this subparagraph;  13 
(c)  Aquatic pe sticide or chemical discharges approved by the department and 14 
conducted by the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and 15 
Wildlife or an agent of either agency for the purpose of restoring biological 16 
communities affected by an invasive species are exempt from this 17 
subparagraph;  18 
(d)  Chemical discharges for the purpose of restoring water quality in GPA 19 
waters approved by the department are exempt from this subparagraph;  20 
(e)  Discharges of aquatic pesticides approved by the department for the 21 
contro l of mosquito -borne diseases in the interest of public health and safety 22 
using materials and methods that provide for protection of nontarget species 23 
are exempt from this subparagraph.  When the department issues a license for 24 
the discharge of aquatic pest icides authorized under this division, the 25 
department shall notify the municipality in which the application is licensed 26 
to occur and post the notice on the department's publicly accessible website; 27 
and 28 
(f)  Discharges of pesticides approved by the departm ent are exempt from 29 
this subparagraph that are:  30 
(i)  Unintended and an incidental result of the spraying of pesticides;  31 
(ii)  Applied in compliance with federal labeling restrictions; and  32 
(iii)  Applied in compliance with statute, Board of Pesticides Contr ol 33 
rules and best management practices .; 34 
(2)  New direct discharge of domestic pollutants to tributaries of Class -GPA 35 
waters;  36 
(3)  Any discharge into a tributary of GPA waters that by itself or in combination 37 
with other activities causes water quality degr adation that would impair the 38 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0738(01) -1 
 characteristics and designated uses of downstream GPA waters or causes an 1 
increase in the trophic state of those GPA waters except for the following: ; 2 
(a)  Aquatic pesticide or chemical discharges approved by the department an d 3 
conducted by the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and 4 
Wildlife or an agent of either agency for the purpose of restoring biological 5 
communities affected by an invasive species in the GPA waters or a tributary 6 
to the GPA waters; or  7 
(b)  Disc harges of pesticides approved by the department that are:  8 
(i)  Unintended and an incidental result of the spraying of pesticides;  9 
(ii)  Applied in compliance with federal labeling restrictions; and  10 
(iii)  Applied in compliance with statute, Board of Pestic ides Control 11 
rules and best management practices.  12 
(4)  Discharge of pollutants to waters of the State that imparts color, taste, 13 
turbidity, toxicity, radioactivity or other properties that cause those waters to be 14 
unsuitable for the designated uses and cha racteristics ascribed to their class;  15 
(5)  Discharge of pollutants to any water of the State that violates sections 465, 16 
465-A and 465 -B, except as provided in section 451; causes the "pH" of fresh 17 
waters to fall outside of the 6.0 to 8.5 range; or causes the "pH" of estuarine and 18 
marine waters to fall outside of the 7.0 to 8.5 range;  19 
(6)  New discharges of domestic pollutants to the surface waters of the State that 20 
are not conveyed and treated in municipal or quasi -municipal sewage facilities.  21 
For the pur poses of this subparagraph, "new discharge" means any overboard 22 
discharge that was not licensed as of June 1, 1987, except discharges from 23 
vessels and those discharges that were in continuous existence for the 12 months 24 
preceding June 1, 1987, as demonstra ted by the applicant to the department with 25 
clear and convincing evidence.  The volume of the discharge from an overboard 26 
discharge facility that was licensed as of June 1, 1987 is determined by the actual 27 
or estimated volume from the facilities connected to the overboard discharge 28 
facility during the 12 months preceding June 1, 1987 or the volume allowed by 29 
the previous license, whichever is less, unless it is found by the department that 30 
an error was made during prior licensing.  The months during which a  discharge 31 
may occur from an overboard discharge facility that was licensed as of June 1, 32 
1987 must be determined by the actual use of the facility at the time of the most 33 
recent license application prior to June 1, 1987 or the actual use of the facility 34 
during the 12 months prior to June 1, 1987, whichever is greater.  If the 35 
overboard discharge facility was the primary residence of an owner at the time of 36 
the most recent license application prior to June 1, 1987 or during the 12 months 37 
prior to June 1, 19 87, then the facility is considered a year -round residence.  38 
"Year -round residence" means a facility that is continuously used for more than 8 39 
months of the year.  For purposes of licensing, the department shall treat an 40 
increase in the licensed volume or quantity of an existing discharge or an 41 
expansion in the months during which the discharge takes place as a new 42 
discharge of domestic pollutants;  43 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0738(01) -1 
 (7)  After the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection 1 
Agency ceases issuing permits for d ischarges of pollutants to waters of this State 2 
pursuant to the administrator's authority under the Federal Water Pollution 3 
Control Act, Section 402(c)(1), any proposed license to which the administrator 4 
has formally objected under 40 Code of Federal Regul ations, Section 123.44, as 5 
amended, or any license that would not provide for compliance with applicable 6 
requirements of that Act or regulations adopted thereunder;  7 
(8)  Discharges for which the imposition of conditions can not ensure compliance 8 
with appli cable water quality requirements of this State or another state;  9 
(9)  Discharges that would, in the judgment of the Secretary of the United States 10 
Army, substantially impair anchorage or navigation;  11 
(10)  Discharges that would be inconsistent with a plan o r plan amendment 12 
approved under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 208(b); and  13 
(11)  Discharges that would cause unreasonable degradation of marine waters or 14 
when insufficient information exists to make a reasonable judgment whether the 15 
disch arge would cause unreasonable degradation of marine waters.  16 
Notwithstanding subparagraph (6), the department may issue a wastewater discharge 17 
license allowing for an increase in the volume or quantity of discharges of domestic 18 
pollutants from any universit y, college or school administrative unit sewage facility, 19 
as long as the university, college or school administrative unit has a wastewater 20 
discharge license valid on the effective date of this paragraph and the increase in 21 
discharges does not violate the conditions of subparagraphs (1) to (5) and (7) to (11) 22 
or other applicable laws.  23 
Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §464, sub -§4, ¶D, as amended by PL 1991, c. 159, is further 24 
amended to read:  25 
D.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, for the purpose of computing 26 
whether a discharge will violate the classification of any river or stream, the 27 
assimilative capacity of the river or stream must be computed using the minimum 7 - 28 
day low flow which  that can be expected to occur with a frequency of once in 10 29 
years.  The de partment may use a different flow rate only for those toxic substances 30 
regulated under section 420 and for those nutrients specified in department rules .  To 31 
use a different flow rate, the department must find that the flow rate is consistent with 32 
the risk  being addressed.  33 
Sec. 4.  38 MRSA §465, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2005, c. 409, §1, is 34 
further amended to read:  35 
B.  The dissolved oxygen content of Class B waters may not be less than 7 parts per 36 
million or 75% of saturation, whichever is higher, excep t that for the period from 37 
October 1st to May 14th, in order to ensure spawning and egg incubation of 38 
indigenous fish species, the 7 -day mean dissolved oxygen concentration may not be 39 
less than 9.5 parts per million and the 1 -day minimum dissolved oxygen 40 
concentration may not be less than 8.0 parts per million in identified fish spawning 41 
areas.  Between May 15th and September 30th, the number of Escherichia coli 42 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR0738(01) -1 
 bacteria of human and domestic animal origin in these waters may not exceed a 1 
geometric mean of 64 100 CFU  per 100 milliliters over a 90 -day interval  or an 2 
instantaneous level of 236  320 CFU  per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the 3 
samples in any 90 -day interval .  In determining human and domestic animal origin, 4 
the department shall assess license d and unlicensed sources using available 5 
diagnostic procedures.  6 
Sec. 5.  38 MRSA §465, sub -§3, ¶C, as amended by PL 2007, c. 291, §4, is 7 
further amended to read:  8 
C.  Discharges to Class B waters may not cause adverse impact to aquatic life in that 9 
the rece iving waters must be of sufficient quality to support all aquatic species 10 
indigenous to the receiving water without detrimental changes in the resident 11 
biological community.   12 
(1) This paragraph does not apply to aquatic pesticide or chemical discharges 13 
approved by the department and conducted by the department, the Department of 14 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or an agent of either agency for the purpose of 15 
restoring biological communities affected by an invasive species.  16 
(2)  For the purpose of allowing the  discharge of aquatic pesticides approved by 17 
the department for the control of mosquito -borne diseases in the interest of public 18 
health and safety, the department may find that the discharged effluent will not 19 
cause adverse impact to aquatic life as long a s the materials and methods used 20 
provide protection for nontarget species.  When the department issues a license 21 
for the discharge of aquatic pesticides authorized under this subparagraph, the 22 
department shall notify the municipality in which the applicati on is licensed to 23 
occur and post the notice on the department's publicly accessible website.  24 
Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §465, sub -§4, ¶B, as repealed and replaced by PL 2005, c. 25 
409, §2, is amended to read:  26 
B.  The dissolved oxygen content of Class C water may be no t less than 5 parts per 27 
million or 60% of saturation, whichever is higher, except that in identified salmonid 28 
spawning areas where water quality is sufficient to ensure spawning, egg incubation 29 
and survival of early life stages, that water quality sufficie nt for these purposes must 30 
be maintained.  In order to provide additional protection for the growth of indigenous 31 
fish, the following standards apply.  32 
(1)  The 30 -day average dissolved oxygen criterion of a Class C water is 6.5 parts 33 
per million using a te mperature of 22 degrees centigrade or the ambient 34 
temperature of the water body, whichever is less, if:  35 
(a)  A license or water quality certificate other than a general permit was 36 
issued prior to March 16, 2004 for the Class C water and was not based on a 37 
6.5 parts per million 30 -day average dissolved oxygen criterion; or  38 
(b)  A discharge or a hydropower project was in existence on March 16, 2005 39 
and required but did not have a license or water quality certificate other than 40 
a general permit for the Class C  water.  41 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0738(01) -1 
 This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and water quality certificates 1 
issued on or after March 16, 2004.  2 
(2)  In Class C waters not governed by subparagraph (1), dissolved oxygen may 3 
not be less than 6.5 parts per million as a 30 -day average based upon a 4 
temperature of 24 degrees centigrade or the ambient temperature of the water 5 
body, whichever is less.  This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and 6 
water quality certificates issued on or after March 16, 2004.  7 
The departm ent may negotiate and enter into agreements with licensees and water 8 
quality certificate holders in order to provide further protection for the growth of 9 
indigenous fish.  Agreements entered into under this paragraph are enforceable as 10 
department orders ac cording to the provisions of sections 347 -A to 349.  11 
Between May 15th and September 30th, the number of Escherichia coli bacteria of 12 
human and domestic animal origin in Class C waters may not exceed a geometric 13 
mean of 126 100 CFU  per 100 milliliters over a  90-day interval  or an instantaneous 14 
level of 236  320 CFU  per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the samples in any 90 - 15 
day interval .  In determining human and domestic animal origin, the department shall 16 
assess licensed and unlicensed sources using availa ble diagnostic procedures.  The 17 
board shall adopt rules governing the procedure for designation of spawning areas. 18 
Those rules must include provision for periodic review of designated spawning areas 19 
and consultation with affected persons prior to designati on of a stretch of water as a 20 
spawning area.  21 
Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §465, sub -§4, ¶C, as amended by PL 2005, c. 182, §5, is 22 
further amended to read:  23 
C.  Discharges to Class C waters may cause some changes to aquatic life, except that 24 
the receiving waters must be  of sufficient quality to support all species of fish 25 
indigenous to the receiving waters and maintain the structure and function of the 26 
resident biological community.  This paragraph does not apply to aquatic pesticide or 27 
chemical discharges approved by th e department and conducted by the department, 28 
the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or an agent of either agency for the 29 
purpose of restoring biological communities affected by an invasive species.  30 
Sec. 8.  38 MRSA §465 -A, sub -§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2007, c. 292, §23, is 31 
further amended to read:  32 
B.  Class GPA waters must be described by their trophic state based on measures of 33 
the chlorophyll "a" content, Secchi disk transparency, total phosphorus content and 34 
other appropriate criteria. Class GP A waters must have a stable or decreasing trophic 35 
state, subject only to natural fluctuations and must be free of culturally induced algal 36 
blooms that impair their use and enjoyment.  The number of Escherichia coli bacteria 37 
of human and domestic animal ori gin in these waters may not exceed a geometric 38 
mean of 29 100 CFU  per 100 milliliters over a 90 -day interval  or an instantaneous 39 
level of 194  320 CFU  per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the samples in any 90 - 40 
day interval . 41 
Sec. 9.  38 MRSA §465 -B, sub -§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2005, c. 409, §3, is 42 
further amended to read:  43 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0738(01) -1 
 B.  The dissolved oxygen content of Class SB waters must be not less than 85% of 1 
saturation.  Between May 15th and September 30th, the numbers of enterococcus 2 
bacteria of human and domes tic animal origin in these waters may not exceed a 3 
geometric mean of 8 30 CFU  per 100 milliliters in any 90 -day interval  or an 4 
instantaneous level of 54  110 CFU  per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the 5 
samples in any 90 -day interval .  In determining hum an and domestic animal origin, 6 
the department shall assess licensed and unlicensed sources using available 7 
diagnostic procedures.  The numbers of total coliform bacteria or other specified 8 
indicator organisms in samples representative of the waters in shel lfish harvesting 9 
areas may not exceed the criteria recommended under the National Shellfish 10 
Sanitation Program, United States Food and Drug Administration.  11 
Sec. 10.  38 MRSA §465 -B, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2005, c. 409, §4, is 12 
further amended to read:  13 
B.  The dissolved oxygen content of Class SC waters must be not less than 70% of 14 
saturation.  Between May 15th and September 30th, the numbers of enterococcus 15 
bacteria of human and domestic animal origin in these waters may not exceed a 16 
geometric mean of 14 30 CFU  per 100 milliliters in any 90 -day interval  or an 17 
instantaneous level of 94  110 CFU  per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of the 18 
samples in any 90 -day interval .  In determining human and domestic animal origin, 19 
the department shall assess licensed and unlicensed sources using available 20 
diagnostic procedures.  The numbers of total coliform bacteria or other specified 21 
indicator organisms in samples representative of the waters in restricted shellfish 22 
harvesting areas may not exceed the criteria recomm ended under the National 23 
Shellfish Sanitation Program, United States Food and Drug Administration.  24 
SUMMARY  25 
This bill updates Maine's water quality standards by aligning state law with the 26 
federal Clean Water Act regarding pesticide application to control i nvasive plants and 27 
mosquito -borne disease and authorizing the Department of Environmental Protection to 28 
use an alternative low -flow requirement when assessing the impact of nutrients on water 29 
quality, contingent upon the department's adopting nutrient rule s. 30
