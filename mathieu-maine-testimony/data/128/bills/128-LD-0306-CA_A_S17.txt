24 This amendment, which is the majority report, provides that the Secretary of State 
25 may issue a driver's license or nondriver identification card that meets the standards of the 
26 federal REAL ID Act of 2005. The amendment also establishes fees for REAL ID 
27 compliant driver's licenses and nondriver identification cards. 
28 Current law allows the Secretary of State to exempt a person from having to present 
29 documentary evidence of legal presence in the United States if that person is renewing a 
30 noncommercial driver's license and that person has continuously held a valid driver's 
31 license since December 31, 1989 or was born before December 1, 1964. Current law also 
32 provides that the Secretary of State may exempt a person from having to present 
33 documentary evidence of legal presence for a nondriver identification card if that person 
34 has held a nondriver identification card or valid driver's license since December 31, 1989 
35 or was born before December 1, 1964. This amendment repeals these exemptions in 
36 order for the Secretary of State to comply with the requirements of the federal REAL ID 
37 Act of 2005.
