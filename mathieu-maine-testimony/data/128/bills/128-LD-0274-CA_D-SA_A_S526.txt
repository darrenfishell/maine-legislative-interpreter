amended by the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 
Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105. A transfer must be made pursuant to a

This amendment requires that the fees for and costs related to processing and administering the criminal background 
checks required for a child care staff member must be paid by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 
from the funds available under the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and further requires a 
transfer of payment by the DHHS to the Department of Public Safety (DPS) from the federal CCDBG must be made 
pursuant to a schedule agreed upon by the DHHS and the DPS in consultation with the State Controller and based on 
documentation of fees and costs. It is estimated that the DHHS will transfer a total of 68,492 to the DPS accounts to 
offset the costs incurred by the bill. 
Additionally, the amendment includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $56,294 in fiscal year 2018-19 t'­
the DHHS to fund the one Office Associate II Supervisor position to handle additional work from the increase in 
background checks, utilizing CCDBG funds instead of General Fund dollars. The amendment also includes Federal 
Block Grant Fund allocations of $124,786 in fiscal year 2018-19 to fund both positions created within DPS and 
DHHS with CCDBG funds.
