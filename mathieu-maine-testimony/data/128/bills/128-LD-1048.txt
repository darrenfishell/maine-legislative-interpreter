This bill requires the use of the Uniform Summons and Complaint form for criminal 16 
violations of the Maine Revised Statutes, Titles 12, 17 -A and 29 -A and the Violation 17 
Summons and Complaint for civil violations of those titles.  This bill requires the 18 
Violation Summons and Complaint form to be the same for m as that currently used for 19 
traffic infractions and standardizes the use, including the issuance and disposition, of that 20 
form by law enforcement officers and the Maine Warden Service.  21 
This bill specifies that district attorneys are required to prosecute only criminal 22 
violations of the inland fisheries and wildlife laws and removes references to citations, 23 
which are no longer used by the warden service.  24
