Fiscal Note 
Future biem1ium revenue decrease -General Fund 
Provisions allowing a violator of an environmental law to offset up to 100% of an assessed civil penalty by 
conducting a supplemental environmental project, instead of the 80% offset in cun-ent law, may decrease future 
General Fund revenue. Any additional costs to the Department of Enviromnental Protection as a result of adopting 
the recommendations resulting from a State Government Evaluation Act Review are expected to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
