SUMMARY 
This amendment authorizes a student enrolled in a dental assisting program to 
practice under the supervision of the student's instructors without first obtaining a license 
from the Board of Dental Practice. The amendment also removes an unnecessary 
definition and clarifies that the crime of unlawful practice applies whenever a person 
employs an unlicensed person to provide services for which a license is required by the 
Dental Practice Act. 
The bill eliminates the charitable dentist license and clinical dentist educator license 
categories. The amendment clarifies that a charitable dentist license and a clinical dentist 
educator license issued by the Board of Dental Practice and in effect on the effective date 
of this legislation remain in effect until the date of expiration specified in the license.
