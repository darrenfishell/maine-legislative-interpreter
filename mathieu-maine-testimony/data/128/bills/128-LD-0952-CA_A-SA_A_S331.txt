SENATE AMENDMENT 
SENATE AMENDMENT 'A "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 307, L.D. 952 
1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment amends Committee Amendment "A" by striking the requirement 
3 that the Department of Health and Human Services conduct a rate study, striking the 
4 provision mandating that the department increase the reimbursement rate for outpatient 
5 opioid treatment providers and adding language permitting the department to increase 
6 that rate if the department finds an increase to be justified. In addition, the amendment 
7 gives the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services the authority to report 
8 out legislation to the Second Regular Session of the 128th Legislature to increase the 
9 reimbursement rate for outpatient opioid treatment providers. With the removal of the 2 
10 initiatives requiring appropriations and allocations, the amendment strikes the 
11 appropriations and allocations section.

The amendment removes the requirement for an increase in the rate for outpatient opioid treatment, instead allowing 
the Department of Health and Human Services to change the rate if they determine it is justified. The amendment also 
removes the requirement for a 3rd party consultant to conduct a rate study. These were the two requirements in the bill 
that necessitated funding, so the appropriation and allocation section is removed from this bill.
