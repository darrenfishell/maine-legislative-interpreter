This amendment removes the requirement for a notice to the taxpayer of potential eligibility to file for tax abatement. 
As the mandate for a separate notice is removed, the costs anticipated from increased abatement activity originating 
from the notification would not be considered mandated costs and the General Fund appropriation is reduced by 
$823,005 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The mandated requirements to engage a real estate broker, sell the 
property at fair market value or the price anticipated by the broker and remit excess proceeds to the taxpayer remain in 
the bill. As amended, the bill still contains an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $2,250 beginning in fiscal year 
2018-19 to cover these costs. This amount represents 90% of the estimated net cost to municipalities not recovered 
through the sale of the property.
