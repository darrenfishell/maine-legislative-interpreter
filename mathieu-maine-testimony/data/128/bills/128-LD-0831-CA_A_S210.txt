Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The requirement that the minimum wage for Maine not exceed the average minimum wage paid in the New England 
states will result in savings to the State and to municipalities beginning in calendar year 2018. At the present time, the 
average minimum wage in New England is $9.49 per hour versus $9.00 per hour in Maine required pursuant to Title 
26, §664, sub-§1. Absent any change in current law, the average for New England will climb to $9.74 per hour in 
2018 and $9.91 per hour in calendar year 2019, which is $0.26 below the $10.00 per hour required minimum wage for 
Maine in 2018 and $1.09 per hour less than the $11.00 per hour minimum wage for Maine required in 2019.
