20 SUMMARY 
21 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment repeals the provision of law that 
22 allows a snowmobile registered in another state or the Canadian province of New 
23 Brunswick or Quebec to operate in Maine for at least 3 consecutive days without being 
24 registered in this State if that other state or province extends that reciprocity to a 
25 snowmobile registered in this State. Instead, this amendment allows the Commissioner of 
26 Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish one 3-day period annually during which a 
27 nonresident may operate in Maine a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle registered in 
28 another state or any Canadian province.
