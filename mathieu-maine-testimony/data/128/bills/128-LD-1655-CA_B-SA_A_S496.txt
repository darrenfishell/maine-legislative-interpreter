SUMMARY 2018-19 
$229,000 
$229,000 
This amendment replaces Committee Amendment "B" except for the substitute title 
and does the following. 
Part A updates references to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
contained in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36 to refer to the United States Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 as amended through March 23, 2018 for tax years beginning on or 
after January 1, 2017 and for any prior tax years as specifically provided by the United 
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Part A primarily affects the State's 
income and estate tax laws. 
Part B makes the following changes to the individual income tax. 
1. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, it changes the Maine standard 
deduction to conform to the federal standard deduction and increases the amount at which 
the standard deduction begins to phase out. 
2. It increases Maine itemized deductions by the amount of real and personal 
property taxes not claimed for federal income tax pmposes as a result of the $10,000 
limitation, which is $5,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return, 
applicable to the aggregate of state, local and foreign income taxes, or state and local 
general sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes, and property taxes. Both the 
federal limitation and the increase in Maine itemized deductions apply to tax years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. 
3. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, it increases the amount at 
which the Maine itemized deduction begins to phase out. 
4. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the amendment establishes a 
Maine personal exemption deduction amount equal to $4,150 that may be claimed by a 
taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse if the taxpayer is married filing a joint return. The 
personal exemption deduction amount is subject to phase-out for higher-income 
taxpayers. The personal exemption amount and phase-out thresholds are subject to an 
annual inflation adjustment. The personal exemption deduction may not be claimed for a 
taxpayer or a taxpayer's spouse who is claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's 
return. 
5. It amends the sales tax fairness credit and the property tax fairness credit by 
replacing references to the number of exemptions claimed on the taxpayer's return with 
references to dependents claimed under the federal child tax credit and removing the 
requirement to add the federal domestic production activities deduction to income for 
pmposes of the programs in response to federal tax changes made in the federal Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017. It also provides for the adjustment for inflation of the sales tax 
fairness credit and the property tax fairness credit beginning in 2019. Finally, it increases 
the property tax fairness credit to 100% of the benefit base above 6% of the resident 
Page 21 -128LR2770(07)-1 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
SENATE AMENDMENT" A "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "B" to S.P. 612, L.D. 1655 
1 individual's income and increases the credit cap to $750 for individuals and $1,200 for 
2 individuals over 65 years of age. 
3 6. It establishes a new tax credit equal to $300 for each qualifying child and 
4 dependent of the taxpayer for whom the federal child tax credit pursuant to the Internal 
5 Revenue Code, Section 24 is claimed for the same taxable year. The new credit is 
6 available for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. 
7 Part C makes the following changes to the individual and corporate income taxes. 
8 1. It eliminates Maine's domestic production activities deduction income 
9 modification. The related federal deduction is repealed for tax years beginning on or after 
10 January 1, 2018. 
11 2. It enacts modifications that reverse, for Maine tax purposes, the effects of the new 
12 federal limitation on the net operating loss deduction. 
13 3. It requires that any amount claimed as a special deduction provided by the Internal 
14 Revenue Code, Section 199A must be added back to federal taxable income for purposes 
15 of calculating income tax liability of estates and trusts under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
16 Title 36, chapters 809 and 811. Individual taxpayers are not allowed the special deduction 
17 provided by the Internal Revenue Code, Section 199A in calculating Maine taxable 
18 income; this section provides similar treatment to estates and trusts. 
19 4. It eliminates the application of the alternative minimum tax to corporate income 
20 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
21 Part D makes the following corporate income tax changes regarding the federal 
22 mandatory repatriation of deferred foreign income under the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs 
23 Act of 2017, the taxation of dividends, subpart F income as defined in Section 952 of the 
24 Internal Revenue Code, or "Code," and global intangible low-taxed income. 
25 1. It creates an addition modification in the amount of the participation exemption 
26 claimed in accordance with the Code, Section 965(c). This provision applies to tax years 
27 beginning on or after January 1, 2017. 
28 2. It creates an addition modification in the amount of the global intangible low-
29 taxed income deduction claimed in accordance with the Code, Section 250(a)(l)(B). This 
30 provision applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. 
31 3. It makes technical clarifications, removing obsolete language from the existing 
32 dividends-received subtraction, clarifying netting and sales factor treatment consistent 
33 with administrative practice and excluding from dividend income subpart F income, 
34 global intangible low-taxed income included in federal taxable income in accordance 
35 with the Code, Section 951A and deferred foreign income included in federal taxable 
36 income in accordance with the Code, Section 965. This provision applies to tax years 
37 beginning on or after January 1, 2017. 
38 4. It creates a subtraction modification for an amount equal to 50% of the 
39 apportionable subpart F income included in federal gross income by the taxpayer. This 
40 section codifies the longstanding administrative practice of applying the existing 
41 dividends-received subtraction to subpart F income, as well as dividends. This provision 
42 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

5 6. It creates a subtraction modification for an amount equal to 50% of the 
6 apportionable global low-taxed intangible income included in federal gross income, 
7 pursuant to the Code, Section 951A, by the taxpayer. This provision applies to tax years 
8 beginning on or after January 1, 2018. 
9 Part E expands the corporate income tax brackets beginning in 2018. The current rate 
10 structure for taxable corporations consists of 3.5% on income not over $25,000, 7.93% on 
11 income not over $75,000, 8.33% on income not over $250,000 and 8.93% on income of 
12 $250,000 or more. The rate structure for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 
13 consists of 3.5% on income not over $350,000, 7.93% on income not over $1,050,000, 
14 8.33% on income not over $3,500,000 and 8.93% on income of $3,500,000 or more. 
15 Part F amends the Maine College Savings Program to change the name to the Maine 
16 Education Savings Program and, as a result of recent federal changes to the Internal 
17 Revenue Code, Section 529, qualified tuition programs, extends the ability to use the 
18 program for enrollment or attendance expenses at an elementary or secondary public, 
19 private or religious school and to receive favorable federal tax treatment on the earnings 
20 portions of such disbursements. Part F provides for changes to the Maine Revised 
21 Statutes to reflect the change to the name of the program. Part F also conforms the 
22 program's state tax treatment of such disbursements to federal law. 
23 Part G retains the Maine exclusion amount under the estate tax at the amount in effect 
24 for deaths prior to January 1, 2018, subject to an annual inflation adjustment, and does 
25 not conform to the increases in the federal basic exclusion amount. 
26 Part H provides a credit under the income tax and the insurance premium tax equal to
