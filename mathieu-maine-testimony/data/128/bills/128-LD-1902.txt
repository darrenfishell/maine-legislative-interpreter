10 Disabilities Education Act funds.  The additional allocation under  this paragraph is 
11 limited by a statewide average  per-pupil special  education under-allocation rate 
12 calculated as  follows:
13 (1)  First, for each school administrative unit, the difference  between the EPS 
14 special education allocation, not including  any funds received under  this 
15 paragraph, and that school administrative  unit's most recent adjusted special 
16 education expenditures must  be calculated;

18 school administrative units must be calculated; and
19 (3)  Third, the sum arrived  at under subparagraph (2) must be divided by the 
20 statewide special education  child count to arrive  at the statewide average per-
21 pupil special education  under-allocation rate.
22 The statewide average  per-pupil special education under-allocation rate must be

27 expenditures, divided  by the school administrative  unit's special education child  count  
28 results in a per-pupil amount that is greater than the statewide  average per-pupil 
29 special education under-allocation  rate, then the additional allocation under this 
30 paragraph is limited to the statewide  average per-pupil special education under-
31 allocation rate times  the school administrative  unit's special education child count.  If 
32 the difference between a school  administrative  unit's  EPS special  education

35 the school  administrative unit's special  education child count results in a per-pupil  
36 amount that is equal to or less than the statewide  average per-pupil special  education 
37 under-allocation rate, that unit's additional allocation under this paragraph is the 
38 amount of the difference between the school administrative unit's EPS special  
39 education allocation, not including any funds received under  this paragraph, and the 
40 school administrative unit's most  recent  adjusted  special education expenditures; and
41 Sec. 6.  Collaboration  between general  education and special education.

35 districts and how to reduce those costs.  The Maine  Education Policy Research Institute  
36 shall gather  additional information on what is driving special education  litigation  and on

39 costs while still providing special education services  that meet  the needs  of the students.  
40 Should the research project be included in the cooperative project agreement approved for 
41 fiscal year 2018-19, the Maine Education Policy Research Institute shall report  the 
Page 7 - 128LR2942(01)-11 findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
