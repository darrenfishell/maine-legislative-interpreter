amended to read:  3 
1.  Associated facilities.  "Associated facilities" means elements of a wind energy 4 
development ot her than its generating facilities that are necessary to the proper operation 5 
and maintenance of the wind energy development, including but not limited to buildings, 6 
access roads, generator lead lines and substations.  "Associated facilities" does not 7 
include utility -owned facilities.  8 
Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§§5 and 6, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. 9 
A, §7, are amended to read:  10 
5.  Generating facilities.  "Generating facilities" means wind turbines and towers and 11 
transmission lines, not including g enerator lead lines, that are immediately associated 12 
with the wind turbines.  "Generating facilities" does not include utility -owned facilities.  13 
6.  Grid -scale wind energy development.  "Grid -scale wind energy development" 14 
means a wind energy development t hat is of a size that would qualify as a development of 15 
state or regional significance that may substantially affect the environment as defined 16 
under Title 38, section 482, subsection 2, paragraph A or paragraph C.  "Grid -scale wind 17 
energy development" doe s not include utility -owned facilities.  18 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§10-C is enacted to read:  19 
10-C.  Utility -owned facilities.   "Utility -owned facilities" means facilities that are 20 
owned and operated by a transmission and distribution utility and that ar e necessary for 21 
the interconnection of a wind energy development to the electric grid, including but not 22 
limited to substations, switchyards, transmission lines and associated corridors and other 23 
voltage control and reactive power control devices.  24 
Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§11, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 25 
amended to read:  26 
11.  Wind energy development.  "Wind energy development" means a development 27 
that uses a windmill or wind turbine to convert wind energy to electrical energy for sale 28 
or use by a person other than the generator.  A wind energy development includes 29 
generating facilities and associated facilities , but does not include utility -owned facilities . 30 
Sec. 5.  38 MRSA §482, sub -§8, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. E, §16, is 31 
amended to read:  32 
8.  Offshore wind power project.  "Offshore wind power project" means a project 33 
that uses a windmill or wind turbine to convert wind energy to electrical energy and is 34 
located in whole or in part within coastal wetlands as defined in section  480-B, 35 
subsection 2.  "Offshore wind power project" includes both generating facilities as 36 
defined by Title 35 -A, section 3451, subsection 5 and associated facilities as defined by 37 
Title 35 -A, section 3451, subsection 1, without regard to whether the elec trical energy is 38

 for sale or use by a person other than the generator.  "Offshore wind power project" does 1 
not include utility -owned facilities as defined in Title 35 -A, section 3451, subsection 2 
10-C. 3 
SUMMARY  4 
This bill specifies that associated facilities constructed for wind energy development 5 
do not include utility -owned facilities and utility -owned facilities are not part of a wind 6 
energy development or offshore wind power project.  7
