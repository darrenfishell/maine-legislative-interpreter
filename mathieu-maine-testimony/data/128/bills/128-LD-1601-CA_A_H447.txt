Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Under current law, a $20 annual surcharge is assessed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
(ACF) on each product name of commercial feed that is pet food or that is pet food from a home-based manufacturer. 
The first $100,000 collected is credited to the Companion Animal Sterilization Fund (CASF) and anything over 
$100,000 is credited to the Animal Welfare Fund (AWF). This bill continues the $20 annual surcharge, but changes 
the distribution by crediting any amounts over $157,000 to the CASF, instead ofto the A WF. Any amounts below 
$157,000 would be distributed the same way as under current statute. This will increase revenue to the CASF and 
decrease revenue by the same amount to the A WF in any years when the total exceeds $157,000. ACF may need to 
adjust allocations to the two funds to acco1mnodate amounts collected in the future.
