Page 1 - 128LR2542(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA c.  223, sub-c. 11 is enacted  to read:
3 SUBCHAPTER 11
4 FOOD RIGHTS
5 ยง6681.  Access to food and use of food discipline
6 This section governs  student access  to and school  use of food, including as a 
7 disciplinary tool, in public schools.
8 1.  Serving of reimbursable meals.  A public school that provides free and reduced-
9 price meals  or other meals  to students pursuant  to subchapter 7 or otherwise provides to 
10 students meals eligible for reimbursement  under a program administered by the United 
11 States Department  of Agriculture shall  provide such a meal  to a student who requests  the 
12 meal and is otherwise  eligible for the meal regardless of the student's inability to pay for 
13 the school meal or failure in the past to pay for school meals.  The principal,  assistant  
14 principal or guidance counselor of the public school shall  contact the parent  or guardian 
15 of a student who requests a meal  in accordance with this subsection to offer  the parent or 
16 guardian assistance with any necessary applications.  The principal,  assistant  principal  or 
17 guidance counselor may also inquire of the parent  or guardian if there are other  issues 
18 within the student's household that have caused the student to have insufficient funds to 
19 purchase school meals and  may offer  other  assistance.
20 2.  Punishment related to meals.  A  public  school may not:
21 A.  Because of a student's inability  to pay for a meal or because of any payments due 
22 for meals served previously  to the  student,  require the  student:
23 (1)  To throw away a  meal  after it has been served to the  student; or
24 (2)  To undertake chores or work as a means of paying  for one or more meals or 
25 as punishment  for not paying for one  or more  meals; or
26 B.  Refuse a meal to a  student as a form of or as  part of a disciplinary action.
27 3.  Stigmatization.  A public school  may not openly  identify or otherwise  stigmatize 
28 a student who cannot pay for a meal or who has payments due for previous meals by 
29 requiring the student to wear a wristband, hand stamp  or other identifying  mark or sign 
30 noticeable by others.
31 4.  Required communications.  A public school's communications about  a student's 
32 meal debts  must be made to the parent  or guardian of the student rather than to the 
33 student directly.   A public  school may ask a student to carry to the student's  parent or 
34 guardian a letter  regarding  the student's  meal debt.
Page 2 - 128LR2542(01)-11 SUMMARY
2 This bill does the following.
3 1.  It requires  a public school that provides free and reduced-price  meals  or other  
4 meals to students  pursuant  to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A,  chapter 223, 
5 subchapter 7 or otherwise provides to students meals eligible for reimbursement under  a 
6 program administered  by the United States  Department  of Agriculture to provide such a 
7 meal to a student who requests the meal and is otherwise eligible for the meal  regardless 
8 of the student's inability  to pay for the school meal  or failure  in the past to pay for school 
9 meals. It also requires  the school  to take certain actions to assist the parent or guardian of 
10 a student  who requests  such  a meal.
11 2.  It prohibits  a public  school from punishing  a student in certain ways  solely  
12 because of the student's inability  to pay for a meal  or because of any payments  due for 
13 previous meals.  It also prohibits a public school  from refusing a meal to a student  as a 
14 form of  or as part of a  disciplinary  action.
15 3.  It prohibits a public school from  openly identifying or stigmatizing  a student who 
16 cannot pay for a meal or who has payments due for previous meals by requiring the 
17 student to wear a wristband,  hand stamp  or other identifying mark or sign noticeable by 
18 others.
19 4.  It requires  a public school to communicate about a student's meal  debts directly  to 
20 the parent  or guardian of the student  rather  than to the student.  A public school  may ask a 
21 student to carry  to the student's parent  or guardian  a letter  regarding a  student's meal  debt.
