SUMMARY  26 
Current law  requires that a Class A restaurant, Class A lounge, Class A 27 
restaurant/lounge, club licensed to sell liquor,  hotel or bed and breakfast that wishes to 28 
acquire an off -premises catering license from the State also receive approval from the 29 
municipality in which the event is to occur, and a municipality may set its own fee for 30 
granting a permit.  This bill eliminates the requirement that an applicant for an off - 31 
premises catering license from the State receive approval from the municipality.  32
