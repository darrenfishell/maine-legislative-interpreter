3.  Review of forest management and harvest plan by Bur eau of Forestry.   The 8 
Director of the Bureau of Forestry within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 9 
and Forestry is authorized to review the forest management and harvest plan of any parcel 10 
enrolled under this subchapter for which there is no appar ent evidence of timber 11 
harvesting on a reasonably sized portion of the parcel within the previous 20 years to 12 
determine whether the plan complies with this subchapter and whether the landowner is 13 
making a reasonable effort to manage the parcel according to  the schedules and 14 
recommendations in that plan.  15 
A.  Consistent with the findings of the Tree Growth Tax Law Audit report from the 16 
bureau to the Committee on Taxation dated February 28, 2014, the director may limit 17 
reviews under this subsection to island, coastal and waterfront parcels where there is 18 
a large difference between the valuation under this subchapter and just value.  19 
B.  For the purposes of this subsection, the director must consider at least the 20 
following factors in determining whether the plan is in compliance:  21 
(1)  Evidence of significant tree mortality and forest stand deterioration;  22 
(2)  Evidence of timber harvesting on a reasonably sized portion of the parcel 23 
within the previous 20 years; and  24 
(3)  Whether the plan recommends management activ ities within a reasonable 25 
time period based on visible evidence.  26 
C.  For the purposes of this subsection, the Director of the Bureau of Forestry or the 27 
director's designee may:  28 
(1)  With appropriate notification to the landowner, enter and examine forest l and 29 
for the purpose of determining compliance with the forest management and 30 
harvest plan pursuant to section 574 -B; 31 
(2)  Request and review a forest management and harvest plan required under 32 
section 574 -B, which must be provided by a landowner or the lan downer's agent 33 
upon request; and  34 
(3)  Request and review an expired forest management and harvest plan, which 35 
must be provided by a landowner or the landowner's agent upon request.  36 
D.  If the Bureau of Forestry determines that a landowner is not in substan tial 37 
compliance with this subchapter or that a parcel is not being managed in substantial 38 
compliance with a plan developed under subsection 1, the Bureau of Forestry shall 39 
provide notice of its determination to that landowner and notice that the landowner 40 
has 90 days to come into substantial compliance with this subchapter and one year to 41 
 
 Page 3 - 128L R2328(01) -1 
 bring the parcel into substantial compliance with the plan. If the landowner fails to 1 
come into substantial compliance by the end of the 90 -day period or fails to bring th e 2 
parcel into substantial compliance with the plan by the end of the one -year period, the 3 
Bureau of Forestry shall report the noncompliance to the assessor for that parcel who, 4 
pursuant to section 581, shall withdraw the land from taxation under this subch apter.  5 
E.  A landowner whose land is withdrawn from taxation under this subchapter 6 
pursuant to paragraph D may apply to reclassify the parcel as open space land; that 7 
application may not unreasonably be denied.  8 
A forest management and harvest plan provided  to the Director of the Bureau of Forestry 9 
or the director's designee under this subsection is confidential. Information collected 10 
pursuant to this subsection is confidential and is not a public record as defined in Title 1, 11 
section 402, subsection 3, exce pt that the director may publish at least one summary 12 
report annually, which may not reveal the activities of any person and which must be 13 
available as a public record.  14 
This subsection is repealed January 1, 2020.  15 
Sec. 7.  36 MRSA §578, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 404, §1, is further 16 
amended to read:  17 
1.  Organized areas.   The municipal assessors or chief assessor of a primary 18 
assessing area shall adjust the State Tax Assessor's 100% valuation per acre for each 19 
forest type of their county by whatever r atio, or percentage of current just value, is 20 
applied to other property within the municipality to obtain the assessed values.  Forest 21 
land in the organized areas, subject to taxation under this subchapter, must be taxed at the 22 
property tax rate applicable  to other property in the municipality.  23 
The State Tax Assessor shall determine annually the amount of acreage in each 24 
municipality that is classified and taxed in accordance with this subchapter.  Each 25 
municipality is entitled to annual payments distribute d in accordance with this section 26 
from money appropriated by the Legislature if it submits an annual return in accordance 27 
with section 383 and if it achieves the minimum assessment ratio established in section 28 
327.  The State Tax Assessor shall pay any mun icipal claim found to be in satisfactory 29 
form by August 1st of the year following the submission of the annual return.  The 30 
municipal reimbursement appropriation is calculated on the basis of 90% of the per acre 31 
tax revenue lost as a result of this subchap ter.  For property tax years based on the status 32 
of property on April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2009, municipal reimbursement under this 33 
section is further limited to the amount appropriated by the Legislature and distributed on 34 
a pro rata basis by the State Ta x Assessor for all timely filed claims.  For purposes of this 35 
section, "classified forest lands" means forest lands classified pursuant to this subchapter 36 
as well as all areas identified as forested land within farmland parcels that are transferred 37 
from tr ee growth classification pursuant to section 1112 on or after October 1, 2011. For 38 
the purposes of this section, the tax lost is the tax that would have been assessed, but for 39 
this subchapter, on the classified forest lands if they were assessed according to the 40 
undeveloped acreage valuations used in the state valuation then in effect, or according to 41 
the current local valuation on undeveloped acreage, whichever is less, minus the tax that 42 
was actually assessed on the same lands in accordance with this subc hapter, and adjusted 43 
for the aggregate municipal savings in required educational costs attributable to reduced 44 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR2328(01) -1 
 state valuation.  A municipality that fails to achieve the minimum assessment ratio 1 
established in section 327 loses 10% of the reimbursement pro vided by this section for 2 
each one percentage point the minimum assessment ratio falls below the ratio established 3 
in section 327.  The State Tax Assessor may not make payment pursuant to this 4 
subchapter to a municipality in the year following notification  by the Department of 5 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Forestry that the municipality has 6 
failed to remove a parcel from enrollment under this subchapter pursuant to the 7 
requirements under section 575 -A, subsection 3.  8 
The State Tax Assesso r shall adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of this 9 
section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules for the 10 
purposes of Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 11 
C.  The State Tax Assessor shall distribute reimburs ement under this section to each 12 
municipality in proportion to the product of the reduced tree growth valuation of the 13 
municipality multiplied by the property tax burden of the municipality.  For purposes 14 
of this paragraph, unless the context otherwise ind icates, the following terms have the 15 
following meanings.  16 
(1)  "Property tax burden" means the total real and personal property taxes 17 
assessed in the most recently completed municipal fiscal year, except the taxes 18 
assessed on captured value within a tax inc rement financing district, divided by 19 
the latest state valuation certified to the Secretary of State.  20 
(2)  "Undeveloped land" means rear acreage and unimproved nonwaterfront 21 
acreage that is not:  22 
(a)  Classified under the laws governing current use valuatio n set forth in 23 
chapter 105, subchapter 2 -A, 10 or 10 -A; 24 
(b)  A base lot; or  25 
(c)  Waste land  Wasteland . 26 
(3)  "Average value of undeveloped land" means the per acre undeveloped land 27 
valuations used in the state valuation then in effect, or according to the c urrent 28 
local valuation on undeveloped land as determined for state valuation purposes, 29 
whichever is less.  30 
(4)  "Reduced tree growth valuation" means the difference between the average 31 
value of undeveloped land and the average value of tree growth land time s the 32 
total number of acres classified as forest land under this subchapter plus the total 33 
number of acres of forest land that is transferred from tree growth classification 34 
to farmland classification pursuant to section 1112 on or after October 1, 2011.  35 
Sec. 8.  36 MRSA §581, sub -§2-A is enacted to read:  36 
2-A.  Parcels smaller than 25 acres.  A landowner of a parcel of land smaller than 37 
25 acres that was taxed pursuant to this subchapter for a property tax year beginning 38 
before April 1, 2018 may:  39

B.  Apply for classification of that parcel pursuant to section 1106 -A; or  41 
 
 Page 5 - 128L R2328(01) -1 
 C.  Notwithstanding subsection 3, withdraw that parcel from tree growth 1 
classification under this subchapter for the 2018 tax year . A landowner who elects to 2 
withdraw the parcel pursuant to this paragraph shall:  3

classification under this subchapter for the 2018 tax year;  5 
(2)  Notify the assessor for th at parcel before April 1, 2018 of the intent to 6 
withdraw the parcel; and  7 
(3)  Pay a penalty equal to the taxes that would have been assessed on the first 8 
day of April for the 5 tax years, or the number of tax years starting with the year 9 
in which the prope rty was first classified, whichever is less, preceding the 10 
withdrawal had that parcel been assessed in each of those years at its fair market 11 
value on the date of withdrawal, less all taxes paid on that parcel over the 12 
preceding 5 years or the number of ta x years starting with the year in which the 13 
property was first classified, whichever is less, and interest at the rate established 14 
pursuant to section 186 from the date or dates on which those amounts would 15 
have been payable.  16

§16, is amended to read:  18

assessed upon the withdrawal of land from taxation under this subchapter if the owner 20 
applies for classificati on of that land as farmland or open space land under subchapter 10 21 
and that application is accepted. An assessor may not unreasonably deny an application 22 
for reclassification.   If a penalty is later assessed under section 1112, the period of time 23 
that the land was taxed as forest land under this subchapter is included for purposes of 24 
establishing the amount of the penalty.  25 
Sec. 10.  36 MRSA §581 -A, as amended by PL 2001, c. 305, §1 and affected by 26
