This amendment changes the funding source for the General Fund appropriations included in the Committee 
Amendment A in fiscal year 2017-18. The purpose of the funding remains the same. 
The amendment removes the $875,000 General fund appropriation in fiscal year 2017-18 that was in Committee 
Amendment A and adds an $875,000 Other Special Revenue Funds allocation to the newly created Veterans Mental 
Health and Case Management Services Fund in the same year. Funding for the allocation will come from a transfer of 
$875,000 from the General Fund unappropriated surplus to the new fund in fiscal year 2016-17. Funding for the 
General Fund transfer will come from 2 deappropriations in fiscal year 2016-17, one deappropriation of $375,000 
from the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management and one deappropriation of $500,000 from 
the Department of Health and Human Services.
