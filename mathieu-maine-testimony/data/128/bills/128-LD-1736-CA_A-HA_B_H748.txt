This amendment removes from the bill the $400,000 transfer from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund and the related 
Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management. 
Instead, it includes a General Fund appropriation of $400,000 to the department beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 for 
financial assistance and tuition assistance to veterans. Any future reduction to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund is 
eliminated with this change.
