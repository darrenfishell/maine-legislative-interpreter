SUMMARY  22 
This bill establishes an industrial hemp pilot program under which education al 23 
institutions of higher learning and others are allowed to plant, grow, harvest, process, 24 
possess, transport, purchase, sell and distribute industrial hemp for research purposes 25 
under a license issued by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Fo restry.  The 26 
department is required to adopt rules to certify and register sites and license activities 27 
related to industrial hemp and to license industrial hemp producer collectives.  The rules 28 
must address testing procedures and standards, an industrial hemp certified seed program, 29 
pollen drift and feral hemp and allow for hemp production indoors, outdoors and in 30 
greenhouses.  31 
This bill allows licensees to use industrial hemp clones.  It requires the department to 32 
encourage collaboration with other states'  educational institutions of higher learning and 33 
state departments of agriculture.  It also prevents industrial hemp from being listed as a 34 
primary or secondary noxious -weed seed.  It creates a civil violation for a person or entity 35 
that violates the new p rovision.  36
