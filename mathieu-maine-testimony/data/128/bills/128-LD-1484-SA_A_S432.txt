Contingent future biennium savings -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment eliminates the language in the bill that would have allowed Atkinson, and all townships that 
deorganize on or after July 1, 2019, to contribute to the cost of education under the same state/local funding 
provisions as "organized" towns and municipalities. 
As amended, the deorganization of the Town of Atkinson will lower the total cost ofK-12 public education beginning 
in fiscal year 2019-20 and result in savings to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program within the 
Department of Education. The amount of savings can not be determined at this time. For comparison purposes, the 
preliminary total cost allocation for Atkinson for the 2018-2019 school year is $327,693 with the State contributing 
$172, 000 of that total. 
As amended, the Division of State Schools -Education in the Unorganized Territories program in the Department of 
Education will incur future General Fund expenditures to provide services to the Unorganized Territories. These 
expenditures would be ongoing and would be to provide schooling to students from Atkinson. The cost can not be 
determined at this time, but is estimated to be approximately $327,693 annually. The General Fund would be fully 
reimbursed for these costs by higher collections made through the Municipal Cost Component program.
