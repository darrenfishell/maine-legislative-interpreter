17 company confirming that the firm has the financial capacity to perform  the work before  
18 furnishing that person  with plans and specifications for the proposed  public work  
19 advertised.
20 The Director of General  Services  Chief Facilities Officer , after consultation  with the 
21 appropriate department head or superintendent of schools, may refuse to release plans  and 
22 specifications to  a contractor for the purpose  of bidding on a  project:
23 1.  Untimely completion.  If, in the opinion of the director Chief Facilities Officer, 
24 there is evidence  the contractor has not completed in a timely manner a prior construction  
25 project or projects  and the resulting  noncompletion clearly reflects disregard for the 
26 completion date and has created a  hardship for the owner;

28 is evidence  the contractor has a history of inability to complete  similar work;
29 3.  Insufficient  resources.   If, in the opinion of the director Chief Facilities Officer,

4 evidence of a history of inadequate safety performance and lack of formal  safety  
5 procedures;
6 6.  Material misrepresentation.  If, in the opinion of the director Chief  Facilities  
7 Officer,  there  is evidence of a material  misrepresentation  on the contractor's prebid 
8 qualification statement;  or
9 7.  Termination, suspension,  defaults.  If, in the opinion  of the director Chief  
10 Facilities Officer, there is evidence that the contractor  through its own fault has been  
11 terminated, has been suspended for cause, has been debarred from  bidding, has agreed to 
12 refrain from bidding as part of a settlement  or has defaulted on a contract or had a 
13 contract completed by another  party.
14 If a contractor  is disqualified for any of the reasons stated in subsection 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 
15 7, the director Chief  Facilities Officer may disallow the contractor from  bidding on any 
16 similar public  improvements  for a period not to exceed one  year.

24 has refused  to accept  the contractor's bid.  The appeal  process must be conducted at the 
25 discretion of the commissioner, but must  be completed and a final decision  rendered

31 health and retirement benefits to its employees.  The State Purchasing Agent  Chief  
32 Procurement Officer shall adopt rules governing the purchase of services and the 
33 awarding of grants or contracts  for personal services  to establish  a basis for bid price  and 
34 cost comparison among  businesses  that provide health and retirement benefits to their 
35 employees and those  that do not provide  these benefits.  The rules must include a 
36 methodology for calculating bid price and cost differentials for services provided  by 
37 businesses and state employees  due to the provision of health and retirement benefits for 
38 employees.  The rules  must adjust the bid prices to establish an equivalent basis for bid 
39 price and cost comparison among businesses  when awarding contracts or grants  and 
40 between businesses and state employees when determining whether or not a contract or 
41 grant is permitted  under  section 1816-A.  These rules  must  apply to all state departments

25 "Maine is a state that believes employers should  fairly compensate hard work, that 
26 the health and safety of working people should be protected and that no form of 
27 unlawful discrimination  or abuse should  be tolerated.  Maine citizens  are aware that 
28 laws and regulations  designed to safeguard basic  tenets  of ethical business  practice 
29 are disregarded in many  workplaces, commonly referred to as "sweatshops."  State  
30 Government purchase of goods made under  abusive conditions  on behalf of its 
31 citizens offends Maine  citizens' sense of justice and decency.  Moreover, when  the 
32 State of Maine contracts with vendors whose suppliers profit  by providing 
33 substandard wages and working conditions, Maine's businesses are put at a 
34 competitive disadvantage.   Therefore, the State of Maine believes in doing business 
35 with vendors who make a good  faith effort to ensure that they and their suppliers at 
36 the point of assembly adhere  to the principles of the State of Maine's purchasing code  
37 of conduct.
38 "In its role as a market participant that procures goods  covered by this code,  the State 
39 of Maine seeks to protect the interests of Maine  citizens  and businesses by exercising 
40 its state sovereignty to spend Maine citizens' tax dollars in a manner consistent with 
41 their expressed wishes that the State deal with responsible bidders who seek contracts 
42 to supply  goods to the State of Maine,  and protect legally compliant  Maine 
Page 43 - 128LR2768(01)-11 businesses and workers from unfair competition  created by downward pressure  on 
2 prices and conditions attributable to businesses that violate applicable  workplace 
3 laws.
4 "Seeking to protect these  local interests through  the least discriminatory means  
5 available, the State of Maine requires that all bidders  seeking contracts to supply the 
6 State of Maine with goods covered by this code sign an affidavit stating that they and, 
7 to the best of their knowledge, their suppliers at the point  of assembly  comply with 
8 workplace laws of the vendor's or supplier's site of assembly and with treaty 
9 obligations that are shared by the United States and the country in which the goods 
10 are assembled."

28 The State Purchasing Agent Chief Procurement Officer shall adopt rules under this 
29 subchapter governing the award  of bids.  Those  rules  must  include specific guidelines  for

Page 46 - 128LR2768(01)-11 bargaining position with an offending supplier to change the supplier's practices, the State  
2 Purchasing Agent Chief Procurement Officer  may take appropriate remedial action 
3 including, but not limited to, barring the subject contractor from bidding on future  state 
4 contracts or terminating  the State's  contract with the contractor.   Reference to the

27 to buffer ratepayers  in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 
28 development.  To the greatest extent possible,  the commission  shall  develop procedures 
29 for long-term contracts for investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities under 
30 this subsection having  the same legal and financial effect as the procedures used for 
31 standard-offer  service pursuant to section 3212 for investor- owned transmission and 
32 distribution utilities.
33 The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible, demand  response or energy 
34 efficiency capacity resources.  These contracts are not subject to the rules  of the State 
35 Purchasing Agent  Chief  Procurement Officer.  In a competitive solicitation conducted 
36 pursuant to subsection 6, the commission shall  allow transmission and distribution 
37 utilities to submit bids  for interruptible  or demand response capacity resources.
38 Capacity resources  contracted under this subsection  may not exceed the amount 
39 necessary to ensure the reliability  of the electric grid of this State, to meet  the energy  
40 efficiency program budget  allocations articulated  in the triennial plan as approved by the

3 Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a capacity  
4 resource may not be contracted  under this subsection unless  the commission determines 
5 that the capacity resource  is recognized as a capacity resource for purposes  of any 
6 regional or  federal  capacity requirements.

23 or savings for the previous year associated with any procurement, the total ratepayer costs 
24 or savings at the time of the report and the megawatt-hours, renewable  energy credits  or 
25 capacity produced  or procured through  contracts. The report must also include  a plan for 
26 the succeeding 12 months  pertaining to the procurement of capacity resources, energy  
27 and renewable energy  credits,  including  dates for requests for proposals,  and types of 
28 resources to be procured.
29 Sec. 148.  35-A MRSA §3212, sub-§2, as amended by PL 1999, c. 577, §4 and c. 
30 578, §1, is  further amended to read:
31 2.  Selection of standard-offer service providers.  After terms and conditions for 
32 standard-offer service have been established under subsection 1, the commission shall 
33 administer a bid process  to select a standard-offer service  provider  for that transmission 
34 and distribution utility's service territory.  By December 1, 1999, the commission shall 
35 review the bid submissions for each transmission and distribution  utility and select the 
36 standard-offer service provider or providers  for that utility's  service territory.
37 A.  The commission  shall  determine the general credit data and specific information  
38 from general load and usage data that transmission and distribution  utilities must 
39 provide to potential standard-offer service bidders, including, but not limited to, 
40 monthly demand and energy consumption and the number of customers in each 
41 customer class.  The commission shall ensure  that individual customer  confidentiality 
42 is preserved  in this process and that a transmission and distribution utility releases 
43 customer-specific data only with the customer's  permission.  If the transmission and 
44 distribution utility incurs  additional  costs to develop and produce the required data,  
Page 62 - 128LR2768(01)-11 the commission shall  permit that utility to recover  those costs through  transmission 
2 and distribution  rates.
3 B.  The commission  shall establish the maximum duration of a standard-offer  service 
4 contract after considering all relevant  factors,  including,  but not limited  to, market 
5 risks and  the need for price stability and contract flexibility.
6 C.  A competitive electricity  provider that is an affiliate of a large investor-owned  
7 transmission and distribution  utility  may submit bids to provide  standard-offer 
8 service for up to 20% of the electric  load within the service territory of the large 
9 investor-owned transmission and distribution  utility  with which  it is affiliated.  To 
10 prevent the unfair  use of information possessed by a large investor-owned 
11 transmission and distribution utility, the commission shall  ensure  that a utility 
12 seeking to bid on standard-offer service has no greater  access to relevant information 
13 than is provided to other  potential bidders.
14 D.  A consumer-owned transmission and distribution  utility and a small investor-
15 owned transmission  and distribution utility may submit bids to provide standard-offer  
16 service for that utility's service territory.  To prevent the unfair use of information  
17 possessed by a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility or a small 
18 investor-owned transmission and distribution  utility,  the commission shall  ensure that 
19 a utility seeking  to bid on standard-offer service has no greater access to relevant 
20 information than is provided to other potential bidders.
21 The commission shall adopt rules establishing a methodology for structuring the bidding 
22 process for standard-offer service in order to implement the provisions of this subsection.  
23 In adopting rules, the commission  shall  consider methods to ensure,  to the extent 
24 possible, at least 3 providers of standard-offer service in each transmission and 
25 distribution utility service territory, as long as the method does not result in any 
26 significant adverse impacts  on rates paid by consumers.  Rules adopted under this 
27 subsection are routine  technical rules pursuant to Title  5, chapter 375, subchapter II-A 
28 2-A.
29 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the commission  may, in the event  of a 
30 default by a standard-offer service  provider, require  the transmission and distribution 
31 utility in whose service territory the provider was providing  standard-offer service to 
32 arrange and to provide  for default service.   Notwithstanding  any other provision of this 
33 Title, the commission may, in the event  that the commission receives  no bids to provide 
34 standard-offer service  in a transmission and distribution utility's territory or the 
35 commission determines that the bids it receives are inadequate or unacceptable, require  
36 the transmission and distribution utility to arrange  and to provide  for default service.  
37 Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Title, the commission may require a 
38 transmission and distribution  utility to provide  default service to its customers that are not 
39 located within either the New  England  independent  system operator control  area or the 
40 Maritimes control area; and this default  service pursuant to this sentence must be 
41 provided to customers at the same price  and on the same terms and conditions as 
42 standard-offer service is provided to the customers  of the transmission and distribution 
43 utility in the standard-offer  class in which  the customer is eligible  to receive service.  The 
44 arrangement and provision of such this default  service by a transmission and distribution
