JOINT RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT MAINE'S MAPLE SYRUP AND HONEY
 PRODUCERS
 
            WHEREAS, Maine is known for its natural and wholesome foods and is the 3rd largest
 producer of maple syrup in the United States, producing over $20,000,000 of maple syrup in 2017,
 and produces over $2,000,000 of honey annually; and 
            WHEREAS, the pure honey and maple syrup industries have worked diligently to educate
 consumers about the value and purity of their products as a result of the introduction of similarly identified but inferior products into the marketplace; and
 
            WHEREAS, product labels that clearly describe the contents of containers at the point of sale are the most direct message available to consumers; and
 
            WHEREAS, the United States Food and Drug Administration has released a proposed rule that would require that honey and maple syrup be labeled as containing "added sugar" even when
 these products are 100% pure single-ingredient products; and
             WHEREAS, the inclusion of the "added sugar" declaration to single-ingredient products like
 honey and maple syrup, to which no sugar has been added, will result in consumer confusion and
 may erode consumer confidence; and 
            WHEREAS, a requirement to declare "added sugar" would compromise the integrity of
 naturally sweet single-ingredient products and would have an irrevocably negative impact on the Maine maple syrup and honey industries; now, therefore, be it
 
            RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature now assembled in the Second Special Session, on behalf of the people we represent, take this
 opportunity to support the United States Food and Drug Administration's efforts at clear labeling to
 support the consumer's ability to make informed purchasing decisions but recommend that the
 United States Food and Drug Administration exempt pure maple syrup and honey from its proposed
 rule; and be it further
             RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary of
 State, be transmitted to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and to all members of
 the Maine Congressional Delegation.
