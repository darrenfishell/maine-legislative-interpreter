3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment is a minority report of the committee. The amendment strikes the 
5 bill's proposal to raise the required percentage of a retired teacher's share of the premium 
6 for group accident and sickness or health insurance from 45% to 60% between fiscal year 
7 2016-17 and fiscal year 2020-21. The amendment retains the current requirement that the 
8 State pay 45% of a retired teacher's share of the premium for group accident and sickness 
9 or health insurance and, beginning in fiscal year 2017-18, removes the restriction in 
10 current law that limits the increase in the State's total cost for retired teachers' health 
11 insurance premiums.
