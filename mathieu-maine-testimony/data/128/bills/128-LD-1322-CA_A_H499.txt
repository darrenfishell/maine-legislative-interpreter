The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $30,265 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of 
Public Safety to provide 8 hours of mental health first aid training as part of basic corrections training. Other Special 
Revenue Funds revenue to the Department of Public Safety would increase by $39,504 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 
training fees charged. 
The cost to provide mental health first aid training to state correctional staff is expected to be a significant General 
Fund cost. The Department of Corrections has estimated overtime costs of $420,000 and course, travel, meals and 
lodging costs in excess of $100,000 to move more than 700 employees through 8 hours of training. Due to uncertainty 
over the number of staff trained annually and the number of overtime hours required, the cost to the Department of 
Corrections by fiscal year is not estimated at this time.
