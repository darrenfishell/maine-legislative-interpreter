The amendment eliminates the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$67,661 in fiscal year 2017-18 and reduces the appropriation by $22,578 in fiscal year 2018-19 due to the delay of the 
start date for chiropractic evaluation and management examinations to be reimbursed under the MaineCare program 
until October 1, 2018. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also reduced for the FMAP match.
