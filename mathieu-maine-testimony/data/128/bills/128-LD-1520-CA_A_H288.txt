This bill will create an aquaculture license to be issued by the Department of Marine Resources (DMR). Under 
current statute the holder of an aquaculture lease must purchase a commercial shellfish license with a fee of $133, 
with $74.75 credited to the Shellfish Management Fund (SMF) and $58.25 credited to General Fund revenue. This bill 
creates an aquaculture license with the same fee of $133, with all revenue going to the previously established 
Aquaculture Management Fund (AMF). DMR estimates that approximately 100 commercial shellfish license holders 
will purchase the new aquaculture license instead of a commercial shellfish license. These changes are estimated to 
reduce General Fund revenue by $5,825, reduce SMF revenue by $7,475 and increase AMF revenue by $13,300 
annually beginning in fiscal year 2017-18.
