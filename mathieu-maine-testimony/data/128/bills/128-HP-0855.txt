JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAINE 'S CREDIT UNIONS 
 
 WHEREAS,  Maine's credit unions are member-owned and member-o perated financial 
cooperatives with an unwavering commitment to servi ng the needs of their members and 
communities.  The nonprofit structure of credit uni ons provides each member with an equal 
voice and representation in the operations of the c redit union.  Serving members in all 16 Maine 
counties and in every community, Maine's credit uni ons are focused on the needs of their 
member owners with the primary purpose of benefitin g the more than 685,000 Maine consumers 
who use credit unions; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the economic benefit that Maine's credit unions pro vide to Maine consumers 
is approximately $45,000,000 annually, as a result of lower and fewer fees on products and 
services, lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on savings; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  Maine is ranked as the nation's 5th strongest credi t union state based on the 
percentage of population that uses a credit union, a position Maine has held for 14 consecutive 
years, and credit unions serve more than half the r esidents of the State; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the 2,250 full-time and part-time employees of Main e's credit unions and 
the more than 1,000 unpaid volunteers who serve on credit union boards and committees 
demonstrate the core credit union values, philosoph y and mission of people helping people by 
contributing to the communities they serve, not jus t with financial services but by fostering a 
spirit that strengthens communities; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  since 1990 Maine's credit unions and their members have raised $7,200,000 
to help end hunger in Maine, including a record-set ting $674,193 in 2016.  One hundred percent 
of all money that is raised through the Maine Credi t Unions' Campaign for Ending Hunger stays 
in Maine and goes directly to assist thousands of M aine families and individuals who otherwise 
would go hungry.  In addition to contributing thous ands of dollars to food pantries in 
communities across the State, Maine's credit unions  also help to provide funds for statewide 
initiatives to help end hunger, such as being the p rimary source of funding for the State's first 
Food Mobile, which has delivered more than 5,200,00 0 pounds of food to food pantries in every 
Maine county since 2005; and

 WHEREAS,  in partnership with the Good Shepherd Food Bank, Ma ine's credit unions, as 
major supporters of the BackPack Program and the Sc hool Pantry Program, have demonstrated a 
renewed commitment to ending childhood hunger.  The  support of Maine's credit unions has 
helped these programs to grow to serve more than 12 0 schools and more than 3,500 students

hungry; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  in 2016 Maine's credit unions contributed more than  $1,700,000 to a variety 
of causes and organizations, including financial li teracy programs such as Youth Financial 
Fitness Fairs, which were delivered to a record-set ting 6,904 high school students during the past 
school year, the Maine children's cancer program, t he Red Cross, Special Olympics and 
countless organizations in communities across Maine .  In the past 14 years, Maine credit unions 
have contributed more than 430,000 volunteer hours,  including nearly 41,000 hours last year, to 
their communities, an effort that makes a significa nt and positive impact not only on the 
organizations that receive this assistance but also  on the people who are served by and benefit 
from the services and resources that they provide; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  since 1921 Maine's credit unions have been contribu ting to the betterment of 
the lives of thousands of Maine people, who have be en helped to achieve financial success and 
stability.  Throughout Maine, credit unions continu e to play a vital economic and socially 
responsible role in the lives of individuals and re main a local, significant and stable presence in 
the communities they serve; now, therefore, be it 
 
 RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature

Union League and Maine's credit unions for their po sitive contributions and the significant role

Maine is a better place because of the service, ded ication and contributions of Maine's credit 
unions; and be it further
