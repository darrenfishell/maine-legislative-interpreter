 Tuesday, January 31, 2017 Page 37  
 
the production of information that the Legislature needs to conduct its business, including the 
business of reviewing pending and proposed legislat ion and the preparation of budget and tax 
policies. A joint standing committee or joint selec t committee, or a subcommittee of a joint 
standing committee or joint select committee, is gr anted the power to administer oaths, issue 
subpoenas and compel the testimony of witnesses and  the production of any papers, books, 
documents and testimony pursuant to the following p rocedure.  The exercise by a joint standing 
committee of powers in accordance with this rule is  not governed by Title 3, section 165. 
1.  Request to Presiding Officers.   When the duties assigned to a joint standing comm ittee 
or joint select committee or any subcommittee there of so require, the Senate chair of the 
committee or subcommittee may submit to the presidi ng officers a request for that committee or 
subcommittee to administer oaths, issue subpoenas f or the attendance of Maine state government 
officials and compel the testimony of witnesses and  the production of papers, books, documents 
and testimony. Any request from the Senate chair mu st clearly state, and thereby limit, the 
subject matter and scope of the study or inquiry. 
2.  Presiding Officers May Authorize.   Upon receipt of a request submitted in accordance  
with subsection 1, the presiding officers may joint ly authorize the Senate chair of the committee 
or subcommittee, in the sole discretion of the chai r, to issue such subpoenas on behalf of the 
committee or subcommittee. 
3.  Requirements of Subpoena.   The subpoena must specify the subject matter on w hich 
information is being sought, the type of informatio n requested, the date and place for which the 
initial appearance is requested and the amount of t ime estimated for the testimony requested. The 
subpoena must provide a reasonable amount of time f or a person to locate relevant documents 
and to prepare information and testimony sought. 
In the alternative, the subpoena may be directed to  the head of a particular department or agency 
and may direct the person to designate a person wit h knowledge of the indicated subject matter 
to respond and comply with the subpoena and provide  all appropriate documents. 
The subpoena continues to be in effect if a hearing  is recessed, but not for a period to exceed 30 
days. 
4.  Testimony.   Testimony by subpoenaed officials may not be take n under oath unless there 
is a 3/4 vote of committee or subcommittee members present to do so.  An oath must be 
administered by the Senate chair of the committee o r subcommittee. 
5.  Appeal.   If a person who has been subpoenaed asserts that the subpoena is frivolous, 
unreasonable or unrelated to the legitimate work of  the committee or subcommittee or seeks 
information that is privileged or otherwise protect ed from public disclosure, the person may 
appeal the issuance of the subpoena to the Legislat ive Council and the Legislative Council may 
quash the subpoena upon the affirmative vote of 6 m embers. 
6.  Protective Order.   If a person who has been subpoenaed asserts that information sought  
is privileged or otherwise protected from public di sclosure in the committee, the subcommittee 
or the Legislature and the Legislative Council does  not afford the person the relief the person 
requests, that person may petition for a protective  order from the Superior Court for Kennebec 
County in the same manner as provided in Rule 26(c)  of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. 
7.  Enforcement.   The presiding officers may seek to enforce a subp oena by application to 
the Superior Court for Kennebec County pursuant to the procedures set out in the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 3, section 162, subsection 4 and Ti tle 3, section 165, subsection 7.
