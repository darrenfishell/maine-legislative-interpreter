COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "4' to H.P. 149, L.D. 193 
1 13-A. Retirement funds. Retirement funds to the extent those funds are in a fund or 
2 account that is exempt from taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 
3 1986, Section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457 or 50l(a), up to an aggregate value of 
4 $1,000,000. This subsection does not exempt: 
5 A. Amounts contributed to the account or fund within 120 days before: 
6 (1) The debtor files for bankruptcy if this exemption is being applied in a federal

12 order against which this exemption is being applied; or 
13 B. Amounts in the account or fund necessary to satisfy child support or spousal 
14 support obligations.' 
15 SUMMARY 
16 This amendment replaces the bill by enacting a separate subsection governing the 
17 exemption from attachment of retirement accounts to match the same exemption in the 
18 United States Banlauptcy Code. The new subsection caps the exemption at an aggregate 
19 value of $1,000,000 for individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred 
20 arrangements that are exempt under the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 United States 
21 Code, Section 522(d)(l2). The amendment provides that amounts contributed within the 
22 120 days before either the bankruptcy action is filed or the judgment against the debtor or 
23 the issuance of the levy or other attachment is issued are not exempt. Amounts necessary 
24 to satisfy child support or spousal support obligations are also not exempt from 
25 attachment or banlauptcy. 
26 The amendment also updates a cross-reference to the United States Internal Revenue 
27 Code of 1986, which replaced the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
