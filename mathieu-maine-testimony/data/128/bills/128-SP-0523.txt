WHEREAS, every person is endowed with human dignity and valu e; and 
WHEREAS, redemption and second chances are American values; and 
WHEREAS, an estimated 65 million American citizens have a cr iminal record; and 
WHEREAS, individuals returning from prison and those who hav e paid their debts after 
committing a crime face a "second prison" of stigma  and obstacles, also known as collateral 
consequences; and 
WHEREAS, individuals with criminal histories encounter signi ficant barriers such as an 
inability to find housing, employment or education,  regain voting rights, volunteer in their 
communities, secure identification documentation an d pay off substantial financial debt accrued 
as a result of conviction and incarceration; and 
WHEREAS, these barriers can contribute to recidivism, which increases victimization, 
decreases public safety and results in lost human c apital and economic output for communities; 
and 
WHEREAS, the designation of April as Second Chance Month can  contribute to increased 
public awareness about the "second prison," the nee d for closure for those who have paid their 
debts and opportunities for individuals, employers,  congregations and communities to extend 
second chances; now, therefore, be it 
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty- eighth Legislature 
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on beha lf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to recognize April 2017 as Second Chanc e Month, and we urge citizens to observe 
this month through actions and programs that promot e awareness of the "second prison" and 
provide closure for those who have paid their debts .
