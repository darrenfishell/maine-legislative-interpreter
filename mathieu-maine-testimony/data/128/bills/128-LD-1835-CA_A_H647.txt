This bill requires the one-time transfer by June 30, 2018 
of $600,000 from the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife (IFW) General Fund carrying account to the IFW License and Registration General Fund account to fund a 
personal services shortfall that occurred because the savings anticipated through attrition did not materialize in fiscal 
year 2017-18 and additional financial obligations as a result of collective bargaining agreements.
