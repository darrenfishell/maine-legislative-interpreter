21 school year,  the commissioner shall review and make recommendations for objective 
22 measures that may be used to substantiate school  certifications of postsecondary  
23 readiness.
24 SUMMARY
25 This bill changes  the requirement  in the system of learning results, which is the 
26 foundation for Maine's proficiency-based diploma, from  "career and education 
27 development" to "vocational preparation  and practical life skills," which will allow the 
28 Department of Education to emphasize experiential instruction of students, regardless of 
29 career choice or pathway, that develops their understanding of interests, aptitudes and 
30 options related  to work and study; develops core workplace skills in areas such as 
31 planning, communication, problem solving,  teamwork  and computer applications;  and 
32 includes practical workplace and home economics experiences that maximize  learning  
33 through hands-on application  when  it revises the standards and rules to reflect the 
34 emphasis on those elements going  forward.
