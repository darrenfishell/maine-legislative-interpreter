15 (2)  Has substantial insurance operations in the United States, but not in this

groupwide s
upervisor for any other insurance holding company system that has 24

 determine that the superintendent is the appropriate groupwide 26 
supervisor fo
r an insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations 27 
concentrated in this State or may
 acknowle dge that a regulatory official from another 28 
jurisdiction i
s the appropriate groupwide supervisor for the insurance group.  The 29 
superintendent shall consider the follo

supervisor;  2 
3 (5)  Whether another regulatory official is acting or is seeking to act as the 
groupwide supervisor un
der a regulator y system that the superintendent 4

ines to be:  5 
6 (a)  Substantially similar to the system  of regulation provided under the laws

de supervision under this subsection, the superintendent 14 
shall acknowledge that regulator
y official  as the groupwide supervisor and may not 15 
consider designating t
he superintendent as the groupwide supervisor under paragraph 16 
B unless there is a 
material change in  the insurance group that results in:  17 
18 (1)  The insurance group's insurers domiciled in this State holding the largest 
share of the group'
s premiums, assets or liabilities; or  19 
20 (2)  This State being the place of domicile of  the top-tiered insurer or insurers in

 Page 26 - 128LR0770(01)-1 
 
1 alternative action as authorized under paragra phs A and B.  If the superintendent takes 
those actions, the 
mandatory control level ev ent is deemed sufficient grounds for the 2 
superintendent to take action un
der chapter 57, and the superintendent has the rights, 3 
powers and duties with respect to the

57, subchapte
r 2 pertaining to summary proceedings.  7

 finds there is a reasonable expectation that 9 
the mandatory control leve
l event may be eliminated within the 90-day period.  10 
11 B.  In the case of a property and casualty insurer that is not authorized to write new 
business, the superintendent may
 allow the in surer to continue to run off its existing 12 
business under the superin
tendent's supervision if the superintendent determines that 13 
there will be sufficient fu
nds to meet the insurer's obligations as they become due.  14

The information listed in paragraph A or B may be shared on a confidential basis in 28 
accordance w
ith section 216, subsection 5 but  may not be made public or be subject to

d 35 
risk-based ca
pital plans may not be used by  the superintendent for purposes of rate 36 
review, cons
idered or used as evidence in  any rate proceeding or used by the 37 
38 superintendent to calculate or derive an
y elements of an appropriate premium level or

2.  Risk-based capital plan.   When a company action level event or , regulatory 
action level event or authorized control level event3 
 with respect to a foreign insurer 
occurs, as determined under laws governing ri sk-based capital applicable in the state of 
domicile of the insurer, or, if no such risk-based  capital provision is in force in that state, 
under the provisions of this chapter, if the insurance superintendent of the state of 
domicile of the foreign insurer fails to require the foreign insurer to file a risk-based 
capital plan in the manner specified under the laws governing risk-based capital in that 
state, or, if no such risk-based capital provision is in force in that state, under this chapter, 
the superintendent may require the foreign in surer to file a risk-based capital plan with 
the superintendent.  In this event, the failure  of the foreign insurer to file a risk-based 
capital plan with the superintendent is grounds  to order the insurer to desist from writing 
new insurance business in this State. 4

41 SUMMARY 
This bill updates sev
eral provisions of th e Maine Insurance Code to incorporate 
recent amendments to model laws adopted by the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners, or NAIC, and makes related technical changes.  These amendments 
maintain the State's compliance with uniform financial solvency standards and with the 
NAIC's accreditation requirements for state insurance regulators. 
Part A enhances regulatory oversight and complies with NAIC accreditation 
requirements by requiring domestic insurance carriers to file corporate governance annual 
disclosure reports and clarifying the filing requi rement for quarterly financial statements.  
These requirements apply to health mainte nance organizations, nonprofit hospital and 
medical service organizations and fraternal benefit societies as well as to traditional commercial insurance companies.  Part A al so updates the procedures for examinations 
and holding company supervision for health  maintenance organizations, updates other 
financial reporting laws to conform to current requirements and clarifies the applicability of statutory accounting principles to nonprof it hospital and medical service organizations. 
Part B facilitates coordinated regulatory action and complies with NAIC accreditation 
requirements by incorporating a group supe rvision framework.  It amends the law 
regarding Maine insurance holding companies and examination laws to update obsolete 
references to the former NAIC Examiners' Ha ndbook.  It clarifies the Superintendent of 
Insurance's ability to hire examiners with  any necessary credentials. It resolves 
inconsistencies in the criminal convicti on reporting requirements and clarifies that 
dividend payments and affiliate transac tions are aggregated over any consecutive 12-
month period for purposes of applying statutory materiality thresholds. 
Part C amends the law regarding credit for reinsurance to allow the Superintendent of 
Insurance to waive certain requirements a nd to incorporate the recently developed 
framework establishing uniform minimum collateral requirements for reserve financing transactions. 
Part D corrects a conflict between state and federal insolvency laws and clarifies the 
priority of secured claims and federal claims. 
Part E updates the Maine Business Transact ed with Broker-Controlled Insurer Act to 
conform it to the current NAIC model act and comply with NAIC accreditation 
requirements.  It corrects an inconsistenc y by clarifying the law's applicability to 
domestic risk retention groups, and it repl aces obsolete references to "brokers" with 
references to "producers."  Part E also clarif ies a definition of "licensed insurer," amends 
the disclosure section to treat the producer rather  than the insurer as the controlling party, 
removes superfluous enforcement language and repeals an obsolete transition clause. 
Part F makes technical corrections to the risk-based capital standards laws to address 
issues identified during the most recent Department of Professional and Financial

23 24 Regulation, Bureau of Insurance accreditation review.  These amendments codify current practice 
and maintain compliance with NAIC accreditation requirements, clarifying that 
the solvent run-off exception to mandatory c ontrol does not apply to health insurers, 
clarifying that confidential risk-based capital information may be shared with other public 
officials and agencies on the same basis as  other confidential regulatory information, 
providing that risk-based capital information may not be used for rate-making purposes 
except to the extent that ratemaking and rela ted activities are part of a corrective action 
for a risk-based capital impaired insurer a nd clarifying that the corrective action plan 
requirements for foreign insurers  apply at all action levels. 
Part G updates the captive insurance co mpanies laws to respond to emerging 
regulatory issues and to make technical corr ections.  It clarifies the definitions of 
"controlled unaffiliated business" and "pur e nonprofit captive insurance company" and 
clarifies that a captive insurance company' s license application's supporting documents 
must include a plan of operation and that the additional supporting documents required 
for sponsored captive insurers are subject to the same confidentiality provisions as the other supporting documents.  It corrects obs olete references to manager-managed limited 
liability companies and updates the reporting provisions for association and industrial 
captive insurers consistent with Part A of the bill.  It provides that statutory rather than generally accepted accounting principles audits are to be filed when the captive insurer 
uses statutory accounting principles as its general basis of accounting, requires a sponsored captive insurer's plan of opera tion to specify how assets and liabilities are 
attributed between the protected cells and the general account and clarifies that a sponsored captive insurer's obligations to rein surers follow the reinsured participant and 
not the general account.
