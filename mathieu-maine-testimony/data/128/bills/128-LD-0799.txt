2016 and took effect  January 30, 2017; and  4 
Whereas, the Act, as amended by Public Law 2017, chapter 1, allows a person to 5 
cultivate marijuana for personal use and use marijuana or marijuana concentrate at that 6 
person's residence or another private residence, regardless of who  owns the residence; 7 
and 8 
Whereas, this provision impinges on the ability of a landlord to reduce the risk to 9 
tenants and property by prohibiting smoking on the property owned by that landlord; and  10

as soon as possible; and  12

SUMMARY  28 
This bill allows a landlord to restrict or prohibit the cultivation, possession or use of 29 
marijuana on residential premises rented by that landlord.  This bill, similar to the law 30 
allowing a landlord to restrict smoki ng of tobacco on leased premises, requires the 31 
landlord to develop a policy regarding the allowance or prohibition of the cultivation, 32 
possession or use of marijuana, detailing those areas where it is allowed or prohibited, 33 
and provide notice of the policy  to tenants and prospective tenants.  This bill does not 34 
give a person who is aggrieved by the failure of the landlord to provide the policy or 35 
another tenant to abide by the policy a cause of action against the landlord.  36
