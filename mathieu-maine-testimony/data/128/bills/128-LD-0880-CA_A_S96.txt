128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "k" to S.P. 280, L.D. 880, Bill, "An Act To Protect 
a Homeowner's Equity of Redemption in a Foreclosure Action" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 14 MRSA ยง6322, 2nd ,r, as corrected by RR 2013, c. 2, ยง27, is amended 
to read: 
If the court determines that such a breach exists, a judgment of foreclosure and sale 
must issue providing that if the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successors, heirs and 
assigns do not pay the sum that the court adjudges to be due and payable, with interest 
within the period of redemption, the mortgagee shall proceed with a sale as provided. 
Notwithstanding section 6704, for property described in section 6111, a writ of 
possession may not issue until the expiration of the period of redemption provided for in 
this section, except that this section does not impair the right of a mortgagee to exercise 
rights set forth in the mortgage or security instrument to protect the mortgaged property. 
If the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successors, heirs and assigns pay to the mortgagee the 
sum that the court adjudges to be due and payable to the mortgagee with interest within 
the period of redemption, then the mortgagee shall forthwith discharge the mortgage and 
file a dismissal of the action for foreclosure with the clerk of the court.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment incorporates the provision in the bill that provides that a writ of 
possession may not issue in a foreclosure action that involves a residential mortgage until 
the mortgagor's period of redemption expires. The amendment also clarifies that the 
provision in the bill does not impair the right of a mortgagee to exercise rights set forth in 
the mortgage or security instrument to protect the mortgaged property.
