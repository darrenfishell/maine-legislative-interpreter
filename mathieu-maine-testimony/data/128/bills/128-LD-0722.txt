 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA §2902, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2005, c. 591, §1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
1.  A policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use 4 
of any m otor vehicle may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this State with respect 5 
to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, unless coverage is 6 
provided in the policy or supplemental to the policy for the protection of persons i nsured 7 
under the policy who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of 8 
uninsured, underinsured or hit -and-run motor vehicles, for bodily injury, sickness or 9 
disease, including death, sustained by an insured person resulting from th e ownership, 10 
maintenance or use of such uninsured, underinsured or hit -and-run motor vehicle.  The 11 
coverage required by this section may be referred to as "uninsured vehicle coverage."  For 12 
the purposes of this section, "underinsured motor vehicle" means a  motor vehicle for 13 
which coverage is provided, but in amounts less than the minimum limits for bodily 14 
injury liability insurance provided for under the motorist's financial responsibility laws of 15 
this State or less than the limits of the injured party's un insured vehicle coverage.  For the 16 
purposes of this section, an umbrella or excess policy that provides excess limits to a 17 
policy described in Title 29 -A, section 1605 must also provide uninsured vehicle 18 
coverage equal to the limits of liability purchased,  unless the named insured rejects such 19 
coverage in writing.  Rejection of such coverage by a named insured constitutes a 20 
rejection of coverage by all insureds under the policy, applies to all persons and vehicles 21 
then or thereafter eligible to be covered u nder the policy and remains effective upon 22 
policy amendment or renewal, unless the named insured requests such coverage in 23 
writing.  24 
Sec. 2.  24-A MRSA §2902, sub -§8 is enacted to read:  25 
8.  A document tendered to settle a claim for bodily injury that may be  the subject of 26 
coverage under this section must prominently contain the following language, which must 27 
be read and signed by the releasing party or parties:  28 
"WARNING  29 
IF YOU SIGN THIS RELEASE YOU MAY FORFEIT YOUR RIGHT TO 30 
UNINSURED VEHICLE INSURANCE BENEFI TS FROM YOUR OWN 31 
AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICY, UMBRELLA POLICY OR OTHER EXCESS 32 
INSURANCE POLICY.  CONSULT WITH YOUR INSURANCE AGENT, YOUR 33 
INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR YOUR ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING.  34 
I certify that I have read the above warning and fully understan d it."  35 
SUMMARY  36 
This bill explicitly provides that the laws governing uninsured vehicle coverage apply 37 
to umbrella policies and excess policies.  It also requires that documents tendered to settle 38 
a claim for bodily injury that may be the subject of coverag e under the laws governing 39 
uninsured vehicle coverage contain a warning to ensure that persons settling bodily injury 40

 claims understand that by signing a release they may be giving up their right to uninsured 1 
vehicle insurance benefits from other sources, including their own insurance companies.  2
