Fiscal Note 
Change in Treatment Requires Cost Neutrality 
This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to apply by January I, 2018 for 
authorization from the United States DHHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to develop a pilot project tc 
treat alcohol abuse disorders, substance abuse disorders and co-occurring disorders using the National Acupuncture 
Detoxification Association auricular acupuncture protocol. The project may last no longer than 2 years and must be 
reimbursable as allowed under the federal Medicaid system. It is also required that the pilot project be cost neutral or 
result in savings. To achieve cost neutrality the pilot project would serve individuals who would have been served by 
treatment methods other than acupuncture and not increase the total number of individuals provided treatment.
