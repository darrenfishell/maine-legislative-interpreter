SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provisions of the bill that eliminate the requirement that 
interest accrues on deferred propetiy taxes and provides that interest accmes on deferred 
propetiy taxes at the prime rate published in the Wall Street Joumal minus one percentage 
point. The amendment adds a maximum asset standard for eligibility of property owners 
and provides that prope1iy may not be subject to deferral under both the state deferral 
program and a municipal deferral program. The amendment also provides an 
appropriation to cover the cost of state administration of the program and the initial cost 
of making payments to municipalities for deferred taxes.
