FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 85, L.D. 117, Bill, "An Act To 
Strengthen the Fann and Open Space Tax Law" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §1102, sub-§4, 1C is enacted to read: 
C. A parcel of land that is located on an island may not be considered contiguous to 
another parcel of land that is not located on the same island if the parcels of land are 
separated by water at the normal high-water mark or high tide. A parcel of land 
located on an island that was included within a parcel classified as farmland before 
April l, 2017 and that is excluded from classification as farmland under this 
paragraph must be considered as land classified as open space land unless the owner 
withdraws the land from classification under this subchapter.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and amends the definition of "farmland" to provide 
that, for purposes of classification as farmland under the farm and open space tax law, a 
parcel of land that is located on an island may not be considered contiguous to another 
parcel of land that is not located on the same island if the parcels of land are separated by 
water at the normal high-water mark or high tide.
