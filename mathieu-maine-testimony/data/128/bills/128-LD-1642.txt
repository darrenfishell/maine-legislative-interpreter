SUMMARY  26 
This bill clarifies one of the criteria that qualify a person who is licensed to 27 
manufacture liquor in the State to also have an establishment licensed for the sale of 28 
liquor to be consumed on the licensed premises.  The bill requires that the person have a 29 
controll ing interest in both the manufacturing business and the on -premises 30 
establishment, regardless of the business structure of either entity.  Under current law, 31 
and as applicable to this bill, "person" is defined as an individual, partnership, 32 
corporation, fi rm, association or other legal entity.  33 
The bill also temporarily prohibits the Department of Administrative and Financial 34 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations from suspending,  35

Fiscal Detail and NotesFiscal Note
Minor revenue increase - General Fund
Clarifications to the criteria that allow entities licensed to manufacture liquor also to have an establishment licensed 
for the sale of liquor to be consumed on the licensed premises will allow more entities to seek licensure from the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations.  The additional licenses are anticipated to result in a minor increase in General Fund revenue.  128th MAINE LEGISLATURE
