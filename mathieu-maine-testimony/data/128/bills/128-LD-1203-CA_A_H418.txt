FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 839, L.D. 1203, Bill, "An Act To 
Increase Transparency in Cooperative Agreements within the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in ยง9 by striking out all of subsections 1 to 4 (page 1, 
lines 15 to 37 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'1. Public posting. The department shall annually post a description of each 
cooperative agreement or arrangement entered into in accordance with this section during 
the previous fiscal year on the department's publicly accessible website. The description 
must include the expected benefits to the State, the department, the regulated community 
and the public. 
2. Biennial report. Beginning in 2019, and every odd-numbered year thereafter, the 
department shall report no later than March 1st to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over agricultural matters regarding the cooperative 
agreements and arrangements entered into in accordance with this section during the 2 
previous fiscal years.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the requirements in the bill that the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry provide public notice of each cooperative 
agreement or arrangement, solicit public comments, provide responses to public 
comments and consider requests submitted in writing to decline to receive future funding 
from a cooperative agreement or arrangement. It also changes the requirement to report 
to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over agricultural 
matters regarding the cooperative agreements and arrangements entered into from an 
annual requirement to a biennial requirement. The amendment also requires the 
department to post on its publicly accessible website a description of each cooperative 
agreement or arrangement entered into during the previous fiscal year, including the 
expected benefits to the State, the department, the regulated community and the public.
