be repealed on October 1, 2017, and that date will likely pass before the 90-day period 
expires; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by inserting at the end before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'
