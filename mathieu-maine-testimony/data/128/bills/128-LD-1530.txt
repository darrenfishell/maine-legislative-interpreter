SUMMARY  4 
The purpose of this bill is to bring consistency to Maine's employment security law 5 
and bring it into  compliance with changes in federal law. The bill:  6 
1.  Repeals outdated provisions;  7 
2.  Provides that nominal fees or stipends paid to a volunteer are excluded from the 8 
definition of wages and specifies that a volunteer does not meet the definition of 9 
"emp loyee";  10 
3.  Clarifies the status of workers with specific disabilities who are not eligible for 11 
unemployment in order to be consistent with changes to state and federal wage and hour 12 
laws;  13 
4.  Reflects changes to a program name in the federal law;  14 
5.  Spec ifies that unemployment benefits will not be awarded to an employee during a 15 
mutually agreed -upon leave or sabbatical leave from the employee's employer;  16 
6.  Provides that a reduction in hours initiated by the employee and agreed upon by 17 
the employee and e mployer does not qualify the employee for unemployment benefits;  18 
7.  Amends the requalification amount specified under the provision governing 19 
absence from work due to incarceration so as to align with the requalification amount 20 
specified in provisions gov erning discharge from work due to misconduct;  21 
8.  Amends the definition of "intermittent employment" to specify that employees 22 
who have the same reduction in hours of work each year due to the cyclical nature of 23 
their employers' business are not eligible f or work -sharing benefits; and  24 
9.  Specifies that an employer's experience rating may not be charged when an 25 
employee has requested an unpaid, voluntary reduction in hours.  26
