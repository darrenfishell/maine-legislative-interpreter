18 SUMMARY
19 Over a 2-year  transition period, this bill moves responsibility for providing special 
20 education and related services for children who are at least 3 years of age and under 6 
21 years of age from  the Child Development Services System,  state intermediate educational 
22 unit to the school administrative units  of residence of the children.  Under the bill, 
23 beginning July 1, 2018, a school administrative  unit that is the unit of residence for a 
24 child with a disability who is at least 3 years of age and under  6 years of age may become 
25 responsible for providing special education and related services to that child through the 
26 implementation of an early adopter program.  The bill amends several  sections of law by 
27 removing references to  the Child  Development Services System.
28 This bill eliminates the Child Development  Services System and moves the entire 
29 responsibility for providing services to children  from birth to under  3 years of age to the 
30 Department of Education's  office of special  services.  The funding plan continues  the 
31 present arrangement  of full responsibility for costs being  shared by state funds, federal 
32 funds, the MaineCare program and private insurers.
33 The intent of the changes  to the Child Development Services  System statutes are 
34 based on the belief  that children with disabilities are best served  by their local  
35 communities; children do better when there are fewer  transition points; there are 
36 efficiencies that can be achieved  by eliminating duplicative state functions and by 
37 maximizing existing services  and facilities at the local level; and the State should 
38 continue its current  practice of funding all services  for preschool  children with disabilities 
39 that are not paid for with federal  funds, through the MaineCare program or from  private 
40 sources.
