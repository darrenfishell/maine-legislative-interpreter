14 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·e "to S.P. 676, L.D. 1805 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes Part A of the bill because its provisions are addressed in 
separate legislation. It substitutes a separate provision clarifying that the State Tax 
Assessor may require a bond from a taxpayer as a condition of sales tax registration 
whether the registration is made under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 
1754-B or 1756 or under section 1951-B, which was enacted during the First Regular 
Session of the 128th Legislature. The amendment also provides that a report from the 
State Tax Assessor to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
over taxation matters regarding the new major business headquarters expansion credit 
must separately state the amount of lost revenue attributable to credits used to reduce tax 
liability and the amount attributable to refundable credits. Finally, the amendment makes 
a technical correction to the bill preserving a necessary statutory cross-reference.
