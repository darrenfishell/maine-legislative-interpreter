This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $400,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $280,000 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Maine Community College System to implement the requirements of this legislation. Of these 
amounts, $120,000 is provided on a one-time basis in fiscal year 2017-18 for the purchase of walk-through metal 
detectors to be installed in residence halls at all campuses throughout the system. Additionally, $280,000 per year 
beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 is provided for the ongoing costs of implementing and administering additional 
security measures at all of the community college campuses. 
Additonal costs to the University of Maine System and the Maine Maritime Academy associated with increasing 
safety measures to ensure that no firearms or ammunition are brought into residence halls or public entertainment 
facilities can not be estimated at this time, but are expected to be significant.
