17 COMMl1TEE AMENDMENT ·A "ID H.P. 1082, L.D. 1571 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
amendment extends the date by which a patty may qualify as a party by submitting an 
application to the Secretary of State with the required number of voters enrolled in the 
proposed party. The amendment also provides that a patty has 2 general election cycles 
to enroll the required number of voters to maintain patty status. CutTent law provides for 
one general election cycle to emoll the required 10,000 voters. Like the bill, the 
amendment establishes an appeal process if the Secretary of State denies an application 
for party qualification. These changes to the process of party qualification are intended to 
address legal issues raised by the Libertarian Party of Maine in a lawsuit filed in 2016, 
Libertarian Party of Maine v. Dunlap, Docket No. 2: 16-cv-00002-JA W, and addressed 
by the United States District Court in a preliminary injunction order issued on May 27, 
2016. 
This amendment also provides that the party qualifications in this amendment apply 
retroactively to November 1, 2016.
