17 SUMMARY 
18 This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title to reflect the content of the 
19 amendment. 
20 Current law does not expressly address bear baiting on public reserved lands. The 
21 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Parks and Lands has 
22 adopted rules under its general authority to manage public lands to provide a permitting 
23 system for bear baiting on public lands. The rules do not specifically address bear baiting 
24 at sites that are not accessible by road but are accessible by water. The bureau has 
25 recently determined that pennits will no longer be issued for sites accessible by water. 
26 This amendment requires the bureau to amend its rules expressly to permit bear 
27 baiting at sites that are not accessible by road but are accessible by water. It also requires 
28 the bureau to issue a permit to place bear bait at a site not accessible by road but 
29 accessible by water to any licensed Maine guide who applies in 2017 for such a permit if 
3 0 the applicant held such a permit for that site in 2016 and has not become ineligible for 
31 such a permit, unless the bureau finds there is a valid land management reason placement 
32 of bait at the site is no longer feasible and the bureau provides the applicant a written 
33 explanation of that reason. If the permit is denied for a valid land management reason, 
34 the bureau must work with the applicant to seek to find a suitable alternative site that 
35 meets the needs of the applicant. 
36 This amendment directs the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the 
37 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to issue a revised lease of land in 
38 Township 16, Range 6 current as of the effective date of this Act from the State to Eagle 
39 Lake Sp01iing Camps, that changes its te1m from 15 years to 30 years, notwithstanding 
40 the limitation in cunent law for such leases to be no longer than 15 years. The 
41 amendment also provides for successive renewals for terms of 3 0 years each as long as 
42 the land continues to be used for a year-round spotiing camp or Class A restaurant and

1 lodge open to the public, as specified in the lease agreement, and the lessee complies with 
2 all other te1ms and conditions of the lease and all other applicable laws and rules of the 
3 State. The lessee may request such a 30-year renewal during the 10 calendar years prior 
4 to the end of the term of any then-existing lease. A renewal commences at the end of the 
5 term of the then-existing lease. The director is also authorized to allow, on reasonable 
6 terms and conditions, a transfer of the leasehold interests to another entity if the Eagle 
7 Lake Sporting Camps business is sold to another entity, as long as the sale of the business 
8 is at an appraised fair market value and the leased land continues to be used for a 
9 year-round spotting camp or Class A restaurant and lodge open to the public, as specified 
10 in the lease agreement, and the transferee agrees to comply with all terms and conditions 
11 of the lease and all other applicable laws and rules of the State. 
12 This amendment also adds an emergency preamble and emergency clause to the bill, 
13 but the provisions relating to the Eagle Lake Sporting Camps take effect 90 days after the 
14 adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature.

Future biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Any additional costs to Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry from amending the rnles regarding bear 
baiting on public reserved lands to include sites that are accessed by water only are anticipated to be minor and can be 
absorbed within budgeted resources. Provisions in the bill that amend lease terms of certain parcels of public reserved 
land would result in an increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue. The amount of revenue received will not 
be known until the current lease is renewed.
