Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill exempts a motor vehicle less than 12 years .old from inspection and would result in a reduction in Highway 
Fund revenue of $1,575,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $2,100,000 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. This analysis 
assumes that 60% of all vehicles inspected are less than 12 years old.
