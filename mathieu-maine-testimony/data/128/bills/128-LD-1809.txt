2 Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §9321, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 1979, c. 545, §3, is amended 
3 to read:
4 3.  Delegation.   The director may delegate the issuance of permits to forest  rangers  or 
5 town forest fire wardens and their deputies.  A town  forest  fire warden or deputy 
6 authorized to issue permits  pursuant to this subsection may issue permits using burn 
7 permit software  purchased from a private  party  to establish  a publicly  accessible  online 
8 system in accordance with section 9327.
9 Sec. 2.  12 MRSA  §9327 is enacted  to read:
10 §9327.  Private party  burn permit software
11 The director  shall allow a municipality to use burn permit  software purchased from a 
12 private party to establish a publicly accessible  online system to issue a permit  to burn 
13 pursuant to section 9325 if the issuance of a permit to burn using the burn permit software 
14 is in accordance  with the criteria  in section 9321.  The director  shall  approve  burn permit  
15 software within  10 business  days after a town forest fire warden or deputy submits  a 
16 request for review of the software to the director if the software submitted meets the 
17 requirements of this section.  If the director  does not approve or deny the burn permit  
18 software within  10 business  days after a town forest fire warden or deputy submits  a 
19 request for review, the municipality may use the burn permit  software to issue permits to 
20 burn.  If a person  uses burn permit software to apply for a permit  to burn, that person may 
21 not be charged a fee for the permit.  A person may not be required  to apply for a permit to 
22 burn using  approved burn permit software,  but may apply  as otherwise  provided  in this 
23 article.  The director  may adopt rules  relating  to burn permit software requirements.  
24 Rules adopted pursuant  to this section are major substantive rules as defined  in Title  5, 
25 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
26 SUMMARY
27 This bill requires the Director of the Bureau of Forestry  within the Department of 
28 Agriculture, Conservation  and Forestry to allow municipalities to use burn permit 
29 software purchased from a private party to issue a permit to burn if issuance  of the permit  
30 using the burn permit  software meets certain  statutory requirements.  The bill provides  
31 that a person may not be charged a fee for a permit to burn issued using  the burn permit 
32 software and that a person may apply  for a permit to burn using the burn permit software 
33 or as otherwise provided  in law.  The bill requires  the director to approve burn permit  
34 software within  10 days after a town forest  fire warden  or deputy  submits  a request  for 
35 review to the director  if the burn permit software meets the requirements for approval.   
36 The bill authorizes the director to adopt major substantive rules relating  to burn permit  
37 software requirements.
