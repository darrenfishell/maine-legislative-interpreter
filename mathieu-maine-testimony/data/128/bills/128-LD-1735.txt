Page 1 - 128LR2621(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, critical  and lifesaving emergency  medical  services are provided to 
4 patients on a daily basis in both rural and urban areas; and
5 Whereas, circumstances arise in which the provision of emergency medical services 
6 requires review for the purposes  of quality  improvement so that services may be 
7 delivered in a safe and efficient  manner that produces maximum benefit to the health  of 
8 the patient; and
9 Whereas, delay in reviews increases the risk of service delivery that may be less 
10 safe or less efficient  or does not produce  maximum benefit to the health of the patient;  
11 and
12 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
13 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
14 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
15 therefore,
16 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
