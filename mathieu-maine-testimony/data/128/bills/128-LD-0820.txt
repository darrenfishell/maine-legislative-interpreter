SUMMARY  13 
This bill amends the State's mining laws as follows.  14 
1.  It prohibits the issuance of a mining lease under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15 
12, chapter 201 -A, subchapter 3 if the propos ed mining operation is to be wholly or 16 
partially located in, on or under any designated land, state historic site, state park, public 17 
reserved land, submerged land or state -owned wildlife management area or the Allagash 18 
Wilderness Waterway.  The bill also prohibits the issuance of a mining permit under the 19 
Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act, referred to in this summary as the "Mining Act," if 20 
any part of the mining operation will be located wholly or partially in, on or under any of 21 
the same state lands.  22 
2.  It amends the definition of "mining area" under the Mining Act to restrict that 23 
definition to an area of land from which earth material is removed in connection with the 24 
mining of ore.  25 
3.  It amends the rule -making authority of the Department of Environme ntal 26 
Protection under the Mining Act to require that any rule or rule change proposed by the 27 
department in accordance with its authority under the Mining Act may not be finally 28 
adopted by the department unless legislation authorizing final adoption of such  rules is 29 
enacted into law.  30 
4.  It prohibits the placement of any mining operation under the Mining Act in, on or 31 
under a river, stream or brook, a great pond, a freshwater wetland or a coastal wetland.  32 
5.  It amends permit approval conditions under the Mi ning Act relating to discharges 33 
causing groundwater contamination by allowing only for limited contamination of 34 
groundwater within a mining area that does not result in contamination of groundwater 35 
beyond the mining area; contamination of groundwater withi n the mining area that 36 
exceeds certain water quality criteria for pollutants; contamination of groundwater within 37 
the mining area that exceeds a specified level determined by the department based on 38 
site-specific geologic and hydrologic characteristics and  in accordance with standards 39 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR1 442(01) -1 
 established by rule that are designed to minimize pollution from mining operations; or 1 
any violation of surface water quality standards.  2 
6.  It prohibits the placement of any mining operation under the Mining Act in, on or 3 
under a flood plain or a flood hazard area.  4 
7.  It requires an applicant for a permit or a permittee under the Mining Act to 5 
provide special financial assurance coverage for a worst -case catastrophic mining event 6 
or failure.  7 
8.  It requires the department, on  or before January 12, 2018, to provisionally adopt 8 
and submit to the Legislature for review major substantive rules relating to the Mining 9 
Act. 10
