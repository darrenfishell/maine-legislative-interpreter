 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, Public Law 2015, chapter 488 enacted a number of changes to the laws 3 
governing the Control led Substances Prescription Monitoring Program and the 4 
prescribing and dispensing of opioid medication and other drugs; and  5 
Whereas, the law requires that, beginning July 1, 2017, the aggregate amount of 6 
opioid medication prescribed to a patient may not be  in excess of 100 morphine milligram 7 
equivalents per day; and  8 
Whereas, health care providers have been working and will continue to work with 9 
those patients who have been taking medication in excess of this limit to develop a 10 
tapering plan to reduce their dose to the statutorily required limit by July 2017; and  11 
Whereas, there exist certain patients who, based on their prior dosage, medical 12 
history and current function, in their doctors' medical opinions cannot safely have their 13 
dosages tapered by the deadli ne established in the law; and  14 
Whereas, it is essential that for these individuals there be a system in place to 15

to prescribe doses in excess of 100 morphine mill igram equivalents per day; and  17

morphine milligram equivalents per day and directs the Department of Health and Human 24

bill c odifies in statute the exceptions adopted in the department's rules and adds an 26 
exception to prescribing limits for medical necessity.  27
