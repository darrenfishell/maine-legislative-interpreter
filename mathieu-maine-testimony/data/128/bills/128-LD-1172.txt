 1.  Amount.   A tax is imposed upon the transfer of real property and tangible 1 
personal property  situated in this State an d held by an individual who dies during the 2 
calendar year 2002 and who at the time of death was not a resident of this State.  When 3 
real or tangible personal  property has been transferred into a trust, the tax imposed by this 4 
section applies as if the trus t did not exist and the property was personally owned by the 5 
decedent.  Maine property is subject to the tax imposed by this section to the extent that 6 
such property is included in the decedent's gross estate as finally determined for federal 7 
estate tax pu rposes.  The amount of this tax is equal to the lesser of:  8 
A.  That proportion of the federal estate tax calculated prior to the application of the 9 
federal credit that the value of Maine real and tangible personal  property taxed in this 10 
State that qualifie s for the credit bears to the value of the decedent's total federal 11 
gross estate; and  12 
B.  That proportion of the federal credit divided by .75 that the value of Maine real 13 
and tangible personal  property taxed in this State that qualifies for the credit bea rs to 14 
the value of the decedent's total federal gross estate.  15 
The share of the federal credit used to determine the amount of a nonresident individual's 16 
estate tax under this section is computed without regard to whether the specific real or 17 
tangible perso nal property located in the State is marital deduction property.  18

provided in subsection 1 -A, section 6652 and section 6662, upon receipt of a timely and 22 
properly completed claim for reimbursement, the State Tax Assessor shall certify that the 23 
claimant is eligible for reimbursement under this chapter.  The assessor shall determine 24 
the benefit for each claimant and shall certify to the State Controller the amounts to be 25 
transferred to the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement reserve account established, 26 
maintained and administered by the State Controller from General Fund undedicated 27 
revenue.  28 
Sec. 26.  36 MRSA §6656, sub -§1-A, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 239, §2, is 29 
repealed.  30 
SUMMARY  31 
Current law requires all personal property, including machinery, to be assessed and 32 
taxed in the same manner as other property but exempts from taxation indivi dually owned 33 
personal property with a just value of less than $1,000, except for items used for 34 
industrial or commercial purposes and vehicles that are not subject to the excise tax.  35 
This bill repeals the provisions of law requiring a tax to be imposed on personal 36 
property and specifies that all individually owned personal property is exempt from 37 
taxation.  38 
This bill removes numerous references in the Maine Revised Statutes to the personal 39 
property tax.  40
