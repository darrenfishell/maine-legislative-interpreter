This bill includes General Fund appropriations 
of $3,430,082 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $3,686,307 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Retired Teachers' Health Insurance Program within the Department of Education for the costs 
associated with removing the cap on the increase in the State's total cost for retired teachers' health insurance 
premiums enacted in Public Law 2013, c. 368 and increasing the State's contribution to the cost of health insurance 
for retired teachers from 45% to 50% from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019. 
This legislation also requires the State's share to increase from 50% to 55% from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021 and 
then increase again to 60% after June 30, 2021. The cost of these increases is estimated to be $7,934,829 in fiscal year 
2019-20, $8,543,064 in fiscal year 2020-21 and $13,869,703 in fiscal year 2021-22. 
The Office of Fiscal and Program Review utilized data and assumptions provided in the State and Teachers Retiree 
Healthcare Plan, June 30, 2016 Actuarial Valuation to estimate the cost of this legislation. The total cost of this 
provision over time will depend on actual health premium cost inflation and the numbers of retired teachers in the 
future.
