128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 250, L.D. 805, Bill, "An Act To 
Streamline the Municipal Review Process When Dividing a Structure into 3 or More 
Dwelling Units and To Amend the Process for Recording Subdivision Variances" 
Amend the bill in section 4 in subsection 6 in the first line (page 3, line 29 in L.D.) by 
striking out the following: "A division" and inserting the following: 'Beginning July 1, 
2018, a division' 
Amend the bill in section 5 in paragraph B by striking out all of subparagraph (2) 
(page 4, lines 9 to 12 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'(2) The variance is not valid until recorded as provided in this paragraph. 
Recording must occur within 90 days 2 years of the final subdivision approval or 
approval under Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter Â± l, article 6, where applicable, 
whichever date is later, or the variance is void.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment provides that the exemption in the bill from the subdivision laws for 
the division of a new or existing structure in a municipality where a project is subject to 
municipal site plan review takes effect July 1, 2018. The amendment also requires that 
variances from subdivision criteria be recorded within 2 years of final subdivision 
approval; the bill removes a provision in current law requiring such recording within 90 
days.
