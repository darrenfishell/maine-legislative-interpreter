commercial or industrial use into 3 or more dwelling units within a 5 -year period.  11 
A.  In determining whether a tract or parcel of land is divided into 3 or more lots, the 12 
first dividing of the tract or parcel is considered to create the first 2 lots and the next 13 
dividing of either of these first 2 lots, by whomever accomplished, is considered to 14 
create a 3rd lot, unless:  15 
(1)  Both dividings are accomplished by a subdivider who has retained one of the 16 
lots for the subdivider's own use as a singl e-family residence that has been the 17 
subdivider's principal residence for a period of at least 5 years immediately 18 
preceding the 2nd division; or  19 
(2)  The division of the tract or parcel is otherwise exempt under this subchapter.  20 
B.  The dividing of a trac t or parcel of land and the lot or lots so made, which 21 
dividing or lots when made are not subject to this subchapter, do not become subject 22 
to this subchapter by the subsequent dividing of that tract or parcel of land or any 23 
portion of that tract or parcel .  The municipal reviewing authority shall consider the 24 
existence of the previously created lot or lots in reviewing a proposed subdivision 25 
created by a subsequent dividing.  26 
C.  A lot of 40 or more acres must be counted as a lot, except:  27 
(2)  When a munici pality has, by ordinance, or the municipal reviewing authority 28 
has, by regulation, elected not to count lots of 40 or more acres as lots for the 29

SUMMARY  13 
This bill amends the laws governing subdivisions.  The bill exempts from the law 14 
governing subdivisions a division of a structure into 3 or more dwelling units in a 15 
municipality where the project is subject to municipal site plan revie w.  The bill amends 16 
the provision concerning when a municipal ordinance may have a definition of 17 
"subdivision" that conflicts with state law.  The bill removes the authority of a 18 
municipality to expand the definition of "subdivision" to include the divisio n of a 19 
structure into commercial or industrial units.  The bill removes the requirement that 20 
variances from subdivision criteria be recorded in the registry of deeds within 90 days 21 
after final approval of a subdivision plan, but retains the requirement tha t the variance be 22 
recorded to be valid.  The bill repeals provisions under which leased dwelling units are 23 
not subject to subdivision review.  24
