Whereas, the validity of noise suppression device permits and the authority of the 
Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to issue noise suppression device permits 
for use of a noise suppression device with a firearm when hunting may expire before the 
effective date of nonemergency legislation passed during the current session of the 
Legislature; and 
Whereas, inunediately extending the validity of noise suppression device permits 
and the authority of the conunissioner to continue issuing noise suppression device 
permits will ensure the uninterrupted and continued use of noise suppression devices with 
firearms when hunting; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
inunediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by inserting at the end before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'
