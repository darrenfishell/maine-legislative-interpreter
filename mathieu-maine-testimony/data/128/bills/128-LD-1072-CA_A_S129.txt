7 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 'A "to S.P. 354, L.D. 1072 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, eliminates the 
portion of the bill that reduces the amount of time a dealer must wait before selling or 
altering an item containing precious metals received by the dealer. The amendment also 
limits the number and type of items containing precious metals that may be grouped 
together in one digital photograph. The amendment also allows municipalities to 
continue issuing permits for dealers rather than registering dealers if they choose to do so.
