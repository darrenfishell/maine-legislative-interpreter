Fiscal Note 
Current biennium savings -Federal Block Grant Fund 
This bill reduces the lifetime limit for receiving benefits through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) program from 60 months to 36 months. This will reduce total benefits paid out in a given year. Since these 
benefits are paid-using all Federal TANF Block Grant Funds, the savings will accrue in the block grant to be used in 
future years for TANF benefits. No funding will be returned to the federal government due to the changes in this bill.
