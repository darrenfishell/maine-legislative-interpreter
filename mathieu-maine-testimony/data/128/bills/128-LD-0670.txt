 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §2411, sub -§5-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 81, §1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
5-A.  Notice and custody.   The court shall give notice of a license suspension and 4 
shall take ph ysical custody of the driver's license, except when the defendant 5

State following an administrative suspension under section 2453 or 2453 -A for operating 7

court -ordered suspension.  9 
Sec. 2.  29-A MRSA §2434, sub -§4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 81, §2, is further 10 
amended to read:  11 
4.  Stay of suspension.   The court, on reasonable cause shown, may st ay a 12 
suspension for a period not to exceed 4 hours from the time of sentencing and issue 13 
evidence of that stay, unless the defendant demonstrates that the defendant's license was 14 
previously restored by the Secretary of State following an administrative sus pension 15 
under section 2453 or 2453 -A for operating under the influence based on the same facts 16 
and circumstances giving rise to the court -ordered suspension, in which case the court 17 
may stay a suspension for up to 7 days.  18 
SUMMARY  19 
Current law allows a defen dant to receive credit for an OUI alcohol administrative 20 
suspension already served from the Secretary of State upon receipt of a court suspension.  21 
Because there is a lag between the time the court orders the suspension and the Secretary 22 
of State applies t he credit for the administrative suspension, current law provides an 23 
exception that allows the court to stay the license suspension for up to 7 days.  This bill 24 
provides the same exception for OUI drug suspensions that is currently in effect for OUI 25 
alcoho l suspensions.  26
