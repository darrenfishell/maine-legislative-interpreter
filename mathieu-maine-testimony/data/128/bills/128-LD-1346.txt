or municipality where the burying ground is located or on historic or current maps of the 10

also be documented in the records of the register of deeds in the county where the burying 12 
ground was located when it was established or in the records of the municipality where 13 
the burying ground was when it was established, but the lack of documentation does not 14 
negate the existence of, or its status as, an ancient burying ground.  The lack of apparent 15
