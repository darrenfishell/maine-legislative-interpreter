administrator to compile a cumulative list of all apparent owners of presumed abandoned 33 
property having a total value of at least $10,000 that has been paid or delivered to the 34 
administrator  at least 36 months prior to the compiling of the list.  The administrator is 35 
required to release the list of apparent owners, without the property presumed abandoned 36 
and the value of that property, upon written request.  37
