23 does not limit the qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana to the use of forms of 
24 harvested marijuana that are not smoked or vaporized, including but not limited to edible 
25 marijuana and tinctures and salves of marijuana. A transplant evaluator may require 
26 meclical marijuana used by a qualifying patient to be tested for fungal contamination by a

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of$110,976 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Office of the 
Attorney General (OAG) to establish one full-time Assistant Attorney General position to advise the Department of 
Health and Human Services on the interpretation of new medical marijuana program provisions and to assist with the 
enforcement thereof. 
The bill also includes Other Special Revenue allocations to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 
$235,827 in fiscal year 2018-19 to establish 2 Field Investigator positions and 1 Office Specialist position to handle 
increased investigations. DHHS will also receive an allocation of $110,976 to reimburse the OAG for its new 
position. 
LRl 833(03) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 2 
C.i{_H~J~!J 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services of 
$111,294 in fiscal year 2018-19 for one Tax Examiner position and related costs to review and process income tax 
returns. There will be a reduction in General Fund revenue of $240, I 00 and a reduction in Local Government Fund 
revenue of $4,900 in fiscal year 2018-19 from allowing medical marijuana dispensaries and registered caregivers to 
deduct expenses from corporate and individual income tax. 
The bill requires that any new costs to the General Fund created by the bill be reimbursed through transfers from the 
Medical Use of Marijuana Fund in the Department of Health and Human Services to the unappropriated surplus of the 
General Fund. The transfer for fiscal year 2018-19 is estimated to be $351,394. 
The DHHS may receive requests from patients for reimbursement of the costs associated with obtaining a 2nd 
opinion, in cetiain circumstances. As it is not known how many individuals may make this request and how many 
individuals would receive reimbursement, no estimate of the increased costs is made at this time. 
The DHHS is also required to establish the medical marijuana research grant program to provide grant money to 
suppmi objective scientific research, including observational and clinical trials and existing research, on the efficacy 
of marijuana as part of medical treatment and the health effects of marijuana used as part of medical treatment. The 
program must be funded from the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund. The DHHS is required to adopt rules outlining 
requirements of the program including the amount of funds distributed and duration of the research, so no estimate of 
cost can be made at this time. 
Additionally, there is a potential increase in registration fees to the DHHS for facilities that registerto produce 
marijuana concentrate by a process involving inherently hazardous substances. Currently, manufacturing facilities are 
not required to register or notify the DHHS of their operations, so no estimates of the increase in registration fees or 
the increased costs to the DHHS for registration and auditing program compliance are made at this time. 
The bill also creates new registration tiers for manufacturing facilities, which could also increase the overall 
registration fees to the DHHS. As the decision to change the tier ofregistration lies with each provider, no estimate of 
the increase in registration fees are made at this time. 
The DHHS may no longer limit the number of registration cetiificates it issues to a person or entity to operate as a 
dispensary. Any new dispenseries would pay a $12,000 application fee, which would yield additional revenue. 
However, it is not know how many new registration ce1iificates will be awarded during the year, so no estimate of the 
increased revenue is made at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services for rnlemaking, to repoti to the legislature on 
the new electronic tracking portal and to consult with statewide associations representing licensed medical 
professionals to develop and provide educational materials related to medical marijuana to medical providers are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Allowing facilities that test medical marijuana samples to operate in the absence of rules, clarifying that qualified and 
non qualified persons may manufacture marijuana concentrate by a process of extraction not involving inherently 
hazardous substances and establishing a process for persons to become authorized to produce marijuana concentrate 
by a process involving inherently hazardous substances may increase marijuana products sales. No estimate of the 
potential increase in General Fund and Local Government Fund revenues as a result of increased sales tax collections 
is made at this time.
