18 of a wind energy development's generating facilities are located within 12 miles of a 
19 scenic resource of state or national significance. It also requires all rules adopted under 
20 the laws regarding expedited permitting of grid-scale wind energy development on or

Current biennium cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Ai1y additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) from requiring a visual impact assessment 
(VIA) from an expedited wind energy development located within 12 miles of a scenic resource of state or national 
significance are anticipated to be minor and can be.absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The requirement 
that any rules enacted with regard to expedited wind pennitting be defined as major substantive rnles will increase 
DEP rulemaking costs.
