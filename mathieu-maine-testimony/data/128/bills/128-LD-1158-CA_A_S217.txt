reached, the Commissioner of Education may not accept further registrations from the 
commission until the provision is repealed on July 1, 2022. The amendment provides 
that, once the 10-school limit is reached, the commission may approve no more than one

This change does not affect the authority under current law for local school boards and 
collaboratives of local school boards to approve charters until the end of the 10-year

Redistribution of state subsidy -local school administrative units 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Allowing for one additional charter school per year to be approved during the remainder of the 10-year transition 
period, once the current limit of 10 public charter schools is met, will result in a redistribution of state subsidy away 
from local school administrative units and to the new public charter school. The impact on individual school 
administrative units will depend on the number of new public charter schools established and the number of students 
that choose to leave their current school to attend the new public charter school.
