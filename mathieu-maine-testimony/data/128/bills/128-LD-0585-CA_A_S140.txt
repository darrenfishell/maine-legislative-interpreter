128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 200, L.D. 585, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
Cash Qualifying Contributions under the Maine Clean Election Act" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 2. 21-A MRSA §1125, sub-§3-B is enacted to read: 
3-B. Optional reporting method for cash contributions. A participating candidate 
who collects qualifying contributions in cash may choose an alternative method of 
submitting those contributions to the Maine Clean Election Fund rather than submitting 
the qualifying contributions as prescribed in subsection 3. If a participating candidate 
chooses to submit qualifying contributions in accordance with this subsection, the 
following requirements must be met. 
A. Each qualifying contribution must be made voluntarily by the contributor from 
the contributor's personal funds. It is a violation of this chapter for a person to 
provide money to a contributor to pay for a qualifying contribution or to give 
anything of value to the contributor in exchange for a qualifying contribution. 
B. A contributor making a qualifying contribution in cash shall sign a form prepared 
by the commission for the purpose of documenting cash contributions. A candidate 
receiving qualifying contributions in cash shall submit the contributions to the 
commission in the aggregate in the form of a cashier's check or money order payable 
to the Maine Clean Election Fund. The candidate may not deposit qualifying 
contributions received in cash into the candidate's campaign account.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment establishes an alternative method for collecting and submitting 
qualifying cash contributions collected by a paiticipating candidate under the Maine 
Clean Election Act. The bill provides that a cash qualifying contribution is valid if the 
contributor signed a receipt and acknowledgment form. The amendment instead allows 
for qualifying contributions to be submitted in the manner prescribed in current law, 
which requires use of a money order, and adds that a cashier's check may also be used.
