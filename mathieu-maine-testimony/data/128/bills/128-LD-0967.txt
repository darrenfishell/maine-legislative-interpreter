 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the people of the State expect and need to ensure that high -quality care is 3 
provided in co mmunity -based care settings for vulnerable persons with intellectual 4 
disabilities or autism; and  5 
Whereas, reimbursement rates paid for community -based services for persons with 6 
intellectual disabilities or autism have been reduced by 12% relative to rates established 7 
in 2007, while the federal Consumer Price Index medical care services index has 8 
increased by 17% since 2007; and  9 
Whereas, the capacity of community -based providers to serve persons with 10 
intellectual disabilities or autism has been impaired by d eclining reimbursement rates and 11 
increased costs beyond the control of those providers; and  12 
Whereas, in order to provide high -quality care to persons with intellectual 13 
disabilities or autism, the Legislature must take prompt action to correct chronic 14 
under funding and to ensure the continued viability of these providers; and  15 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 16 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 17 
immediately necessar y for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 18 
therefore,  19
