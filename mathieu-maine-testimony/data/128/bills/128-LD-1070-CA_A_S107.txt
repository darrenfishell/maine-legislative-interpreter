Fiscal Note 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
This resolve requires the Department of Health and Human Services to submit a request to the United States 
Department of Agriculture to waive the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits time limit for able-
. bodied adults without dependents in areas designated as labor surplus areas by the United States Department of Labor, 
Employment and Training Administration. If this waiver is accepted, the change would necessitate modifications to 
the Automated Client Eligibility System, which would incur Office oflnformation Technology costs for testing and 
implementation. These contingent costs are estimated to be $24,567, with 50%, or $12,284, being an appropriation 
from the General Fund and 50% being an allocation to the Federal Expenditures Fund.
