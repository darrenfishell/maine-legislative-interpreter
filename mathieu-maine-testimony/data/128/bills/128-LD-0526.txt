 SUMMARY  1 
Current law requires the State to pay 45% of a retired teacher's share of the premium 2 
for group accident and sickness or health insurance.  This bill raises that percentage to 3 
50% from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019; 55% from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021; and 4 
60% after June 30, 2021.  It also removes the cap on the increase in the State's total cost 5 
for retired teachers' health insurance premiums for fiscal years ending after June 30, 6 
2015.  7
