 §4731.  Application  1 
The provisions of this Act apply notwithstanding any provision of law to the 2 
contrary, except to the extent the provision of law contains additional limitations on the 3 
consideration of criminal history information of applicants for employment.  4 
SUMMARY  5 
This bill enacts the Maine Fair Chance Employment Act and adds restrictions to the 6 
use of criminal history information in the context  of employment decisions by private 7 
employers and the State and its political subdivisions and of licensing decisions by 8 
licensing agencies.  9 
It prohibits an employer from asking an applicant for employment to disclose 10 
information concerning the applicant's  criminal history, or considering such information, 11 
until after the applicant has received a conditional offer of employment.  It restricts the 12 
way a private employer, or the State and its political subdivisions, may use criminal 13 
history information in the  course of making employment decisions and adds similar 14 
restrictions to the existing restrictions applicable to licensing agencies' consideration of 15 
criminal history information.  It also makes certain criminal history information in the 16 
possession of the State and its political subdivisions confidential and makes all criminal 17 
background check information obtained by the State in connection with an employment 18 
decision confidential.  19 
The Maine Human Rights Commission is charged with enforcement of the Maine 20 
Fair Chance Employment Act and may seek civil penalties against a private employer for 21 
a violation of $1,000 for the first violation and $2,000 for each subsequent violation.  22 
The bill also creates a private right of action that may be brought by an affected  23 
individual against a private employer that has violated the Maine Fair Chance 24 
Employment Act and, upon prevailing, the affected individual is entitled to such legal or 25 
equitable relief as the court may determine appropriate and reasonable attorney's fees and 26 
costs.  27
