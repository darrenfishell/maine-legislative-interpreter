Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment requires enactment of legislation by the Legislature to close a state correctional facility. If such 
approval is forthcoming in a timely manner there will be no impact from this amendment. To the extent that this 
amendment delays or prevents the closure of a state correctional facility, any savings from closure and any costs from 
the selected alternative accommodation of inmates would be delayed or eliminated. The actual net fiscal impact will 
depend on the costs of the alternative chosen and cannot be estimated at this time.
