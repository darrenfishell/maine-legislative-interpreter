SUMMARY 
This amendment allows the Department of Marine Resources to charge the holder of 
an elver fishing license an annual fee not to exceed $35 for an elver transaction card. The 
amendment allows an applicant to the elver fishing license lotte1y to submit up to 5 
applications per lottery year. The amendment removes the requirement in the bill that the 
Commissioner of Marine Resources hold an elver fishing license lottery each year. The 
amendment removes the provision of the bill that allocates at least 4 pounds of elver 
fishing quota to each license holder. The amendment increases the fees for all elver 
fishing licenses. The amendment removes the provision in the bill that requires rules 
regarding elver fishing quotas to provide a method for redistributing quota that will not be 
fished; that authority exists in current law. The amendment defines 11bulk pile" for the 
purposes of the law on the seizure of illegally harvested elvers as all elvers in the 
possession of a harvester or dealer who fished for, took, bought or possesses elvers in 
violation of any law or rule regulating elvers. The amendment removes the requirement 
in the bill that the commissioner issue 425 elver fishing licenses each year and instead 
allows the commissioner to issue up to 425 licenses. The amendment adds an 
appropriations and allocations section.

The bill would allow the Depatiment of Marine Resources (DMR) the option of reinstating a lottery system for elver 
fishing licenses. The bill also increases the surcharge on elver licenses issued and the fee charged for electronic swipe 
cards. These changes are expected to increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue by $192,500 annually beginning 
in fiscal year 2017-18. This estimate was made using the following assumptions: The DMR will start holding a 
lottery in fiscal year 2017-18. This lottery will have approximately 4,000 entries at $35 each, generating $140,000 in 
revenue, of which $100,000 will be credited to the Eel and Elver Management Fund (EEMF) and $40,000 will be 
retained by the DMR for administrative costs. The DMR will issue 1000 swipe cards at $35 each, an increase of$10 
over the current $25, generating an additional $10,000 in EEMF revenue. The DMR will issue 425 resident elver 
licenses at $100 each, generating $42,500 in EEMF revenue.
