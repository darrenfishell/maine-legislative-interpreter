 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §17001, sub -§13, ¶C, as repealed and replaced by PL 1999, c. 2 
489, §2, is amended to read:  3 
C.  The following provisions govern limitations on earnable compensation.  4 
(1)  Notwithst anding the other provisions of this subsection, for the purposes of 5 
determining average final compensation, "earnable compensation" does not 6 
include any increase that exceeds the prior year's earnable compensation by more 7 
than 5% or that results in a total  increase of more than 10% during the 3 -year 8 
period used in the calculation of average final compensation, unless the cost of 9 
the additional actuarial liability arising from the excess increase is paid by the 10 
employer as provided in section 17154.  Any pay ment made under paragraph B, 11 
subparagraph (1) must be included in determining the amount of increase in the 12 
year in which the payment is made.  This subparagraph does not apply to excess 13 
increases resulting from compensation paid prior to July 1, 1993, fro m 14 
compensation paid in accordance with an individual employment contract 15 
executed prior to July 1, 1993 or a collective bargaining agreement executed or 16 
ratified in its final form by final vote of one party to the agreement prior to July 17 
1, 1993 for the in itial term of that contract or agreement or from other action by 18 
the governing body of a school administrative unit in effect on July 1, 1993.  This 19 
subparagraph does not apply to increases in compensation of state employees 20 
during fiscal year 1993 -94 and fiscal year 1994 -95.  In all circumstances in which 21 
this subparagraph does not apply to earnable compensation of state employees 22 
and teachers, the provisions of this subparagraph that were in effect prior to June 23 
30, 1993 apply.  This subparagraph does not  apply to earnable compensation of 24 
employees of participating local districts.  25 
(2)  Effective October 1, 1999, the 5% limitation and the 10% limitation on 26 
increases in earnable compensation set out in subparagraph (1) may not be 27 
changed to a lower percenta ge for members who, on October 1, 1999 or 28 
thereafter, meet the creditable service requirement for eligibility to receive a 29 
service retirement benefit, at the applicable age if so required, under section 30 
17851 or section 17851 -A, subsection 2.  31 
(3)  If, duri ng any year, an employee receives payment for compensation earned 32 
in a prior year or years, earnable compensation must be calculated according to 33 
this subparagraph. The portion of the employee's compensation that is 34 
retrospective payment for compensation e arned in a prior year or years must be 35 
deducted from earnable compensation for the year in which it is paid and must be 36 
added to earnable compensation for the prior year or years in which that 37 
compensation was earned.  38 
SUMMARY  39 
This bill amends the definitio n of "earnable compensation" for the purposes of the 40 
state retirement system.  The bill provides that if, during any year, an employee receives 41 
retrospective payment for compensation earned in a prior year or years, the portion of the 42 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0333(01) -1 
 employee's compensati on that is retrospective payment for compensation earned in a 1 
prior year or years must be deducted from earnable compensation for the year in which it 2 
is paid and must be added to earnable compensation for the prior year or years in which 3 
that compensation  was earned.  4
