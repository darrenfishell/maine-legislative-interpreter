This bill changes the name of the Telecommunications Relay Services Advisory Council to the Telecommunications 
Relay Services Council (TRSC). Currently, TRSC members are not authorized to receive compensation or 
reimbursement for expenses. This bill authorizes reimbursement for member expenses and the cost of holding public 
meetings. The bill also requires the PUC to forward the annual budget amount requested by the TRSC, now capped at 
$600,000, to the TRSC in quarterly installments without changing the amount requested. Funding is from the Maine 
Universal Service Fund, just as it is under cunent law and will be credited to the newly created Telecommunications 
Relay Services Council Fund. The bill includes allocations to the TRSC of $150,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 
$600,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. Finally, the bill grants an exemption to the TRSC from certain state purchasing rules 
related to competitive bidding.
