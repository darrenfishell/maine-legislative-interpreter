SUMMARY  33 
This bill allows a sheriff, local law enforcement officer or animal control officer to 34 
determine whether a dog is a dangerous dog and requires the court to take that 35 
determination into account when making a decision regarding a dangerous dog.  It 36 
requires the sheriff, local law enforcement officer or animal control officer who 37 
determines a dog to be dangerous to ap ply for an ex parte order to take possession of the 38 
dog.  It removes the option of the court's allowing the owner or keeper of a dangerous dog 39 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0283(01) -1 
 to keep the dog and requires the court either to order the dog confined at a governmental 1 
facility or at a local humane society or similar nongovernmental organization or to order 2 
the dog euthanized.  It also adds to the law regarding ordering a dog's euthanasia that the 3 
dog must be euthanized if it killed, maimed or inflicted serious bodily injury upon a 4 
domesticate d animal.  5
