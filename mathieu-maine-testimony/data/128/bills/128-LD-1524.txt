SUMMARY  40 
This bill amends the motor vehicle and traffic laws to:  41 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0775(01) -1 
 1.  Clarify the definition of the word "wrecker" to specify that it applies only when 1 
the vehicle is in the act of towing or carrying a vehicle or freeing a stuck vehicle;  2 
2.  Decriminalize certain provisions o f law regarding fuel tax licensing and reporting.  3 
Displaying a false fuel use identification decal remains a Class D crime;  4 
3.  Specify that the version of the federal regulations incorporated by reference into 5 
rules of the Department of Public Safety is the most current version as filed with the 6 
Secretary of State;  7 
4.  Increase the class of crime from a Class E to a Class D crime for operating, or 8 
permitting the operation of, a motor vehicle without proof of financial responsibility and 9 
to a Class C crime  if death or serious bodily injury results from an accident involving that 10 
motor vehicle;  11 
5.  Clarify that the exemption from inspection requirements for antique autos applies 12

6.  Require a truck tracto r owner or operator to display on both sides of the truck 14

7.  Correct an error in the s tatute pertaining to splash guards to exempt a truck tractor 17 
from having splash guards when it is hauling a trailer or semitrailer;  18

law. 24
