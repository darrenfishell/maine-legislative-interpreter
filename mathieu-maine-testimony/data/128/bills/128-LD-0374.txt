402-A, subsection 1, paragraph A; or section 752 -A or 752 -C, or for an attempt of 16 
any such crime, or for engaging in substantially similar conduct in another 17 
jurisdiction, the sentencing class for the crime is one class higher than it would 18 
otherwise be.  19 
(1)  In the case of a Class A crime, the sentencing class is not elevated, but the 20 
prior record must be assigned special weight by the court when imposing a 21 
sentence.  22 
(2)  Section 9 -A governs the use of prior convictions when determining a 23 
sentence, except that, for the purposes of this paragraph, for violations under 24 
chapter 11, the dates of prior convictions may have occurred at any time.  25 
This paragraph does not apply to section 210 -A if the prior convictions have already 26 
served to elevate the  sentencing class under section 210 -A, subsection 1, paragraph C 27 
or E or any other offense in which prior convictions have already served to elevate 28 
the sentencing class.  29 
C.  The sentencing class for a crime that is pled and proved and is subject to elevat ion 30

 C.  In the case of sexual exploitation of a minor, the aggravating sentencing factor 1 
specified in section 282, subsection 3.  2 
7.  Special weight required for certain aggravating sentencing factors found 3 
present by court.   In exercising its sent encing discretion, the court shall assign special 4 
weight to the following aggravating sentencing factors if found by the court.  5 
A.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 6 
individual convicted of aggravated attempted mu rder, attempted murder, 7 
manslaughter, elevated aggravated assault or aggravated assault of a child who had 8 
not in fact attained 6 years of age at the time the crime was committed, the court shall 9 
assign special weight to this objective fact in determining the basic term of 10 
imprisonment as the first step in the sentencing process specified in section 1602, 11 
subsection 1, paragraph A.  The court shall assign special weight to any subjective 12 
victim impact in determining the maximum period of incarceration in th e 2nd step in 13 
the sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph B.  The 14 
court may not suspend that portion of the maximum term of imprisonment based on 15 
objective or subjective victim impact in arriving at the final sentence as the 3 rd and 16 
final step in the sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph 17 
C.  This paragraph may not be construed to restrict a court in setting a sentence from 18 
considering the age of the victim in other circumstances when relevant.  19 
B.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 20 
individual convicted of aggravated attempted murder, attempted murder, 21

term of imprisonment based on objective or subjective victim impact in arriving at 30 
the final sentence as the 3rd and final step in the sentencing process specified in 31 
section 1602, subsection 1, paragra ph C.  This paragraph may not be construed to 32 
restrict a court in setting a sentence from considering the fact that the victim was 33 
pregnant in other circumstances when relevant.  34 
C.  In imposing a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 35 
individual convicted of a Class C or higher crime, the victim of which was at the time 36

crime pursuant to section 1804, or a period of administrative release, which may not 8 
exceed one year . 9 
ยง1606.  General inapplicability of deductions under chapter 81 in setting the term of 10 
imprisonment  11 
If a court imposes a sentencing alternative pursuant to section 1502 that includes a 12 
term of imprisonment, in setting the appropriate length of that term, as well as an 13 
unsuspended portion of that term, if any, the court may not consider the potential impact 14 
of deductions under chapter 81 except in the context of a plea agreement in which both 15 
parties are recommending to the court a particular disposition un der the Maine Rules of 16 
Unified Criminal Procedure, Rule 11 -A. 17 
ยง1607.  Prohibition against imprisonment based on incapacity to pay fine  18 
If a court finds that an individual has met the burden of proving incapacity to pay a 19 
fine pursuant to section 1702, subs ection 2, the court may not impose a term of 20 
imprisonment or any other sentencing alternative involving imprisonment solely for the 21 
reason that the individual does not have the present or future capacity to pay the fine.  22 
ยง1608.  Multiple sentences of impri sonment  23 
1.  Court to state whether sentence is served concurrently or consecutively; 24 
consecutive sentence contingent upon certain factors.   The court shall state in the 25 
sentence of imprisonment whether a sentence must be served concurrently with or 26 
consecu tively to any other sentence previously imposed or to another sentence imposed 27 
on the same date. The sentences must be concurrent except that the court may impose the 28 
sentences consecutively after considering the following factors:  29 
A.  The convictions are for offenses based on different conduct or arising from 30 
different criminal episodes;  31 
B.  The individual was under a previously imposed suspended or unsuspended 32 
sentence and was on probation or administrative release, under incarceration or on a 33 
release pro gram or period of supervised release at the time the individual committed a 34 
subsequent offense;  35 
C.  The individual had been released on bail when that individual committed a 36 
subsequent offense, either pending trial of a previously committed offense or pend ing 37 
the appeal of previous conviction; or  38 
D.  The seriousness of the criminal conduct involved in either a single criminal 39 
episode or in multiple criminal episodes or the seriousness of the criminal record of 40 
 
 Page 11 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 the individual, or both, require a sentence of imprisonment in excess of the maximum 1 
available for the most serious offense.  2 
2.  Limitations on imposition of consecutive terms for crimes in same criminal 3 
episode.   An individual may not be sentenced to consecutive terms for crimes arising out 4 
of the sam e criminal episode if:  5 
A.  One crime is an included crime of the other;  6 
B.  One crime consists only of a conspiracy, attempt, solicitation or other form of 7 
preparation to commit, or facilitation of, the other;  8 
C.  The crimes differ only in that one is defi ned to prohibit a designated kind of 9 
conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of that conduct; or  10 
D.  Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the 11 
crimes.  12 
3.  Reason for consecutive sentences must be stated.   If the court decides to impose 13 
consecutive sentences, the court shall state its reasons for doing so on the record or in the 14 
sentences.  15 
4.  When new sentence is to be served consecutively for individual on probation 16 
or administrative release.   If an individual has been placed on probation or 17 
administrative release pursuant to a previously imposed sentence and the court 18 
determines that the previously imposed sentence and a new sentence must be served 19 
consecutively, the court shall revoke probation o r administrative release pursuant to 20 
section 1812, subsections 5 and 6.  The court may order that the sentence that had been 21 
suspended be served at the same institution as that which is specified by the new 22 
sentence.  23 
5.  Mandatory resentencing following di scovery of previously imposed sentence.   24 
If it is discovered subsequent to the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment that the 25 
sentencing court was unaware of a previously imposed sentence of imprisonment that is 26 
not fully discharged, the court shall res entence the individual and shall specify whether 27 
the sentences are to be served concurrently or consecutively.  28 
6.  Special requirements for individual previously sentenced in another 29 
jurisdiction.   If an individual who has been previously sentenced in anot her jurisdiction 30 
has not commenced or completed that sentence, the court may, with consideration of the 31 
factors stated in subsection 1, sentence the individual to a term of imprisonment that must 32 
be treated as a concurrent sentence from the date of sentenc ing although the individual is 33 
incarcerated in an institution of the other jurisdiction.  A concurrent sentence pursuant to 34 
this subsection may not be imposed unless the individual being sentenced consents or 35 
unless the individual being sentenced executes,  at the time of sentencing, a written waiver 36 
of extradition for that individual's return to this State, upon completion of the sentence of 37 
the other jurisdiction, if any portion of this State's sentence remains unserved.  In the 38 
absence of an order pursuan t to this subsection requiring concurrent sentences, any 39 
sentence of imprisonment in this State commences as provided in section 2303, 40 
subsections 1 and 2 and runs consecutively to the sentence of the other jurisdiction.  41 
 
 Page 12 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 7.  Sentencing subsequent to probat ion, administrative release or supervised 1 
release.   A court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment, not wholly suspended, to 2 
be served consecutively to any split sentence, or to any sentence including supervised 3 
release under chapter 67, subchapter 3, p reviously imposed or imposed on the same date, 4 
if the net result, even with the options made available by subsections 4 and 8 and section 5 
1804, subsection 12, would be to have the individual released from physical confinement 6 
to be on probation, administra tive release or supervised release for the first sentence and 7 
thereafter be required to serve an unsuspended term of imprisonment on the 2nd sentence.  8 
8.  Rearrangement of order of sentences.   A court imposing a sentence of 9 
imprisonment to be served consec utively to any other previously imposed sentence that 10 
the individual has not yet commenced, in order to comply with subsection 7, may 11 
rearrange the order in which the sentences are to be served.  12 
ยง1609.  Nonconcurrent sentence for crime attempted or committ ed while in 13 
execution of term of imprisonment  14 
Notwithstanding section 1608, when an individual subject to an undischarged term of 15 
imprisonment is convicted of a crime committed while in execution of any term of 16 
imprisonment or of an attempt to commit a cri me while in execution of any term of 17 
imprisonment, the sentence is not concurrent with any undischarged term of 18 
imprisonment.  The court may order that any undischarged term of imprisonment be 19 
tolled and service of the nonconcurrent sentence commence immed iately and the court 20 
shall so order if any undischarged term of imprisonment is a split sentence.  No portion of 21 
the nonconcurrent sentence may be suspended.  Any sentence that the convicted 22 
individual receives as a result of the conviction of a crime or a ttempt to commit a crime 23 
while in execution of a term of imprisonment must be nonconcurrent with all other 24 
sentences.  25 
This section applies to prisoners on supervised community confinement pursuant to 26 
Title 34 -A, section 3036 -A. 27 
ยง1610.  Place of imprisonmen t 28 
1.  Class D or Class E crimes.   The court shall specify a county jail as the place of 29 
imprisonment for an individual convicted of a Class D or Class E crime, except that, if a 30 
sentence to a term of imprisonment in a county jail is consecutive to or is to  be followed 31 
by a sentence to a term of imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections, 32 
the court imposing either sentence may order that both be served in the custody of the 33 
Department of Corrections.  If a court imposes consecutive terms of  imprisonment for 34 
Class D or Class E crimes and the aggregate length of the terms imposed is one year or 35 
more, the court may order that they be served in the custody of the Department of 36 
Corrections.  37 
2.  Class A, Class B or Class C crimes.   For an individu al convicted of a Class A, 38 
Class B or Class C crime the court shall:  39 
A.  Specify a county jail as the place of imprisonment if the term of imprisonment is 40 
9 months or less; or  41 
 
 Page 13 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 B.  Commit the individual to the Department of Corrections if the term of 1 
impris onment is more than 9 months.  2 
3.  Intermittent service of county jail sentence.   At the request of or with the 3 
consent of a convicted individual, the court may order a sentence of imprisonment under 4 
this chapter in a county jail, a sentence of probation in volving imprisonment in a county 5 
jail under chapter 67, subchapter 1 or a sentence of administrative release under chapter 6 
67, subchapter 2 to be served intermittently.  7 
ยง1611.  Commitments to Department of Corrections of bound -over juveniles who 8 
have not a ttained 18 years of age at the time of sentencing  9 
A juvenile who has been bound over, pursuant to Title 15, section 3101, subsection 4, 10 
who is subsequently, as to the juvenile crime's adult counterpart, convicted and sentenced 11 
to a sentencing alternative i nvolving imprisonment and who has not attained 18 years of 12 
age at the time of sentence imposition must be committed to a Department of Corrections 13 
juvenile correctional facility for an indeterminate period not to extend beyond the 14 
juvenile's 18th birthday to serve the term of imprisonment or any unsuspended portion 15 
until discharge from the juvenile correctional facility, and once discharged the juvenile 16 
must be transferred to a correctional facility in which adult individuals are confined to 17 
serve out the r emainder of the imprisonment term or unsuspended portion, if any.  18 
ยง1612.  Tolling of sentence of noncompliant witness  19 
In the event a witness in a grand jury or criminal proceeding has been ordered 20 
confined by a court in the State as a remedial coercive san ction for refusing to comply 21 
with an order of the court to testify or provide evidence, and that witness is already in 22 
execution of an undischarged term of imprisonment on a sentence in the State, that court 23 
may order that the undischarged term of imprison ment be tolled for the duration of the 24 
coercive imprisonment.  25 
CHAPTER 65  26 
FINES, FEES, ASSESSM ENTS AND SURCHARGES  27 
SUBCHAPTER 1  28 
FINES  29 
ยง1701.  Definite fine amount required  30 
In imposing a sentencing alternative pursuant to section 1502 that includes a fine, th e 31 
court shall set a specific amount of money.  32 
ยง1702.  Criteria for imposing sentencing alternative that includes fine  33 
1.  Consideration of financial capacity to pay and financial burden.   In 34 
determining the amount of a fine, unless the fine amount is manda tory, and in 35 
determining the method of payment of a fine, the court shall take into account the present 36 
and future financial capacity of the convicted person to pay the fine and the nature of the 37 
 
 Page 14 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 financial burden that payment of the fine will impose on the  person or a dependent, if 1 
any, of the person.  2 
2.  Burden of proving financial hardship or incapacity to pay.   A convicted 3 
person who asserts a present or future incapacity to pay a fine or asserts that the fine will 4 
cause an excessive financial hardship o n the person or on a dependent of the person has 5 
the burden of proving the incapacity or excessive hardship by a preponderance of the 6 
evidence.  On appeal of a sentencing alternative involving a fine, the person has the 7 
burden of demonstrating that the inc apacity or excessive financial hardship was proven as 8 
a matter of law.  9 
ยง1703.  Use of fine relative to individuals  10 
Except when specifically precluded, in choosing the appropriate punishment for an 11 
individual convicted of a crime, the court shall consider t he desirability of imposing a 12 
sentencing alternative involving a fine either in conjunction with or in lieu of a sentencing 13 
alternative involving imprisonment.  A sentencing alternative involving imprisonment 14 
may not be imposed by a court solely for the re ason that the individual does not have the 15 
present or future financial capacity to pay a fine.  16 
ยง1704.  Maximum fine amounts authorized for convicted individuals  17 
An individual who has been convicted of a Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D or 18 
Class E crime m ay be sentenced to pay a fine.  Except as provided in section 1706 and 19 
unless a different maximum fine is specified by statute, the maximum fine that may be 20 
imposed by a court on a convicted individual is as follows : 21 
1.  Class A crime.   In the case of a Cl ass A crime, $50,000;  22 
2.  Class B crime.   In the case of a Class B crime, $20,000;  23 
3.  Class C crime.   In the case of a Class C crime, $5,000;  24 
4.  Class D crime.   In the case of a Class D crime, $2,000; and  25 
5.  Class E crime.   In the case of a Class E crim e, $1,000.  26 
ยง1705.  Maximum fine amounts authorized for convicted organizations  27 
An organization that has been convicted of murder or a Class A, Class B, Class C, 28 
Class D or Class E crime may be sentenced to pay a fine.  Except as provided in section 29 
1706 an d unless a different maximum fine is specified by statute, the maximum fine that 30 
may be imposed by a court on a convicted organization is as follows : 31 
1.  Crime of murder.   In the case of the crime of murder, any amount;  32 
2.  Class A crime.   In the case of a  Class A crime, $100,000;  33 
3.  Class B crime.   In the case of a Class B crime, $40,000;  34 
4.  Class C crime.   In the case of a Class C crime, $20,000; and  35 
 
 Page 15 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 5.  Class D crime or Class E crime.   In the case of a Class D crime or a Class E 1 
crime, $10,000.  2 
ยง1706.  Exceptions to maximum fine amounts  3 
Notwithstanding the maximum fine amounts specified in sections 1704 and 1705, a 4 
court may impose fines as provided in this section.  5 
1.  Pecuniary gain.   Regardless of the classification of the crime, the court may 6 
impose  a fine on a convicted person that is in an amount greater than the maximum fine 7 
amounts specified in section 1704 for an individual and section 1705 for an organization 8 
as long as the fine does not exceed twice the pecuniary gain derived from the crime by  9 
the convicted person.  The State must plead and prove the amount of money or the value 10 
of the property obtained by the person at the time of the commission of the crime.  At 11 
sentencing, if the court is considering imposing a fine based upon pecuniary gain , it shall 12 
hold a hearing in order to determine the pecuniary gain.  At the hearing the court shall 13 
determine whether any money or property was returned to the victim of the crime or was 14 
seized by or surrendered to a lawful authority prior to the time of s entencing, and shall 15 
determine the value of any such property.  If the court finds that money or property was 16 
returned, seized or surrendered, the court shall reduce the pecuniary gain pleaded and 17 
proved by the State at trial by the amount of money or the value of property returned, 18 
seized or surrendered in order to arrive at the net amount of pecuniary gain upon which a 19 
fine may be based pursuant to this subsection.  If the court determines that no money or 20 
property was returned, seized or surrendered, the  court shall base the fine on the amount 21 
pleaded and proved by the State.  22 
As used in this subsection, "pecuniary gain" means the amount of money or the value of 23 
property at the time of the commission of the crime derived by the person from the 24 
commission o f the crime.  25 
2.  Fine based on quantity of item illegally possessed by convicted person.   26 
Whenever a statute makes the possession of a particular item, whether animate or 27 
inanimate, a criminal offense and provides that the amount of the fine depends upon t he 28 
quantity of the item possessed by the person, if the State pleads and proves the quantity of 29 
the item possessed by the person, the fine is as provided for in the statute and is not 30 
subject to the maximum limits placed on fines by sections 1704 and 1705.  31 
3.  Fine based on value of scheduled drug at time of offense.   Whenever a statute 32 
authorizes that the amount of the fine for a specific drug offense be based on the value of 33 
the scheduled drug at the time of the offense upon which the conviction is based,  if the 34 
State pleads and proves the value of the scheduled drug at the time of the offense, the fine 35 
may be as provided for in the statute and is not subject to the maximum limits placed on 36 
fines by sections 1704 and 1705.  37 
ยง1707.  Multiple fines imposed o n convicted person  38 
When multiple fines are imposed on a convicted person at the same time or when a 39 
fine is imposed on a convicted person already subject to an unpaid or partly unpaid fine, 40 
the fines must be cumulative, unless the court specifies that only  the highest single fine 41 
 
 Page 16 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 must be paid in the case of offenses based on the same conduct or arising out of the same 1 
criminal episode or for other good cause stated on the record or in the sentences.  2 
ยง1708.  Time and method of payment of fines imposed on con victed person  3 
1.  Timing of fine payment.   If a convicted person is sentenced to pay a fine, the 4 
court may grant permission for the payment to be made within a specified period of time 5 
or in specified installments. If  such permission is not included in th e sentence, the fine 6 
must be paid immediately to the clerk of the court.  7 
2.  Payment as condition of probation or administrative release.   If a convicted 8 
person sentenced to pay a fine is also placed on probation or administrative release, the 9 
court may ma ke the payment of the fine a condition of probation or administrative 10 
release.  In the case of probation, the court may order that the fine be paid to the 11 
convicted person's probation officer.  12 
ยง1709.  Post -conviction relief invalidating conviction; potenti al return of fine 13 
payments  14 
If, in any judicial proceeding following conviction, a court issues a final judgment 15 
invalidating the conviction, the judgment may include an order that a fine payment or any 16 
part of a fine payment that the convicted person paid pursuant to the sentence for that 17 
conviction be returned to that person.  18 
ยง1710.  Modification of payment of fine  19 
If a convicted person who has been sentenced to pay a fine is in danger of default, 20 
that person shall move the court for a modification of time  or method of payment to avoid 21 
a default.  The court may modify its prior order to allow additional time for payment or to 22 
reduce the amount of each installment.  23 
ยง1711.  Default  24 
1.  Return to court upon default.   A convicted person who has been sentenced t o 25 
pay a fine and who fails to pay part or all of that fine is in default and must be returned to 26 
court to explain the failure to pay the fine.  27 
2.  Court authorized to conduct default hearing.   A convicted person who has 28 
defaulted on the payment of a fine a nd is required to be returned to a court pursuant to a 29 
warrant may be returned to the court that issued the warrant or to the court having 30 
jurisdiction over the area where the warrant was executed.  Either court is authorized to 31 
conduct the default hearing  pursuant to subsection 4.  32 
For purposes of this subsection, "convicted person" includes an individual or individuals 33 
authorized to make disbursements from the assets of a convicted organization.  34 
3.  Reporting of default; motion to revoke probation, revoke administrative 35 
release or enforce payment.  A probation officer having knowledge of a default in 36 
payment of a fine by a convicted person shall report the default to the office of the 37 
attorney for the State.  An attorney for the State having knowledge of a default in 38 
 
 Page 17 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 payment of a fine by a convicted person shall report the default to the court.  If the fine 1 
was a condition of probation, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce 2 
payment of the fine or, with the written consent of the probation o fficer, a motion to 3 
revoke probation under section 1811.  If the fine was a requirement of administrative 4 
release, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce payment of the fine or a 5 
motion to revoke administrative release under section 1855.  If the fine was not a 6 
condition of probation or a requirement of administrative release, the attorney for the 7 
State may file a motion to enforce payment of the fine.  8 
4.  Procedure for motion to enforce payment.   Either the attorney for the State or 9 
the co urt may initiate a motion to enforce payment of a fine.  Notification for the hearing 10 
on the motion must be sent by regular mail to the convicted person's last known address.  11 
If the person does not appear for the hearing after proper notification has been  sent, the 12 
court may issue a bench warrant. A court need not bring a motion to enforce payment of a 13 
fine nor notify the person by regular mail of the date of the hearing if at the time of 14 
sentence imposition the court's order to pay the fine and accompanyi ng warnings to the 15 
person comply with Title 14, section 3141, subsection 3 or 4; in this case, if the person 16 
fails to appear as directed by the court's fine order, the court may issue a bench warrant.  17 
A.  Unless the person shows by a preponderance of the e vidence that the default was 18 
not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or to a 19 
failure on the person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for 20 
the payment, the court shall find that the defaul t was unexcused and may:  21 
(1)  Commit the person to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 22 
the fine is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcused default 23 
must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 m onths.  A person 24 
committed for nonpayment of a fine is given credit toward the payment of the 25 
fine for each day of confinement that the person is in custody at the rate specified 26 
in the court's order, which may not be less than $25 or more than $100 of unp aid 27 
fine for each day of confinement.  The person is also given credit for each day 28 
that the person is detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this 29 
section.  A person is responsible for paying any fine remaining after receiving 30 
credi t for confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining fine is also 31 
governed by this section; or  32 
(2)  If the unexcused default relates to a fine imposed for a Class C, Class D or 33 
Class E crime, as authorized by this subchapter, order the person to pe rform a 34 
specified number of hours of community service work for the benefit of the State, 35 
a county, a municipality, a school administrative district or other public entity, a 36 
charitable institution or other entity approved by the court until all or a speci fied 37 
part of the fine is paid.  The number of hours of community service work must be 38 
specified in the court's order and the person must receive a credit against the 39 
unpaid fine at a rate equal to the current hourly minimum wage.  A person 40 
ordered to perfo rm community service work pursuant to this subparagraph is 41 
given credit toward the payment of the fine for each 8 -hour day of community 42 
service work performed.  The person is also given credit toward the payment of 43 
the fine for each day that the person is detained as a result of an arrest warrant 44 
issued pursuant to this section at a rate specified in the court's order that is up to 45 
 
 Page 18 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 $100 of unpaid fine per day of confinement.  A person who fails to complete the 1 
work in the manner ordered by the court must be  returned to the court to explain 2 
the failure.  A person is responsible for paying any fine remaining after receiving 3 
credit for any detention and for community service work performed.  A default 4 
on the remaining fine is also governed by this section.  5 
The Department of Corrections is not responsible for supervision of community 6 
service work performed pursuant to this subparagraph.  7 
B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the person additional 8 
time for payment, may reduce the amoun t of each installment or may permit the 9 
person to perform community service work at the rate authorized by paragraph A, 10 
subparagraph (2), supervised by the sheriff of the county in which the court that 11 
assessed the fine is located or by a community confine ment monitoring agency with 12 
which that sheriff has contracted under Title 30 -A, section 1659 -A. 13 
C.  If the court commits a person to the custody of the sheriff for nonpayment of a 14 
fine pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the court may authorize, at the time 15 
of its order only, participation of the person in a project under Title 30 -A, section 16 
1606 with the agreement of the sheriff of the county jail where the person is 17 
committed.  The person must be given credit according to Title 30 -A, section 1606, 18 
subsection 2.  19 
D.  The confinement ordered under paragraph A, subparagraph (1) must be 20 
nonconcurrent with any judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.  21 
5.  Levy of execution or other civil measures authorized; consequence of levy of 22 
execution .  Upon any default, the court may order execution to be levied and may order 23 
other measures authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments to be taken to 24 
collect the unpaid fine.  A levy of execution does not discharge a convicted person 25 
confined  to a county jail or performing community service work under subsection 4 for 26 
unexcused default until the full amount of the fine has been collected or credited.  27 
6.  Payment of fine imposed on organization; consequence of failure.   When a 28 
fine is imposed o n an organization, the individual or individuals authorized to make 29 
disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay the fine from the 30 
organization's assets.  Failure to do so may subject the individual or individuals to court 31 
action pursuant to  this section.  32 
ยง1712.  Deposit of certain fines in Maine Military Family Relief Fund  33 
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a person is convicted under 34 
section 354, subsection 2, paragraph A of theft by deception due to that person's 35 
intentional creation or reinforcement of a false impression that the person is a veteran or a 36 
member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a state military force, any fine 37 
imposed on that person by the court must be deposited in the Maine Military Family  38 
Relief Fund established in Title 37 -B, section 158.  39

 Page 19 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 ยง1751.  County jail reimbursement fee  1 
1.  Assessment of reimbursement fee.   When an individual is sentenced to 2 
incarceration in a county jail, the sentencing  court shall consider and may assess as part 3 
of the sentence a jail reimbursement fee, referred to in this section as "the reimbursement 4 
fee," to help defray the expenses of the individual's room and board.  5 
2.  Evidence.   The court, in determining whether a reimbursement fee as set out in 6 
subsection 1 is to be assessed and in establishing the amount of that fee, shall consider 7 
evidence relevant to the individual's ability to pay that fee, including, but not limited to, 8 
the factors set forth in section 2005,  subsection 2, paragraph D, subparagraphs (1) to (5).  9 
The court may not consider as evidence the following:  10 
A.  Joint ownership, if any, that the individual may have in real property;  11 
B.  Joint ownership, if any, that the individual may have in any assets , earnings or 12 
other sources of income; and  13 
C.  The income, assets, earnings or other property, both real and personal, owned by 14 
the individual's spouse or family.  15 
3.  Amount of reimbursement fee; collection.   After considering all relevant 16 
evidence on the issue of the individual's ability to pay under subsection 2, the court may 17 
enter, as part of its sentence, a reimbursement fee that must be paid by the individual for 18 
incarceration in the county jail.  The reimbursement fee may not exceed the cost of 19 
incar cerating the individual or $80 per day, whichever is less, and must bear a reasonable 20 
relationship to the individual's ability to pay.  Upon petition by the individual, the amount 21 
may be modified to reflect any changes in the financial status of the indivi dual.  22 
Any reimbursement fee assessed must be collected by the county treasurer of the county 23 
in which the individual is incarcerated, paid into the treasury of that county and credited 24 
to the county responsible for paying for the incarceration of the indiv idual.  25 
4.  Timing of fee payment.   If an individual is sentenced to pay a reimbursement fee, 26 
the court may allow the individual to pay the reimbursement fee within a specified time 27 
or in specified installments.  If such permission is not contained in the s entence, the 28 
reimbursement fee is payable immediately.  29 
5.  Default.   An individual who has been sentenced to pay a reimbursement fee and 30 
who fails to pay part or all of that fee is in default and must be returned to court to explain 31 
the failure to pay that  fee. 32 
A probation officer who knows of a default in payment of a reimbursement fee by an 33 
individual shall report the default to the office of the attorney for the State or the attorney 34 
for the county.  If the reimbursement fee was a condition of probation,  the attorney for the 35 
State or the attorney for the county may file a motion to enforce payment of the 36 
reimbursement fee or, with the written consent of the probation officer, the attorney for 37 
the State may file a motion to revoke probation under section 1 205.  If the reimbursement 38 
fee was a requirement of administrative release, the attorney for the State or the attorney 39 
for the county may file a motion to enforce payment of the reimbursement fee or the 40 
attorney for the State may file a motion to revoke ad ministrative release under section 41 
 
 Page 20 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 1855.  If the reimbursement fee was not a condition of probation or a requirement of 1 
administrative release, the attorney for the State or the attorney for the county may file a 2 
motion to enforce payment of the reimbursem ent fee.  3 
6.  Motion to enforce payment of reimbursement fee.   The attorney for the State, 4 
the attorney for the county or the court may initiate a motion to enforce payment of a 5 
reimbursement fee.  Notification for the hearing on the motion must be sent by regular 6 
mail to the individual's last known address.  If the individual does not appear for the 7 
hearing after proper notification has been sent, the court may issue a bench warrant.  8 
A.  Unless the individual shows by a preponderance of the evidence that th e default 9 
was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or 10 
to a failure on the individual's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds 11 
required to make payment, the court shall find that the default was unexc used and 12 
may commit the individual to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 13 
the reimbursement fee is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for 14 
unexcused default must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 15 
months.  An individual committed for nonpayment of a reimbursement fee is given 16 
credit toward the payment of a reimbursement fee for each day of confinement that 17 
the individual is in custody, at the rate specified in the court's order, which may not 18 
be less  than $25 or more than $100 of unpaid reimbursement fee for each day of 19 
confinement.  The individual is also given credit for each day that the individual has 20 
been detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this section.  An 21 
individual is responsible for paying any reimbursement fee remaining after receiving 22 
credit for confinement and detention.  23 
B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the individual 24 
additional time for payment or may reduce the amount of each installment.  25 
C.  The confinement ordered under this subsection must be nonconcurrent with any 26 
judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.  27 
ยง1752.  Supervision fee as condition of probation  28 
If a court imposes a sentencing alternative authorized under section 1502 that 29 
includes a period of probation, it must attach as a condition of probation that the 30 
convicted individual pay, through the Department of Corrections, a supervision fee 31 
imposed pursuant to section 1807, subsection 5 for the term of pr obation.  32 
ยง1753.  Electronic monitoring fee and substance testing fee as conditions of 33 
probation  34 
If a court imposes a sentencing alternative authorized under section 1502 that 35 
includes a period of probation, upon the request of the Department of Corrections , the 36 
court shall attach as a condition of probation an electronic monitoring fee, a substance 37 
testing fee or both, as governed by section 1807, subsection 6.  38

periodically leave jurisd iction  2

writing by the convicted individual's probation officer, the Department o f Corrections 5 
may impose on the individual applying for permission to leave either temporarily or 6 
periodically an application fee, as governed by section 1807, subsection 7.  7 
ยง1755.  Administrative supervision fee as nonmandatory requirement of 8 
administrati ve release  9 
If a court imposes a suspended sentence with administrative release pursuant to 10 
section 1853 and attaches requirements for the term of the administrative release, the 11 
court -imposed requirements of administrative release may include an administra tive 12 
supervision fee, as governed by section 1854, subsection 2, paragraph A.  13 
ยง1756.  Administrative supervision fee as nonmandatory requirement of deferred 14 
disposition  15 
If an individual consents to a deferred disposition pursuant to section 1901 and a 16 
court orders sentencing to be deferred and imposes requirements to be in effect during the 17 
period of deferment, the court -imposed deferment requirements may include an 18 
administrative supervision fee, as governed by sections 1902 and 1903.  19

probation and discharge the person at any ti me earlier than that provided in the sentence 29 
made pursuant to this section, if warranted by the conduct of the person.  A termination 30

subsection relieves the person on probation of any obligations imposed by the sentence of 33 
probation.  34 
11.  Justice or judge authorized to hear motions regarding probation.   A motion 35 
and hearing pursua nt to subsection 7, 8, 9 or 10 need not be before the justice or judge 36

and any justice or judge may hear a motion brought by the person on probation or the 38 
person's pro bation officer.  39 
12.  Any court authorized to terminate probation to prevent delay of consecutive 40 
term of imprisonment.   Any court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, 41 
may terminate a period of probation that would delay commencement of a co nsecutive 42

served and the remainder of which is to b e suspended, and accompany the suspension 7 
with a period of probation not to exceed the maximum period authorized for the crime.  8 
The period of probation commences on the date the individual is released from the 9 
unsuspended portion of the term of imprisonme nt, unless the court orders it to commence 10 
on an earlier date.  11 
A.  If the period of probation commences upon release of the individual from the 12 
unsuspended portion of the term of imprisonment, the court may revoke probation for 13 
any criminal conduct committ ed during that unsuspended portion of the term of 14 
imprisonment.  15 
B.  If execution of the sentence is stayed, the court may revoke probation for criminal 16 
conduct committed during the period of stay or for failure to report as ordered.  17 
C.  The court may revok e probation if, during any unsuspended portion of the term of 18 
imprisonment, an individual sentenced as a repeat sexual assault offender, pursuant to 19 
section 1804, subsection 4, refuses to actively participate in a sex offender treatment 20 
program in accordan ce with the expectations and judgment of the treatment 21 
providers, when requested to do so by the Department of Corrections.  22 
D.  As to both the suspended and unsuspended portions of the sentence, the place of 23 
imprisonment must be as follows.  24 
(1)  For a Clas s D or Class E crime, the court must specify a county jail as the 25 
place of imprisonment.  26 
(2)  For a Class A, Class B or Class C crime, the court must:  27

(b)  Commit the individual to the Department of Corrections for any portion 30 
of the sentence that is more than 9 months.  31 
2.  Applicability to prosecution of crime committed prior to September 23, 1983.   32

with the consent of the defendant, impose a sentence under subsection 1.  34 
ยง1806.  Wholly suspended term of imprisonment with probation  35 
Unless prohibited pursuant to section 1802, subsection 1, paragraphs A to F, t he court 36 
may sentence an individual to a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum term 37 
authorized for the crime, suspend the entire term of imprisonment and accompany the 38

 ยง1807.  Conditions of probation  1 
1.  Purpose of conditions.   If the court imposes a sentencing alternative under 2 
section 1502 that includes a period of prob ation, it shall attach conditions of probation, as 3 
authorized by this section, as it considers to be reasonable and appropriate to assist the 4 
person to lead a law -abiding life, including, without exception, a condition of probation 5 
that the person refrain from criminal conduct.  6 
2.  Specific conditions of probation authorized.   As a condition of probation, the 7 
court in its sentence may require the person to:  8 
A.  Support the person's dependents and to meet the person's family responsibilities;  9 
B.  Make restit ution pursuant to chapter 69 to each victim of the person's crime, or to 10 
the county where the offense is prosecuted if the identity of the victim cannot be 11 
ascertained or if the victim voluntarily refuses the restitution.  If the court orders as a 12 
conditio n of probation that the person forfeit and pay a specific amount of restitution, 13 
that order, as a matter of law, also constitutes the imposition of restitution pursuant to 14 
chapter 69 as a sentencing alternative and an additional order regarding restitution  is 15 
unnecessary;  16 
C.  Pursue and maintain approved employment or an approved occupation;  17 
D.  Undergo, as an outpatient, available medical or psychiatric treatment, or to enter 18 
and remain, as a voluntary patient, in a specified institution when required for that 19 
purpose. Failure to comply with this condition is considered only as a violation of 20 
probation and may not, in itself, authorize involuntary treatment or hospitalization.  21 
The court may not order and the State may not pay for the person to attend a bat terers' 22 
intervention program unless the program is certified under Title 19 -A, section 4014;  23 
E.  Pursue a prescribed secular course of study or vocational training;  24 
F.  Refrain from frequenting specified places or consorting with specified persons;  25 
G.  Refrain from possessing any firearm or other dangerous weapon;  26 
H.  Remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless permission to leave 27 
temporarily is granted in writing by the person's probation officer, and to notify the 28 
probation officer of any change i n the person's address or employment;  29 
I.  Refrain from drug abuse and use or excessive use of alcohol;  30 
J.  Report as directed to the court or the person's probation officer, to answer all 31 
reasonable inquiries by the probation officer and to permit the prob ation officer to 32 
visit at reasonable times at the person's home or elsewhere;  33 
K.  Pay any monetary penalty imposed by the court as part of the sentence;  34 
L.  Perform specified work for the benefit of the State, a county, a municipality, a 35 
school administrat ive district, other public entity or a charitable institution;  36 
M.   Participate in an electronic monitoring program, if available; or  37 
N.  Satisfy any conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the person or the 38 
public safety or security.  39 
 
 Page 28 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 3.  Opportunity to address court regarding probation conditions; written 1 
statement required.   The person must be given an opportunity to address the court on 2 
the conditions that are proposed to be attached and, after sentence, must be given a 3 
written statement s etting forth the particular conditions on which the person is released on 4 
probation.  5 
4.  Condition of probation that includes psychiatric treatment or mental health 6 
counseling; notice by court to Department of Health and Human Services.   Before 7 
imposing an y condition of psychiatric outpatient or inpatient treatment or mental health 8 
counseling, the court may request that a report be submitted by an agent of the 9 
Department of Health and Human Services who has been designated pursuant to Title 10 
34-B, section 12 20 for the purpose of assessing the appropriateness of psychiatric 11 
treatment or mental health counseling for the individual and the availability of this 12 
treatment or counseling.  Whether or not a report is requested, the court shall notify the 13 
designated a gent of the Department of Health and Human Services when any conditions 14 
of probation are imposed that include psychiatric outpatient or inpatient treatment or 15 
mental health counseling.  This notification must include the name and last known 16 
address of the individual placed on probation, the name and address of the attorney of 17 
record for that individual and the conditions of probation.  18 
5.  Supervision fee; determination of amount by court; failure to pay.   The court 19 
shall attach as a condition of probation t hat the person pay, through the Department of 20 
Corrections, a supervision fee of between $10 and $50 per month, as determined by the 21 
court, for the term of probation.  If the court does not set a supervision fee, the 22 
supervision fee is $10 per month.  Notwi thstanding the attachment of supervision fee 23 
conditions on more than one sentence, a person on probation on concurrent sentences is 24 
required to pay only one supervision fee.  In determining whether to set an amount higher 25 
than $10 per month, the court shal l take into account the financial resources of the person 26 
and the nature of the burden its payment imposes.  A person may not be sentenced to 27 
imprisonment without probation solely for the reason the person is not able to pay the fee.  28 
When a person on prob ation fails to pay the supervision fee, the court may revoke 29 
probation as specified in section 1812, unless the person shows that failure to pay was not 30 
attributable to a willful refusal to pay or to a failure on that person's part to make a good 31 
faith eff ort to obtain the funds required for the payment.  The court, if it determines that 32 
revocation of probation is not warranted, shall issue a judgment for the total amount of 33 
the fee and shall issue an order attaching a specified portion of money received by  or 34 
owed to the person on probation until the total amount of the fee has been paid.  If the 35 
person makes this showing, the court may allow additional time for payment within the 36 
remaining period of probation or reduce the size of the fee to no less than $ 10 per month, 37 
but may not revoke the requirement to pay the fee unless the remaining period of 38 
probation is 30 days or less.  39 
6.  Electronic monitoring and substance testing fees; determination of amount 40 
by court; failure to pay; use of fees.   Upon the requ est of the Department of 41 
Corrections, the court shall attach as a condition of probation that the person pay, through 42 
the department, an electronic monitoring fee, a substance testing fee or both, as 43 
determined by the court, for the term of probation.  In determining the amount of the fees, 44 
the court shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the 45 
 
 Page 29 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 burden the payment imposes.  A person may not be sentenced to imprisonment without 1 
probation solely for the reason the person is not able to pay the fees.  When a person on 2 
probation fails to pay the fees, the court may revoke probation as specified in section 3 
1812, unless the person shows that failure to pay was not attributable to a willful refusal 4 
to pay or to a failure on tha t person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds 5 
required for the payment.  The court, if it determines that revocation of probation is not 6 
warranted, shall issue a judgment for the total amount of the fees and shall issue an order 7 
attaching  a specified portion of money received by or owed to the person on probation 8 
until the total amount of the fees has been paid.  If the person makes this showing, the 9 
court may allow additional time for payment within the remaining period of probation or 10 
reduce the size of the fees, but may not revoke the requirement to pay the fees unless the 11 
remaining period of probation is 30 days or less.  Fees received from a person on 12 
probation must be deposited into the department's adult community corrections account , 13 
unless the department has required the person to pay fees directly to a provider of 14 
electronic monitoring, substance testing or other services.  Funds from the adult 15 
community corrections account do not lapse and must be used to defray costs associated 16 
with the purchase and operation of electronic monitoring and substance testing programs.  17 
7.  Condition of probation that includes staying within jurisdiction of court; 18 
application fee; use of fees.   Whenever the court requires as a condition of probation th at 19 
the person remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless permission to leave 20 
temporarily is granted in writing by the person's probation officer, the Department of 21 
Corrections may impose on a person applying for such permission an application fee of 22 
$25.  The department may impose on a person an additional fee of $25 per month if 23 
permission is sought and granted to leave the jurisdiction of the court on a periodic basis.  24 
Permission to leave may not be denied or withdrawn solely because the person is not able 25 
to pay the application fee or the additional fee.  When a person fails to pay a fee imposed 26 
under this subsection, the department may refuse to process the application or may 27 
withdraw permission to leave if the failure to pay is attributable to  the person's willful 28 
refusal to pay or to a failure on the person's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the 29 
funds required for the payment.  Fees received from a person pursuant to this subsection 30 
must be deposited into the department's adult commu nity corrections account, which does 31 
not lapse, and must be used to defray costs associated with processing the applications, 32 
including, but not limited to, the cost of materials, equipment, training for probation 33 
officers and administration, and for the d epartment's share of the costs of extraditing 34 
persons on probation who are fugitives from justice.  35 
ยง1808.  Community reparations boards  36 
1.  Persons required to appear before board.   If the court imposes a sentencing 37 
alternative that includes a period of pr obation, the court shall require as a condition of 38 
probation that the person appear before a community reparations board, referred to in this 39 
section as "the board," and abide by any requirement imposed by the board if:  40 
A.  The person has been sentenced to  a suspended term of imprisonment with 41 
probation or a split sentence of imprisonment with probation the initial portion of 42 
which must be served in a county jail under section 1805;  43

 B.  The person has not been convicted of a crime under chapter 11 or a crim e of 1 
domestic violence;  2 
C.  The Department of Corrections recommends that appearance before the board be 3 
required; and  4 
D.  The court finds no circumstance that makes appearance inappropriate.  5 
2.  Duties of person required to appear before board.   A person required to appear 6 
before a community reparations board shall:  7 
A.  Cooperate with the preparation of the intake report to be submitted to the board;  8 
B.  Appear before the board as directed by the person's probation officer; and  9 
C.  Cooperate with the board . 10 
3.  Powers of board.   The powers of a community reparations board are limited to 11 
requiring the person to:  12 
A.  Pay restitution in accordance with chapter 69;  13 
B.  Perform community service;  14 
C.  Complete a prescribed course of counseling or education;  15 
D.  Refrain from frequenting specified places or consorting with specified persons;  16 
E.  Comply with reparative sanctions other than restitution, including, but not limited 17 
to, writing an apology to the victim and fulfilling crime -impact education measures; 18 
and 19 
F.  Report to the board regarding compliance with the requirements of this 20 
subsection.  21 
4.  Time limit on requirement imposed by board.   A requirement imposed by a 22 
community reparations board may not extend longer than 6 months, except the 23 
requirement to pa y restitution.  24 
5.  Violation.   A person who fails to abide by the requirements of this section 25 
commits a violation of probation.  26 
ยง1809.  Commencement of probation revocation proceedings by arrest  27 
1.  Authority of probation officer.   If a probation officer has probable cause to 28 
believe that a person on probation has violated a condition of that person's probation, that 29 
officer may arrest the person or cause the person to be arrested for the alleged violation.  30 
If the probation officer cannot, with due dilige nce, locate the person, the officer shall file 31 
a written notice of this fact with the court that placed the person on probation.  Upon the 32 
filing of that written notice, the court shall issue a warrant for the arrest of that person.  33 
2.  Probable cause hear ing; timing; evidence.   A person arrested pursuant to 34 
subsection 1, with or without a warrant, must be given a probable cause hearing as soon 35 
as reasonably possible, but not later than on the 5th day after arrest, excluding Saturdays, 36 
Sundays and holidays.   A probable cause hearing is not given if, within the 5 -day period, 37 
 
 Page 31 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 the person is released from custody or is afforded an opportunity for a court hearing on 1 
the alleged violation.  A  probable cause hearing is not required if the person is charged 2 
with or  convicted of a new offense and is incarcerated as a result of the pending charge or 3 
conviction.  4 
A.  Whenever a person arrested pursuant to subsection 1 is entitled to a probable 5 
cause hearing pursuant to this subsection, unless the person waives the right  to the 6 
hearing, that hearing must be held at the initial appearance and may be held in the 7 
court located as near to the place where the violation is alleged to have taken place as 8 
is reasonable under the circumstances.  If it is alleged that the person vi olated 9 
probation because of the commission of a new offense, the probable cause hearing is 10 
limited to the issue of identification if probable cause on the new offense has already 11 
been found by the District Court or by the Superior Court or the person has b een 12 
indicted, has waived indictment or has been convicted.  13 
B.  Evidence presented to establish probable cause may include affidavits and other 14 
reliable hearsay evidence as permitted by the court.  15 
C.  If the court determines that there is not probable cause  to believe that the person 16 
has violated a condition of probation, the court shall order the person's release.  17 
3.  Failure to hold probable cause hearing within required time period.   If a 18 
probable cause hearing is not held as required by subsection 2 with in the time period 19 
specified in subsection 2, it is grounds for the person's release on personal recognizance 20 
pending further proceedings.  21 
ยง1810.  Commencement of probation revocation proceedings by summons  22 
1.  Authority of probation officer.   If a probati on officer has probable cause to 23 
believe that a person on probation has violated a condition of probation, that officer may 24 
deliver to that person, or cause to be delivered to that person, a summons ordering that 25 
person to appear for a court hearing on the  alleged violation.  26 
2.  Contents of summons; probation officer to file motion for revocation.   The 27 
summons delivered pursuant to subsection 1 must include the signature of the probation 28 
officer; a brief statement of the alleged violation; the time and plac e of the alleged 29 
violation; and the time, place and date the person is to appear in court or a statement that 30 
the court will notify the person of the time, place and date to appear.  As soon as practical 31 
after service of the summons, the probation officer shall file with the court a motion for 32 
revocation of probation that sets forth the facts underlying the alleged violation.  33 
3.  Initial appearance.   A person appearing on a motion to revoke probation 34 
pursuant to a summons must be given an initial appearance  as provided in section 1811, 35 
subsection 4.  36 
4.  Failure to appear.   If the person fails to appear in court after having been served 37 
with a summons, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.  After arrest, 38 
the person must be given a probab le cause hearing as provided in section 1809, 39 
subsection 2 and an initial appearance as provided in section 1811, subsection 3.  40 
 
 Page 32 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 ยง1811.  Initial proceedings on probation violation; filing of motion; initial 1 
appearance  2 
1.  Timing of motion for probation revo cation.   A motion for probation revocation, 3 
which first must be approved by the prosecuting attorney, must be filed within 3 days, 4 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of the arrest of a person on probation 5 
pursuant to section 1809.  6 
2.  Contents of m otion.   The motion must set forth the facts underlying the alleged 7 
violation and, unless the person is to be given a probable cause hearing at the initial 8 
appearance as provided in section 1809, must be accompanied by a copy of the summons 9 
delivered to the  person.  10 
3.  Timing of initial appearance on motion receipt; copy of motion to person on 11 
probation.   Upon receipt of a motion for revocation of probation with respect to a person 12 
arrested pursuant to section 1809 or section 1810, subsection 4 who is not so oner 13 
released, the court shall provide the person with an initial appearance on the revocation of 14 
probation within 5 days after the arrest, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  A 15 
copy of the motion must be furnished to the person prior to or at the initial appearance.  16 
4.  Procedure at initial appearance.   At the initial appearance, the court shall advise 17 
the person of the contents of the motion, the right to a hearing on the motion, the right to 18 
be represented by counsel at a hearing and the right to  appointed counsel.  If the person 19 
cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  The court shall ask 20 
the person to admit or deny the alleged violation.  If the person refuses to admit or deny, a 21 
denial must be entered.  In the cas e of a denial, the court shall set the motion for hearing 22 
and may commit the person, with or without bail, pending hearing.  If the person is 23 
committed without bail pending hearing, the date of the hearing must be set no later than 24 
45 days from the date of  the initial appearance unless otherwise ordered by the court.  25 
5.  Bail determination.   In deciding whether to set bail under this section and in 26 
setting the kind and amount of that bail, the court must be guided by the standards of 27 
post-conviction bail in  Title 15, section 1051, subsection 2.  Appeal is governed by Title 28 
15, section 1051, subsections 5 and 6.  Bail set under this section is also governed by the 29 
sureties and other forms of bail provisions in Title 15, chapter 105 -A, subchapter 4 and 30 
the enf orcement provisions in Title 15, chapter 105 -A, subchapter 5, articles 1 and 3, 31 
including the appeal provisions in Title 15, section 1099 -A, subsection 2.  32 
6.  Effect of failure to meet time limits.   Failure to comply with the time limits set 33 
forth in this section is not grounds for dismissal of a motion for probation revocation but 34 
may be grounds for the release of the person on probation on personal recognizance 35 
pending further proceedings.  36 
ยง1812.  Court hearing on probation revocation  37 
1.  Place of hearing .  The hearing on a motion to revoke probation must be held in 38 
the court that sentenced the person to probation in either the county or division in which 39 
the person resides or is incarcerated, unless the court orders otherwise in the interests of 40 
 
 Page 33 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 justice.  A motion for revocation of probation need not be heard by the justice or judge 1 
who originally imposed probation, but may be heard by any justice or judge.  2 
2.  Hearing procedure.   If a hearing is held, the person on probation must be given 3 
the opportunity to confront and cross -examine witnesses against the person, to present 4 
evidence on that person's own behalf and to be represented by counsel.  If the person 5 
cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  Assignment of 6 
counsel, to t he extent not covered in this subsection, and withdrawal of counsel must be 7 
in accordance with the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure.  8 
3.  Commission of new crime while on probation.   When the alleged violation 9 
constitutes a crime for which the pers on on probation has not been convicted, the court 10 
may revoke probation if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person 11 
committed the crime. If the person is subsequently convicted of the crime, or any other 12 
crime or crimes arising out of the  same conduct, sentencing is subject to the requirements 13 
of section 1608. If concurrent terms of imprisonment are imposed and the terms do not 14 
commence on the same date, any time served as a result of the probation revocation must 15 
be deducted from the time  the person is required to serve as a result of the new 16 
conviction.  17 
4.  Failure to comply with requirement of probation.   If the alleged violation does 18 
not constitute a crime and the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the 19 
person on probati on has inexcusably failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a 20 
condition of probation, it may revoke probation.  21 
5.  Conviction for new crime while on probation.   If a person on probation is 22 
convicted of a new crime during the period of probation, the court may sentence that 23 
person for the crime and revoke probation.  If the person has been sentenced for the new 24 
crime and probation revocation proceedings are subsequently commenced, the court that 25 
conducts the revocation hearing may revoke probation. Sen tencing for the multiple 26 
offenses is subject to section 1608. If concurrent terms of imprisonment are imposed and 27 
the terms do not commence on the same date, any time served as a result of the new 28 
conviction must be deducted from the time the person is req uired to serve as a result of 29 
the probation revocation.  30 
6.  Authority of court finding violation of probation.   Upon a finding of a violation 31 
of probation, the court may vacate all, part or none of the suspension of execution as to 32 
imprisonment or fine spe cified when probation was granted, considering the nature of the 33 
violation and the reasons for granting probation. The remaining portion of the sentence 34 
for which suspension of execution is not vacated upon the revocation of probation 35 
remains suspended and  is subject to revocation at a later date. During the service of that 36 
portion of the sentence imposed for which the suspension of execution was vacated upon 37 
revocation, the running of the period of probation must be interrupted and resumes again 38 
upon relea se.  If the court finds a violation of probation but vacates none of the suspended 39 
sentence, the running of the period of probation resumes upon entry of that final 40 
disposition.  The court may nevertheless revoke probation and vacate the suspension of 41 
execution as to the remainder of the suspended sentence or a portion thereof for any 42 
criminal conduct committed during the service of that portion of the sentence for which 43 
the suspension of execution was vacated upon revocation.  44 
 
 Page 34 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 7.  Tolling of period of proba tion; conditions of probation continue in effect.   The 1 
running of the period of probation is tolled upon either the delivery of the summons, the 2 
filing of the written notice with the court that the person cannot be located or the arrest of 3 
the person.  If the motion is dismissed or withdrawn, or if the court finds no violation of 4 
probation, the running of the period of probation is deemed not to have been tolled.  The 5 
conditions of probation continue in effect during the tolling of the running of the period  6 
of probation, and any violation of a condition subjects the person to a revocation of 7 
probation pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.  8 
8.  Disposition agreement by parties in return for admission of probation 9 
violation.   If the attorney for the St ate and the attorney for the person on probation or the 10 
person on probation reach agreement that, in return for an admission of a violation of 11 
probation, the attorney for the State will dismiss other charges or the attorney for the 12 
State will not oppose th e requested disposition requested by the person or the attorney for 13 
the State will recommend a particular disposition or both sides will recommend a 14 
particular disposition, and the court at the time of disposition intends to enter a 15 
disposition less favora ble to the person than that recommended, the court shall on the 16 
record:  17 
A.  Inform the parties of this intention;  18 
B.  Advise the person personally in open court that the court is not bound by the 19 
recommendation;  20 
C.  Advise the person that if the person doe s not withdraw the admission, the 21 
disposition of the motion will be less favorable to the person than that recommended; 22 
and 23 
D.  Give the person the opportunity to withdraw the admission.  24 
The court shall, if possible, inform the person of the intended dispo sition.  25 
9.  Deduction of time for detention pending revocation proceeding.   Whenever a 26 
person is detained in any correctional facility or county jail pending a probation 27 
revocation proceeding, and not in execution of any other sentence of confinement, that  28 
period of detention must be deducted from the time the person is required to serve under 29 
that portion of the sentence for which the suspension of execution was vacated as a result 30 
of the probation revocation.  A person who is simultaneously detained for c onduct for 31 
which the person receives a consecutive term of imprisonment is not entitled to receive a 32 
day-for-day deduction from the consecutive term of imprisonment for the period of 33 
simultaneous detention except for any period of detention that is longer than the prior 34 
term of imprisonment.  35 
10.  Respecification of place of imprisonment following vacation of suspension of 36 
sentence.   Whenever a previously suspended sentence of imprisonment for a Class A, 37 
Class B or Class C crime is vacated, in whole or in pa rt, as the result of a probation 38 
revocation, the court must respecify the place of imprisonment for both the portion 39 
required to be served and any remaining suspended portion, if necessary, to carry out the 40 
intent of section 1805, subsection 1.  41 
 
 Page 35 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 11.  Effect  of vacating suspension while person in execution of unsuspended 1 
portion of sentence.   If a probation revocation proceeding results in the court vacating a 2 
part of the suspension of execution as to imprisonment while the person is in execution of 3 
the initi al unsuspended portion of the sentence, the portion of imprisonment to be served 4 
as a result of the vacating commences only after the initial unsuspended portion of 5 
imprisonment has been fully served.  If separate probation revocation proceedings result 6 
in the vacating of 2 or more parts of the suspension of execution as to imprisonment on 7 
the same sentence, the portions to be served must be served successively.  8 
ยง1813.  Review  9 
1.  Discretionary appeal to Law Court.   Review of a revocation of probation 10 
pursu ant to section 1812 must be by appeal to the Law Court.  A person whose probation 11 
is revoked may not appeal as of right.  The time for taking the appeal and the manner and 12 
any conditions for the taking of the appeal are as the Supreme Judicial Court provid es by 13 
rule. 14 
2.  Assignment and withdrawal of counsel.   Assignment and withdrawal of counsel 15 
for an appeal under this section must be in accordance with the Maine Rules of Unified 16 
Criminal Procedure.  17 
ยง1814.  Additional conditions in lieu of probation revoca tion proceedings  18 
Whenever a probation officer has probable cause to believe that a person under the 19 
supervision of that probation officer has violated a condition of probation but the 20 
violation does not constitute a crime, the probation officer, instead of  commencing a 21 
probation revocation proceeding under section 1809, may offer to the person the option of 22 
adding one or more of the following conditions to the person's probation:  23 
1.  Participation in public restitution program or treatment program.   The 24 
person will participate in a public restitution program or treatment program administered 25 
through a correctional facility or county jail; or  26 
2.  Residence at correctional facility.   The person will reside at a correctional 27 
facility or county jail for a period  of time not to exceed 90 days.  28 
If the person agrees in writing to the additional conditions under subsection 1 or 2, 29 
the conditions must be implemented.  If the person does not agree or if the person fails to 30 
fulfill the additional conditions to the satis faction of the probation officer, the probation 31 
officer may commence probation revocation proceedings under section 1809 or 1810 for 32 
the violation that the probation officer had probable cause to believe occurred.  If the 33 
person fulfills the additional con ditions to the satisfaction of the probation officer, the 34 
probation officer shall so notify the person in writing and the probation officer may not 35 
commence probation revocation proceedings for the violation that the probation officer 36 
had probable cause to  believe occurred.  37 
SUBCHAPTER 2  38 
ADMINISTRATIVE RELEA SE 39 
 
 Page 36 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 ยง1851.  Eligibility for sentencing alternative that includes period of administrative 1 
release; exceptions  2 
The court may sentence a person who has been convicted of a Class D or Class E 3 
crime or a Class  C crime under Title 29 -A, former section 2557, section 2557 -A or 4 
section 2558 to a sentencing alternative under section 1502, subsection 2, paragraphs I, J 5 
and K for an individual and section 1502, subsection 7, paragraph E for an organization, 6 
unless:  7 
1.  Sentencing alternative includes probation.   The court sentences the person to a 8 
sentencing alternative under section 1502 that includes a period of probation; or  9 
2.  Sentencing alternative diminishes gravity of crime.   The court finds that such a 10 
senten ce would diminish the gravity of the crime for which that person was convicted.  11 
ยง1852.  Period of administrative release  12 
1.  Time limit.   A period of administrative release imposed pursuant to this 13 
subchapter may not exceed one year.  14 
2.  Modification of re quirements.   During the period of administrative release and 15 
upon application of a person placed on administrative release or of the attorney for the 16 
State or upon the court's own motion, the court, after notice to the attorney for the State 17 
and the person  and a hearing, may modify the requirements imposed by the court, add 18 
further requirements or release the person of any requirement imposed by the court that, 19 
in the court's opinion, imposes on the person an unreasonable burden.  20 
3.  Inability to meet requi rement; duty on person to bring motion.   During the 21 
period of administrative release, if the person cannot meet a requirement of 22 
administrative release imposed by the court, the person shall bring a motion pursuant to 23 
subsection 2.  24 
4.  Termination by court .  On application of the attorney for the State or of the 25 
person placed on administrative release or on the court's own motion, the court may 26 
terminate a period of administrative release and discharge the person at any time earlier 27 
than that provided in th e sentence made pursuant to subsection 1 if warranted by the 28 
conduct of the person.  The court may not order a termination of the period of 29 
administrative release and discharge upon the motion of the person placed on 30 
administrative release unless notice of  the motion is given to the attorney for the State by 31 
the person placed on administrative release.  The termination of the period of 32 
administrative release and discharge relieves the person placed on administrative release 33 
of any obligations imposed by the  sentence of administrative release.  34 
5.  Termination to prevent delay of consecutive term of imprisonment.   The 35 
court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, may terminate a period of 36 
administrative release that would delay commencement of a c onsecutive unsuspended 37 
term of imprisonment.  38 
 
 Page 37 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 ยง1853.  Suspended sentence with administrative release  1 
1.  Suspension of term of imprisonment accompanied by administrative release.   2 
The court may sentence a person to a term of imprisonment not to exceed the m aximum 3 
term authorized for a Class D or Class E crime or the Class C crime under Title 29 -A, 4 
former section 2557, section 2557 -A or section 2558, suspend the term of imprisonment 5 
in whole or in part and accompany the suspension with a period of administrat ive release.  6

 Page 39 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 ยง1881.  Inclusion of period of supervised release after imprisonment  1 
1.  Mandatory imposition of supervised release.   If a person is convicted of gross 2 
sexual assault with a person who has not yet attained 12 years of age, in violation of 3 
section 253, subsection 1, paragraph C, the court, in addition to imposing as part of the 4 
sentence a definite term of imprisonment in accordance with section 253 -A, subsection 2, 5 
shall impose as par t of the sentence a period of supervised release of up to life to 6 
immediately follow that imprisonment.  The period of supervised release commences on 7 
the date the person is released from confinement pursuant to section 2314 and must 8 
include the best avail able monitoring technology for the full period of supervised release.  9 
2.  Discretionary imposition of supervised release.   If a person is convicted of 10 
gross sexual assault in violation of any provision of section 253 other than section 253, 11 
subsection 1, p aragraph C, the court, if it imposes as part of the sentence a definite term 12 
of imprisonment that does not include a period of probation, also may impose as part of 13 
the sentence a period of supervised release to immediately follow that imprisonment.  The 14 
period of supervised release commences on the date the person is released from 15 
confinement pursuant to section 2314.  16 
If a person has been convicted of violating any provision of section 253 other than section 17 
253, subsection 1, paragraph C, the authorized p eriod of supervised release is:  18 
A.  Any period of years for a person sentenced as a repeat sexual assault offender 19 
pursuant to section 253 -A, subsection 1; and  20 
B.  For a person not sentenced under section 253 -A, subsection 1 or 2, a period not to 21 
exceed 10  years for a Class A violation of section 253 and a period not to exceed 6 22 
years for a Class B or Class C violation of section 253.  23 
3.  Modification of requirements.   During the period of supervised release specified 24 
in the sentence made pursuant to subsec tions 1 and 2, and upon application of a person on 25 
supervised release or the person's probation officer, or upon the court's own motion, the 26 
court, after notice to the probation officer and the person on supervised release and a 27 
hearing, may modify the req uirements imposed by the court, add further requirements 28 
authorized by section 1882 or relieve the person on supervised release of any requirement 29 
imposed by the court that, in its opinion, imposes on the person an unreasonable burden.  30 
4.  Ex parte modific ation of requirements for immediate necessity.   31 
Notwithstanding subsection 3, the court may grant, ex parte, a motion brought by the 32 
probation officer of the person on supervised release to add further requirements if the 33 
court determines that all reasonab le efforts have been made to give written or oral notice 34 
to the person on supervised release and the requirements are immediately necessary to 35 
protect the safety of an individual or the public.  Any requirements added pursuant to an 36 
ex parte motion do not take effect until written notice of the requirements, along with 37 
written notice of the scheduled date, time and place when the court will hold a hearing on 38 
the added requirements, is given to the person on supervised release.  39 
5.  Termination by court.   On application of the person on supervised release or the 40 
person's probation officer, or on the court's own motion, and if warranted by the conduct 41 
of the person, the court may terminate a period of supervised release and discharge the 42 
 
 Page 40 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 person at any time earl ier than that provided in the sentence made pursuant to subsections 1 
1 and 2.  A termination and discharge may not be ordered unless notice of the motion is 2 
given to the probation officer and the attorney for the State.  A termination and discharge 3 
relieves  the person on supervised release of any obligations imposed by the sentence of 4 
supervised release.  5 
6.  Termination to prevent delay of consecutive term of imprisonment.   The 6 
court, in order to comply with section 1608, subsection 7, may terminate a period  of 7 
supervised release that would delay commencement of a consecutive unsuspended term 8 
of imprisonment.  9 
7.  Revoked period of supervised release to be served in prison.   The court may 10 
revoke a period of supervised release pursuant to section 1883 for any g round specified in 11 
subsection 8.  If the court revokes a period of supervised release, the court shall require 12 
the person to serve time in prison under the custody of the Department of Corrections.  13 
This time in prison may equal all or part of the period o f supervised release, without 14 
credit for time served on post -release supervision.  The remaining portion of the period of 15 
supervised release that is not required to be served in prison, if any, may not run during 16 
the time in prison and must resume again af ter the person's release and is subject to 17 
revocation at a later date.  18 
8.  Grounds for revocation.   The court may revoke a period of supervised release 19 
for: 20 
A.  A violation of supervised release;  21 
B.  Criminal conduct committed during the term of imprisonme nt; or  22 
C.  Refusal during the term of imprisonment to actively participate, when requested 23 
to do so by the Department of Corrections, in a sex offender treatment program in 24 
accordance with the expectations and judgment of the treatment providers.  25 
ยง1882.  C onditions of supervised release  26 
If the court imposes a sentence that includes a period of supervised release, it shall set 27 
conditions of supervised release.  The conditions of release that apply to probation under 28 
section 1807 apply to conditions of superv ised release.  The court may also set conditions 29 
of supervised release that it determines to be reasonable and appropriate to manage the 30 
person's behavior.  31 
ยง1883.  Revocation procedures  32 
The procedures, rights and responsibilities that apply to probation re vocation under 33 
sections 1809 to 1812, including bail under section 1811, subsections 5 and 6 and 34 
appellate review of revocation under section 1813, apply to revocation of supervised 35 
release.  36

 ยง1901.  Eligibility for deferre d disposition  1 
A person who has pleaded guilty to a Class C, Class D or Class E crime and who 2 
consents to a deferred disposition in writing is eligible for a deferred disposition.  3 
ยง1902.  Deferred disposition  4 
1.  Authority of court to order deferment and im pose requirements; 5 
administrative supervision fee.   Following the acceptance of a plea of guilty for a crime 6 
for which a person is eligible for a deferred disposition under section 1901, the court may 7 
order sentencing deferred to a date certain or determin able and impose requirements upon 8 
the person, to be in effect during the period of deferment, considered by the court to be 9 
reasonable and appropriate to assist the person to lead a law -abiding life.  The court - 10 
imposed deferment requirements must include a  requirement that the person refrain from 11 
criminal conduct and may include a requirement that the person pay to the appropriate 12 
county an administrative supervision fee of not more than $50 per month, as determined 13 
by the court, for the term of the deferme nt.  In determining the amount of the fee, the 14 
court shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the 15 
burden its payment imposes.  In exchange for the deferred sentencing, the person shall 16 
abide by the court -imposed defer ment requirements.  Unless the court orders otherwise, 17 
the requirements are immediately in effect.  18 
2.  Modification of requirements.   During the period of deferment and upon 19 
application of the person granted deferred disposition pursuant to subsection 1 or  of the 20 
attorney for the State or upon the court's own motion, the court may, after a hearing upon 21 
notice to the attorney for the State and the person, modify the requirements imposed by 22 
the court, add further requirements or relieve the person of any requ irement imposed by 23 
the court that, in the court's opinion, imposes an unreasonable burden on the person.  24 
3.  Inability to meet requirement; duty on person to bring motion.   During the 25 
period of deferment, if the person cannot meet a deferment requirement i mposed by the 26 
court, the person shall bring a motion pursuant to subsection 2.  27 
4.  Determination of date of conviction; bail.   For purposes of a deferred 28 
disposition, a person is deemed to have been convicted when the court imposes the 29 
sentence.  Notwithst anding Title 15, chapter 105 -A, subchapter 3, prior to sentence 30 
imposition, preconviction bail applies to the person.  31 
5.  Preferred disposition in prosecution for possession of schedule W drug.   A 32 
deferred disposition is a preferred disposition in a prosec ution for possession of schedule 33 
W drugs under section 1107 -A, subsection 1, paragraphs B and B -1. 34 
ยง1903.  Court hearing as to final disposition  35 
1.  Final disposition following period of deferment.   Unless a court hearing is 36 
sooner held under subsection 3,  and except as provided in subsection 2, at the conclusion 37 
of the period of deferment, after notice, a person who was granted deferred disposition 38 
pursuant to section 1902 shall return to court for a hearing on final disposition.  If the 39 
person demonstrate s by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has complied 40 
 
 Page 42 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 with the court -imposed deferment requirements, the court shall impose a sentencing 1 
alternative authorized for the crime to which the person pled guilty and consented to in 2 
writing at the tim e sentencing was deferred or as amended by agreement of the parties in 3 
writing prior to sentencing, unless the attorney for the State, prior to sentence imposition, 4 
moves the court to allow the person to withdraw the plea of guilty.  Except over the 5 
object ion of the person, the court shall grant the State's motion.  If the court grants the 6 
State's motion, the attorney for the State shall dismiss the pending charging instrument 7 
with prejudice.  If the court finds that the person has inexcusably failed to com ply with 8 
the court -imposed deferment requirements, the court shall impose a sentencing alternative 9 
authorized for the crime to which the person pled guilty.  10 
2.  Consensual withdrawal of guilty plea by parties.   Notwithstanding subsection 11 
1, if at the concl usion of the period of deferment and prior to sentence imposition the 12 
attorney for the State in writing moves the court to allow the person to withdraw the plea 13 
of guilty and the person in writing agrees to such withdrawal, the court may, without a 14 
hearing  on final disposition and in the absence of the person, grant the attorney for the 15 
State's motion and allow the person to withdraw the plea.  Following such court action, 16 
the attorney for the State shall dismiss the pending charging instrument with prejudi ce. 17 
3.  Violation of deferment requirement.   If during the period of deferment the 18 
attorney for the State has probable cause to believe that a person who was granted 19 
deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 has violated a court -imposed deferment 20 
requi rement, the attorney for the State may move the court to terminate the remainder of 21 
the period of deferment and impose sentence.  Following notice and hearing, if the 22 
attorney for the State proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has 23 
inexcusably failed to comply with a court -imposed deferment requirement, the court may 24 
continue the running of the period of deferment with the requirements unchanged, modify 25 
the requirements, add further requirements or terminate the running of the period of 26 
deferment and impose a sentencing alternative authorized for the crime to which the 27 
person pled guilty.  When a person fails to pay an administrative supervision fee imposed 28 
under section 1902, subsection 1, the court may terminate the running of the perio d of 29 
deferment and impose sentence unless the person shows that failure to pay was not 30 
attributable to a willful refusal to pay or to a failure on that person's part to make a good 31 
faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment.  If the court fi nds that the person 32 
has not inexcusably failed to comply with a court -imposed deferment requirement, the 33 
court may order that the running of the period of deferment continue or, after notice and 34 
hearing, take any other action permitted under this subchapte r. 35 
4.  Place of hearing.   A hearing under this section or section 1902 must be held in 36 
the court that ordered the deferred disposition.  The hearing need not be conducted by the 37 
justice or judge who originally ordered the deferred disposition.  38 
5.  Rights o f person at hearing.   The person at a hearing under this section or 39 
section 1902 must be given the opportunity to confront and cross -examine witnesses 40 
against the person, to present evidence on that person's own behalf and to be represented 41 
by counsel.  If  the person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 42 
cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.  Assignment of 43 
 
 Page 43 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 counsel and withdrawal of counsel must be in accordance with the Maine Rules of 1 
Unified Criminal  Procedure.  2 
6.  Summons to appear at hearing; failure to appear.   A summons may be used to 3 
order a person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 to appear 4 
for a hearing under this section.  If the person fails to appear after having been served 5 
with a summons, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.  6 
7.  Authority of attorney for State regarding violation of condition of deferment.   7 
If during the period of deferment the attorney for the State has probable cause to b elieve 8 
that a person who was granted deferred disposition pursuant to section 1902 has violated 9 
a court -imposed deferment requirement, the attorney for the State may apply for a 10 
warrant for the arrest of the person or request that a warrantless arrest be m ade of the 11 
person pursuant to section 15, subsection 1, paragraph A, subparagraph (17).  12 
ยง1904.  Limited review by appeal  13 
A person may not attack the legality of a deferred disposition, including a final 14 
disposition, except that a person who has been determ ined by a court to have inexcusably 15 
failed to comply with a court -imposed deferment requirement and thereafter has been 16 
sentenced to an alternative authorized for the crime may appeal to the Law Court, but not 17 
as of right.  The time for taking the appeal a nd the manner and any conditions for the 18 
taking of the appeal are as the Supreme Judicial Court provides by rule.  19 
CHAPTER 69  20 
RESTITUTION  21 
ยง2001.  Purpose  22 
The Legislature finds and declares that the victims of crimes often suffer losses 23 
through no fault of t heir own and for which there is no compensation. It also finds that 24 
repayment, in whole or in part, by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime can 25 
operate to rehabilitate the offender in certain instances. It is the purpose of this chapter to 26 
encourage the compensation of victims by the person most responsible for the loss 27 
incurred by the victim, the offender. Restitution by the offender can serve to reinforce the 28 
offender's sense of responsibility for the offense, to provide the offender the opp ortunity 29 
to pay the offender's debt to society and to the offender's victim in a constructive manner 30 
and to ease the burden of the victim as a result of the criminal conduct.  31 
The Legislature recognizes that a crime is an offense against society as a whole,  not 32 
only against the victim of the crime, and that restitution for victims is therefore ancillary 33 
to the central objectives of the criminal law. It intends restitution to be applied only when 34 
other purposes of sentencing can be appropriately served.  35 
The L egislature does not intend the use of restitution to result in preferential 36 
treatment for offenders with substantial financial resources.  37

ยง2005.  Criteria for restitution  11 
1.  Restitution authorized.   Restitution may be authorized, in whole or in part, as 12 
compensation for economic loss. In determining the amou nt of restitution authorized, the 13 
following must be considered:  14 
A.  The contributory misconduct of the victim;  15 
B.  Failure to report the crime to a law enforcement officer within 72 hours after its 16 
occurrence, without good cause for failure to report withi n that time; and  17 
C.  The present and future financial capacity of the offender to pay restitution.  18 
2.  Restitution not authorized.   Restitution is not authorized:  19 
A.  To a victim without that victim's consent;  20 
B.  To a victim who is an accomplice of the o ffender;  21 
C.  To a victim who has otherwise been compensated from a collateral source, but 22 
economic loss in excess of the collateral compensation may be authorized; and  23 
D.  When the amount and method of payment of monetary restitution or the 24 
performance of service restitution creates an excessive financial hardship on the 25 
offender or dependent of the offender. In making this determination, all relevant 26 
factors must be considered, including, but not limited to, the following:  27 
(1)  The number of the offender's  dependents;  28 
(2)  The minimum living expenses of the offender and the offender's dependents;  29 
(3)  The special needs of the offender and the offender's dependents, including 30 
necessary travel expense to and from work;  31 
(4)  The offender's present income and p otential future earning capacity; and  32 
(5)  The offender's resources, from whatever source.  33

 Page 48 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 4.  Burdens of proof.   An offender who asserts a pre sent or future incapacity to pay 1 
restitution has the burden of proving the incapacity by a preponderance of the evidence.  2 
On appeal of a restitution order, the offender has the burden of demonstrating that the 3 
incapacity was proven as a matter of law.  4 
ยง2006.  Time and method of restitution  5 
When restitution is authorized, and the offender is not committed to the Department 6 
of Corrections and does not receive a sentence that includes a period of probation, the 7 
time and method of payment or of the performance  of the services must be specified by 8 
the court and monetary compensation may be ordered paid to the office of the prosecuting 9 
attorney who is prosecuting the case or to the clerk of the court.  If the offender is 10 
committed to the Department of Corrections  or receives a sentence that includes a period 11 
of probation, monetary compensation must be paid to the Department of Corrections and 12 
the time and method of payment must be determined by the Department of Corrections 13 
during the term of commitment or the per iod of probation unless at the time of sentencing 14 
the court has specified the time and method of payment.  Once any term of commitment 15 
to the Department of Corrections or period of probation is completed and if the restitution 16 
ordered has not been paid in full, the offender is subject to the provisions of section 2011 17 
and, in the event of a default, the provisions of section 2015.  The state agency receiving 18 
the restitution shall deposit any money received in the account maintained by the 19 
Treasurer of State  for deposit of state agency funds, from which funds are daily 20 
transferred to an investment account and invested.  Interest accrued on that money is the 21 
property of and accrues to the State for deposit in the General Fund.  The agency 22 
receiving the restitu tion shall make the disbursement to the victim or other authorized 23 
claimant as soon as possible after the agency receives the money.  24 
ยง2007.  Income withholding order  25 
1.  Instructions for employer.   When restitution is required of an offender who will 26 
not b e commencing service of a period of institutional confinement, who does not receive 27 
a sentence that includes a period of probation and who is employed, the court shall, at the 28 
time of ordering restitution, enter a separate order for income withholding.  Wh en 29 
restitution is required of an offender who receives a sentence that includes a period of 30 
probation and who is employed, upon application of the offender's probation officer, the 31 
court shall enter a separate order for income withholding.  The withholding  order must 32 
direct the employer to deduct from all income due and payable to the offender an amount 33 
determined pursuant to section 2006 to meet the offender's restitution obligation.  The 34 
withholding order must include an instruction to the employer that u pon receipt of a copy 35 
of the withholding order the employer shall:  36 
A.  Immediately begin to withhold the offender's income when the offender is usually 37 
paid;  38 
B.  Send each amount withheld to the agency to which restitution has been ordered to 39 
be paid at th e address set forth in the order within 7 business days of the withholding; 40 
and 41 
C.  Identify each amount sent to the agency by indicating the court's docket number.  42 
 
 Page 49 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 2.  Term of order.   The income withholding order is effective as long as the order for 1 
restitution upon which it is based is effective, including after a defendant is no longer in 2 
the custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and has not paid 3 
the restitution in full as described in section 2011, or until further order of the court.  4 
ยง2008.  Deceased victims  5 
An offender's obligation to pay restitution is not affected by the death of the victim to 6 
whom the restitution is due.  The money collected as restitution must be forwarded to the 7 
estate of the victim.  8 
ยง2009.  Victim una ble to be located  9 
If the location of a victim cannot, with due diligence, be ascertained, the money 10 
collected as restitution must be forwarded to the Treasurer of State to be handled as 11 
unclaimed property.  12 
ยง2010.  Joint and several order  13 
If the victim's fi nancial loss has been caused by more than one offender, the order 14 
must designate that the restitution is to be paid on a joint and several basis, unless the 15 
court specifically determines that one defendant should not equally share the burden.  The 16 
agency c ollecting restitution pursuant to a joint and several order may, after the full 17 
amount of restitution has been collected and disbursed to the victim, continue to collect 18 
payments from an offender who has not paid an equal share of the restitution and may 19 
disburse the money collected to any other offender who has paid more than an equal 20 
share of the restitution.  21 
ยง2011.  Former Department of Correctionsโ clients owing restitution  22 
An offender is responsible for paying any restitution outstanding at the time th e term 23 
of commitment to the Department of Corrections or period of probation is completed.  An 24 
offender who has complied with the time and method of payment of monetary 25 
compensation determined by the Department of Corrections during the period of 26 
probation  shall continue to make payments to the Department of Corrections in 27 
accordance with that payment schedule unless modified by the court pursuant to section 28 
2014 or 2015.  An offender who has not complied with the time and method of payment 29 
of monetary comp ensation determined by the Department of Corrections during the 30 
period of probation must be returned to the court for further disposition pursuant to 31 
section 2015.  An offender who is unconditionally released and discharged from 32 
institutional confinement w ith the Department of Corrections upon the expiration of the 33 
sentence must, upon application of the office of the attorney for the State, be returned to 34 
the court for specification by the court of the time and method of payment of monetary 35 
compensation, wh ich may be ordered paid to the office of the attorney for the State who 36 
prosecuted the case or to the clerk of the court.  Prior to the offender's release and 37 
discharge, the Department of Corrections shall provide the office of the attorney for the 38 
State w ho prosecuted the case written notice as to the amount of restitution outstanding.  39 
An income withholding order issued pursuant to section 2007 remains effective and 40 
 
 Page 50 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 enforceable until the restitution is paid in full, even after an offender is no longer in the 1 
custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections.  2 
ยง2012.  Restitution deducted from judgment in civil action  3 
Any restitution ordered and paid must be deducted from the amount of any judgment 4 
awarded in a civil action brought by the vic tim against the offender based on the same 5 
facts. If the restitution ordered and made was work restitution, the reasonable value of the 6 
services may be deducted from any such judgment.  7 
ยง2013.  Post -conviction relief  8 
If, in any judicial proceeding following  conviction, a court issues a final judgment 9 
invalidating the conviction, the judgment may include an order that any or all of a 10 
restitution payment that the convicted person paid pursuant to the sentence for that 11 
conviction be returned to the convicted pe rson.  12 
ยง2014.  Modification of restitution  13 
A convicted person who cannot make restitution payments in the manner ordered by 14 
the court or determined by the Department of Corrections pursuant to section 2006 shall 15 
move the court for a modification of the time  or method of payment or service to avoid a 16 
default.  The court may modify its prior order or the determination of the Department of 17 
Corrections to reduce the amount of each installment or to allow additional time for 18 
payment or service.  19 
ยง2015.  Default  20 
1.  Return to court.  An offender who has been sentenced to make restitution and has 21 
defaulted in payment or service thereof must be returned to court to explain the failure to 22 
pay or perform the service.  23 
2.  Reports.   A probation officer having knowledge of a default in restitution by an 24 
offender shall report the default to the office of the attorney for the State.  An attorney for 25 
the State having knowledge of a default in restitution by an offender shall report the 26 
default to the court.  If the restitution was a condition of probation, the attorney for the 27 
State may file a motion to enforce payment of restitution or, with the written consent of 28 
the probation officer, a motion to revoke probation under section 1811.  If the restitution 29 
was not a condition of probation, the attorney for the State may file a motion to enforce 30 
payment of restitution.  31 
3.  Motion to enforce payment of restitution.   Either the attorney for the State or 32 
the court may initiate a motion to enforce payment of restitution.  Notification for the 33 
hearing on the motion must be sent by regular mail to the offender's last known address.  34 
If the offender does not appear for the hearing after proper notification has been sent, the 35 
court may issue a bench warrant.  36 
A.  Unless the offender shows by  a preponderance of the evidence that the default 37 
was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or 38 
to a failure on the offender's part to make a good -faith effort to obtain the funds 39 
 
 Page 51 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 required to make payment, the court  shall find that the default was unexcused and 1 
may commit the offender to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part of 2 
the restitution is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcused 3 
default must be specified in the court' s order and may not exceed one day for every 4 
$5 of unpaid restitution or 6 months, whichever is shorter. An offender committed for 5 
nonpayment of restitution is given credit toward the payment of restitution for each 6 
day of confinement that the offender is in custody, at the rate specified in the court's 7 
order.  The offender is also given credit for each day that the offender has been 8 
detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued pursuant to this section.  An offender 9 
is responsible for paying any resti tution remaining after receiving credit for 10 
confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining restitution is also governed 11 
by this section.  12 
B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the offender 13 
additional time for payment or  may reduce the amount of each installment.  14 
C.  The confinement ordered under this subsection must be nonconcurrent with any 15 
judgment of conviction involving a term of imprisonment.  16 
4.  Forfeiture of bail.   When an offender who has been sentenced to make r estitution 17 
and has defaulted in payment or service of the restitution is declared in forfeiture of bail 18 
in the proceeding brought under this section pursuant to Title 15, section 1094, the 19 
obligation and sureties of the defendant must be enforced pursuant to Title 15, section 20 
1094 and the district attorney shall use the proceeds to satisfy the offenderโs restitution 21 
obligation.  Any proceeds from the forfeited bail remaining after the offenderโs restitution 22 
obligation has been satisfied must be used in acco rdance with Title 15, section 224 -A, 23 
subsection 2.  24 
5.  Collection.   Upon any default, execution may be levied and other measures 25 
authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments may be taken to collect the unpaid 26 
restitution.  A levy of execution do es not discharge an offender confined to a county jail 27 
under subsection 3 for unexcused default until the full amount of the restitution has been 28 
collected.  29 
6.  Organizations.   When restitution is imposed on an organization, the person or 30 
persons authorize d to make disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay 31 
the restitution from the organization's assets.  Failure to do so may subject the person or 32 
persons to court action pursuant to this section.  33 
7.  Payments.   Payments made pursuant to thi s section must be made to the same 34 
agency to which the restitution was required to be paid under section 2006 or section 35 
2011, except that if the offender is no longer in the custody or under the supervision of 36 
the Department of Corrections the payments mu st be made to the office of the attorney 37 
for the State who prosecuted the case or the clerk of the court, as ordered by the court.  38

34-A, section 1403, subsection 9 or any other program administered by the Department of 2 
Corrections or a sheriff by which a prisoner is able to generate money, unless the prisoner 3 
consents to pay at least 25% of the prisoner's gross weekly wages or other money 4 
generated to the victim or the court until such time as full restitution has been made or the 5 
fine is paid in full.  The chief administrative officer of the correctional facility where the 6 
prisoner is incarcerated shall collect and disburse to the victim or  victims that portion of 7 
the prisoner's wages or other money generated agreed to as payment of restitution.  The 8 
chief administrative officer of the correctional facility where the prisoner is incarcerated 9 
shall also collect and disburse to the court that portion of the prisoner's wages or other 10 
money generated agreed to as payment of fines after the restitution is paid in full.  If the 11 
victim or victims ordered by the court to receive restitution cannot be located, the 12 
correctional facility shall inform th e court that ordered restitution. The court shall 13 
determine the distribution of these funds.  14 
2.  Payment of restitution or fines from other sources.   A prisoner, other than one 15 
addressed by subsection 1, who receives money, from any source, shall pay 25% o f that 16 
money to any victim or the court if the court has ordered that restitution or a fine be paid.  17 
The chief administrative officer of the correctional facility in which the prisoner is 18 
incarcerated shall collect and disburse to the victim or victims th at portion of the 19 
prisoner's money ordered as restitution.  The chief administrative officer of the 20 
correctional facility where the prisoner is incarcerated shall also collect and disburse to 21 
the court that portion of the prisoner's money ordered as fines after the restitution is paid 22 
in full.  If the victim or victims ordered by the court to receive restitution cannot be 23 
located, the correctional facility shall inform the court that ordered restitution. The court 24 
shall determine the distribution of these f unds.  Money received by the prisoner and 25 
directly deposited into a telephone call account established by the Department of 26 
Corrections for the sole purpose of paying for use of the department's client telephone 27 
system is not subject to this subsection, ex cept that 25% of any money received by the 28 
prisoner and transferred from the telephone call account to the department's general client 29 
account at the time of the prisoner's discharge or transfer to supervised community 30 
confinement must be collected and dis bursed as provided in this subsection.  31 
3.  Restitution; absolute.   The requirements imposed on a prisoner by this section to 32 
pay restitution and fines during incarceration apply regardless of whether:  33 
A.  The court order to pay restitution or fines constit utes a sentence or is imposed as a 34 
condition of probation;  35 
B.  Payment has been stayed in the court order;  36 
C.  The court has specified a time and method of payment pursuant to section 1708, 37

ยง2017.  Waiver of issue of excessiveness  40 
If a defendant at the time of sentencing has consented to the imposition by the 41 
sentencing court of a specific amount of restitution, the defendant is thereafter precluded 42 
 
 Page 53 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 from  seeking to attack the legality or propriety of the amount of restitution ordered if that 1 
amount does not exceed the specific amount consented to by the defendant.  2 
ยง2018.  Restitution for benefit of victim  3 
When compensation is awarded from the Victims' Com pensation Fund pursuant to 4 
Title 5, chapter 316 -A, the amount of any restitution ordered to be paid to or for the 5 
benefit of the victim and collected as part of a sentence imposed must be paid by the 6 
agency collecting the restitution in an amount not to ex ceed the amount of the payments 7 
from the fund, directly to the fund if, when added to the payments from the fund, the 8 
restitution exceeds the victim's actual loss.  9 
ยง2019.  Civil remedy upon default  10 
Upon the request of the attorney for the State or a person  entitled to restitution under 11 
an order of restitution, the clerk shall enter the order of restitution in the same manner as 12 
a judgment in a civil action.  When entered under this section, the order of restitution is 13

ยง253 -A.  Special sentencing provisions for gross sexual assault  12 
1.  Any term of years; nonmandatory sentence alternative.   If the State pleads and 13 
proves that the defendant is a repeat sexual assault offender, the court may impose a 14 
definite term of imprisonment for any term of years.  The court also may impose as part 15 
of the sentence either a period of probation of any term of years pursu ant to section 1804, 16 
subsection 4 or a period of supervised release of any term of years pursuant to section 17 
1881, subsection 2, paragraph A.  18 
As used in this subsection, "repeat sexual assault offender" means a person who commits 19 
a new gross sexual assault  after having been convicted previously and sentenced for any 20 
of the following:  21 
A.  Gross sexual assault, formerly denominated as gross sexual misconduct;  22 
B.  Rape;  23 
C.  Attempted murder accompanied by sexual assault;  24 
D.  Murder accompanied by sexual assaul t; or 25 
E.  Conduct substantially similar to a crime listed in paragraphs A to D that is a crime 26 
under the laws of another jurisdiction.  27 
For purposes of determining whether a defendant is a repeat sexual assault offender, the 28 
date of sentencing is the date o f the oral pronouncement of the sentence by the trial court, 29 
even if an appeal is taken.  30 
"Accompanied by sexual assault" as used with respect to attempted murder, murder and 31 
crimes involving substantially similar conduct in another jurisdiction is satisfie d if it was 32 
definitionally an element of the crime or was pleaded and proved.  33 
2.  Any term of years; mandatory sentence alternative.   If the State pleads and 34 
proves that a crime under section 253 was committed against an individual who had not 35 
yet attained  12 years of age, the court shall impose a definite term of imprisonment for 36 
any term of years.  In determining the basic term of imprisonment as the first step in the 37 
sentencing process specified in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph A, the court shall  38 
 
 Page 77 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 select a definite term of at least 20 years.  The court shall also impose as part of the 1 
sentence a period of supervised release to immediately follow that definite term of 2 
imprisonment as mandated by section 1881, subsection 1.  3 
3.  Aggravating sentencing  factors.   The court shall treat the following as an 4 
aggravating sentencing factor.  5 
A.  If the State pleads and proves that a Class A crime of gross sexual assault was 6 
committed by an individual who had previously been convicted and sentenced for a 7 
Class B  or Class C crime of unlawful sexual contact, or an essentially similar crime 8 
in another jurisdiction, the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, shall treat 9 
as an aggravating sentencing factor that prior conviction.  10 
B.  If the State pleads and pr oves that a violation of section 253, subsection 1 or 2 11 
was committed in a safe children zone, the court, in determining the appropriate 12 
sentence, shall treat this as an aggravating sentencing factor.  13 
C.  In using a sentencing alternative involving a term of imprisonment for an 14 
individual convicted of violating section 253, a court, in determining the maximum 15 
period of incarceration as the 2nd step in the sentencing process specified in section 16 
1602, subsection 1, paragraph B, shall treat each prior Maine c onviction for a 17 
violation of section 253 as an aggravating sentencing factor.  18 
(1)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 19 
A, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of 4 20 
years of imprisonm ent. 21 
(2)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 22 
B, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of 2 23 
years of imprisonment.  24 
(3)  When the sentencing class for a prior conviction under section 253 is Class 25 
C, the court shall enhance the basic period of incarceration by a minimum of one 26 
year of imprisonment.  27 
D.  In arriving at the final sentence as the 3rd step in the sentencing process specified 28 
in section 1602, subsection 1, paragraph C, the co urt may not suspend that portion of 29 
the maximum term of incarceration based on a prior conviction.  30 
Sec. B -13.  17-A MRSA ยง282, sub -ยง3 is enacted to read:  31 
3.  Aggravating sentencing factor of victim under 12 years of age.   If the State 32 
pleads and proves tha t a crime under this section was committed against an individual 33 
who had not attained 12 years of age, the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, 34 
shall treat the age of the victim as an aggravating sentencing factor.  35 
Sec. B -14.  17-A MRSA ยง1125 is enacted to read:  36 
ยง1125.  Mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for certain drug offenses  37 
1.  Minimum term of imprisonment.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 38 
and 3, the minimum term of imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows:  39 
 
 Page 78 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 A.  When the sentencing class is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 4 1 
years;  2 
B.  When the sentencing class is Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 2 3 
years; and  4 
C.  With the exception of a conviction under section 1105 -A, 1105 -B, 1105 -C or  5 
1105 -D when the drug that is the basis for the charge is marijuana, when the 6 
sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is one year.  7 
2.  Finding by court necessary to impose other than mandatory minimum term 8 
of imprisonment.   The court may impose a sentence other than a minimum unsuspended 9 
term of imprisonment set forth in subsection 1 if:  10 
A.  The court finds by substantial evidence that:  11 
(1)  Imposition of a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 12 
subsection 1 will result in subs tantial injustice to the individual.  In making this 13 
determination, the court shall consider, among other considerations, whether the 14 
individual did not know and reasonably should not have known that the victim 15 
was less than 18 years of age;  16 
(2)  Failure t o impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 17 
subsection 1 will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and  18 
(3)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 19 
subsection 1 will not appreciably impair the effect of subs ection 1 in deterring 20 
others from violating section 1105 -A, 1105 -B, 1105 -C, 1105 -D or 1118 -A; and  21 
B.  The court finds that the individual's background, attitude and prospects for 22 
rehabilitation and the nature of the victim and the offense indicate that imp osition of 23 
a sentence under subsection 1 would frustrate the general purposes of sentencing set 24 
forth in section 1501.  25 
If the court imposes a sentence under this subsection, the court shall state in writing or on 26 
the record its reasons for its findings and  for imposing a sentence under this subsection 27 
rather than under subsection 1.  28 
3.  Reduced mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.   If the court imposes a 29 
sentence under subsection 2, the minimum term of imprisonment, which may not be 30 
suspended, is as foll ows:  31 
A.  When the sentencing class is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 9 32 
months;  33 
B.  When the sentencing class is Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 6 34 
months; and  35 
C.  With the exception of trafficking or furnishing marijuana under sec tion 1105 -A or 36 
1105 -C, when the sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is 37 
3 months.  38 
Sec. B -15.  17-A MRSA ยง1126 is enacted to read:  39 
 
 Page 79 - 128LR0331(01) -1 
 ยง1126.  Special sentencing provisions regarding fines for certain drug offenses  1 
1.  Fine based on val ue of scheduled drugs at time of offense.   As authorized by 2 
section 1706, subsection 3, if the State pleads and proves the value at the time of the 3 
commission of a crime of a scheduled drug that is the basis for a conviction under section 4 
1103, 1105 -A, 110 5-B, 1105 -C, 1105 -D, 1106 or 1107 -A, the convicted person may be 5 
sentenced to pay a fine in an amount up to the value, as pleaded and proved by the State, 6 
of that scheduled drug.  7 
2.  Mandatory minimum fine barring court finding exceptional circumstances.   8 
In addition to any other authorized sentencing alternative specified in section 1502, 9 
subsection 1 for individuals or section 1502, subsection 2 for organizations, the court 10 
shall impose a minimum fine of $400, none of which may be suspended, except as 11 
provided in subsection 3, for an individual convicted of a crime under section 1103; 12 
1104; 1105 -A; 1105 -B; 1105 -C; 1105 -D; 1106; 1107 -A; 1108; 1109; 1110; 1111; 13 
1111 -A, subsection 4 -A; 1116; 1117; or 1118.  14 
3.  Finding by court necessary to impose other than m inimum fine.   In the case of 15 
an individual, the court may suspend all or a portion of a minimum fine under subsection 16 
2 or impose a fine less than the minimum fine specified in subsection 2 if the court finds 17 
by a preponderance of the evidence that there a re exceptional circumstances that justify 18 
imposition of a lesser financial penalty.  In making a finding of exceptional 19 
circumstances, the court may consider:  20 
A.  Reliable evidence of financial hardship on the part of the individual and the 21 
individual's fa mily and dependents;  22 
B.  Reliable evidence of special needs of the individual or the individual's family and 23 
dependents;  24 
C.  Reliable evidence of the individual's income and future earning capacity and the 25 
individual's assets and financial resources from w hatever source;  26 
D.  Reliable evidence regarding any pecuniary gain derived from the commission of 27 
the offense; and  28 
E.  The impact of imposition of the mandatory fine on the individual's reasonable 29 
ability to pay restitution under chapter 69.  30 
Sec. B -16.  29-A MRSA ยง2412 -A, sub -ยง3, as amended by PL 2003, c. 673, Pt. 31 
TT, ยง5, is further amended to read:  32 
3.  Minimum mandatory sentences for certain suspension.   If the suspension was 33 
for OUI or an OUI offense, the court shall impose a minimum fine of $600, a term of 34 
imprisonment of 7 consecutive days and a suspension of license of not less than one year 35 
nor more than 3 years consecutive to the original suspension.  The penalties may not be 36 
suspended except as provided in subsection 3 -A. 37 
A.  If the person has a prio r conviction for violating this section within a 10 -year 38 
period and was subject to the minimum mandatory sentences, then the following 39 
minimum penalties, which may not be suspended by the court, apply in the event the 40 
suspension was for OUI:  41 
 
 Page 80 - 128LR0 331(01) -1 
 (1)  A minimum  fine of $1,000, a term of imprisonment of 30 consecutive days 1

B.  For all other suspensions, t he minimum fine for a first offense is $250, which may 11 
not be suspended by the court.  The minimum fine for 2nd and subsequent offenses is 12 
$500, which may not be suspended by the court.  13 
A separate reading of the allegation and a separate trial are not requ ired under this 14 
subsection.  15 
Sec. B -17.  29-A MRSA ยง2412 -A, sub -ยง3-A is enacted to read:  16

the Maine Criminal Code and amends other laws affected by this recodifica tion and 4 
revision accordingly.  The purpose of this bill is to reorganize certain portions of the 5 
Maine Criminal Code to be more logical and user -friendly while bringing the language 6 
into conformity with current drafting standards, clarifying current law a nd eliminating 7

A.  Allows the court to accept a plea agreement between the attorney for the State and 13 
the defendant that provides for an agreed -upon authorized sentencing alternativ e, the 14 
imposition of which is deferred;  15 
B.  Specifies that, as with the Department of Corrections, the legal authority of jails 16 
to transfer individuals from one facility to another by agreement is not impaired by 17 
the provisions of chapter 61; and  18 
C.  Subje cts to forfeiture a firearm that constitutes the basis for a conviction of 19

suspended;  30 
E.  Specifies that, unless the law that the individual is convicted of violating 31

and if the individual is eligible for probation or administrative release, a co urt may 33 
suspend the authorized term of imprisonment in whole or in part and accompany the 34 
suspension with a period of probation or administrative release.  The period of 35
