3.  Administration.   The department may administer and operate a program of aid to 4 
needy dependent children, called "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families" or 5 
"TANF," who are deprived of support or care due to the death, continued absence, 6 
physical or mental incapacity of a parent or the unemployment or underemployment of 7 
the principal wage earner  in accordance with the United States Social Security Act, as 8 
amended by PRWORA and DRA, and this Title.  9 
A.  The department shall adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer the 10 
program.  The rules must include eligibility criteria, budgetin g process, benefit 11 
calculation and confidentiality.  The confidentiality rules must ensure that 12 
confidentiality is maintained for TANF recipients at least to the same extent that 13 
confidentiality was maintained for families in the Aid to Families with Depen dent 14 
Children program unless otherwise required by federal law or regulation.  15 
B.  The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in 16 
accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 17 
this pu rpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 18 
families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance for families described in this 19 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  20 
(1)  To continue the pass -throu gh of the first $50 per month of current child 21 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 22 
tests and benefit calculations;  23 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 24 
States who are r eceiving assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  25 
Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of 26 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 27 
aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibili ty for the TANF program for these categories of 28 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 29 
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  30 
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance,  as long as that household 31 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 32 
for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 33 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pendi ng for assistance 34 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 35 
through a state -funded program unless that noncitizen is:  36 
(a)  Elderly or disabled, as described under the laws governing supplemental 37 
security income in 42 U nited States Code, Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);  38
