SUMMARY  18 
This bill, based on model legislation for accountability in economic development, 19 
makes any subsidy provided by the State or a unit of local government to a company for 20 
purposes of encouraging econ omic development subject to rescission or recapture if the 21 
company fails to meet the goals for which the subsidy was provided, such as new jobs, 22 
high wages, benefits such as health insurance and maintenance of employment levels for 23 
the duration of the subs idy or incentive period.  The bill requires the entity providing the 24 
development subsidy to monitor the company receiving the subsidy to ensure the 25 
company is meeting the goals for the subsidy and to recapture all or a portion of the 26 
subsidy from a company  that does not meet those goals.  27 
This bill requires the entity providing the subsidy to maintain a publicly accessible 28 
website containing information about the subsidy and the company receiving the subsidy 29 
and any enforcement actions taken against a compan y receiving a subsidy.  Finally, this 30 
bill provides so -called taxpayer standing to a taxpayer or organization of taxpayers to 31 
allow suit to be brought by that taxpayer or organization to enforce the rescission or 32 
recapture requirements.  33
