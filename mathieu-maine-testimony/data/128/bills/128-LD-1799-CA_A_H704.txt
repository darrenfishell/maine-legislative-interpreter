3. Add in section 2 of the rule a definition of "directly interconnected" to clarify that

transport electric power across the transmission and distribution utility's electric plant; 
4. Add in section 2 of the rule a definition of "service territory" to clarify that it refers

provide service based on a finding of need by the Public Utilities Commission or a 
legislative finding of need; 
5. Clarify in section 3, paragraph A of the rule'that a transmission and distribution 
utility may not have an affiliate that owns generation or generation-related assets that are

distribution utility or if the point of interconnection of generation or generation-related 
assets of the affiliate is within the service territory of the transmission and distribution 
utility; 
6. Add in section 4 of the rule a general standard that explicitly prohibits preferential, 
discriminatory or other anticompetitive conduct by a transmission and distribution utility; 
7. Clarify in section 4, subsection O of the rule that access to books and records is 
for the purpose of verifying compliance with the standards of conduct and that access to 
such books and records also applies to books and records that predate an affiliated 
generator's becoming subject to the rule; and 
8. Clarify in section 7 of the rule that the training of employees to ensure compliance 
with the rule is limited to those employees that have access or may have access to the 
types of confidential information that is not to be shared. 
The Public Utilities Commission is not required to hold hearings or undertake further 
proceedings prior to final adoption of the rule in accordance with this section.'
