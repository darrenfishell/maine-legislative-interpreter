Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
This amendment removes meat and meat products, poultry and poultry products and fish and fish products from the 
definition of "farm food product" and limits the number of events that may be defined as a "traditional community 
social event". The removal of certain products from the definition of a "farm food product" would subject the 
producers of those products to the licensing requirements of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry. Revenue from issuing these licenses will increase General Fund revenue by a minor amount.
