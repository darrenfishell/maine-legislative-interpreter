19 authority to be used solely for investment in the Maine  potato industry.  The fund must be 
20 administered by the Maine Potato Board, established in Title 36, section  4603 and 
21 referred to in this section as "the board," and the Potato Marketing Improvement Fund  
22 Committee, established  in Title 5, section 12004-H, subsection 10-A.  All money  
23 received by the authority  from any source for the development and implementation  of 
24 improved storage,  packing and marketing and programs and activities that improve  the 
25 economic viability of the potato industry must  be credited  to the fund.  Any money  
26 credited to the fund from the issuance of bonds on behalf of the State for agricultural 
27 development may be used only for the purposes  of state loans  as prescribed by Title 7, 
28 section 974-A to provide assistance  to potato farmers  for the design, construction, 
29 improvement, support and operation of storage, packing and marketing facilities; for 
30 programs and activities  that improve the economic viability  of the potato industry; and to 
31 pay the administrative costs of processing loan applications and servicing  and 
32 administering the fund and loans  and grants made therein, to the extent that the costs 
33 exceed the fee for administrative  costs established by Title 7, section 974-A, subsection 2 
34 2-A.  At the discretion  of the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 
35 the authority shall make payments directly to the board,  which shall use those payments  
36 to implement the requirements of this section.  During any period that the commissioner  
37 has authorized direct payments from the authority to the board, the authority shall make  
38 written annual  reports to the commissioner and the joint standing committee  of the 
39 Legislature having jurisdiction over agriculture, conservation  and forestry matters  
40 detailing the amounts of payments  to the board and the dates payments were  made and 
41 detailing the expenditure of those payments.  Repayment of the loans and interest on the 
Page 2 - 128LR2828(01)-11 loans must be credited to the fund to be available for making additional  state loans  for the 
2 same purposes, except that any interest earned  on the cash balance  of the fund may be 
3 used for the grants  authorized by Title 7, section  975-A.  In order to provide  additional  
4 amounts for loans, the commissioner, upon consultation with the board,  may take such 
5 actions and enter into such agreements as may be necessary  to sell or assign up to 
6 $2,000,000 in the aggregate principal amount of loans and undivided interests in a pool of 
7 loans and assign  or pledge any mortgage  or other security to the authority, under the 
8 terms and conditions the commissioner considers advisable upon consultation with the 
9 board.  The assignment and related transactions  may not result  in indebtedness of the 
10 State.  The proceeds of the sale or assignment  must  be credited to the fund and used for 
11 the purposes authorized  in this section.

14 Improvement Fund  from a fixed rate of 5% to the federal prime rate at the time of loan
