128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
HOUSE AMENDMENT ::J3 "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 551, 
L.D. 1573, Bill, "An Act To Encourage Development in the Logging Industry by 
Requiring State and Local Government Agencies To Give Preference to Lumber and 
Solid Wood Products Harvested in the State" 
Amend the amendment in the 9th paragraph after the substitute title in the first 5 lines 
(page 1, lines 33 and 34 and page 2, lines 1 to 3 in amendment) by striking out the first 
sentence and inse1iing the following: 'Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 
contrary, and to the extent consistent with federal law, if the State provides a subsidy to a 
landowner . who sells timber harvested from the landowner's land in this State, the 
landowner shall use an in-state contractor to harvest and transport that timber, as long as 
the price and quality of the work perfmmed by that in-state contractor is equal to that of a 
contractor from outside the State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the requirement that a person who receives a subsidy from 
the State and who purchases timber give preference to timber harvested by an in-state 
contractor. Instead this amendment requires a landowner who receives a subsidy from 
the State and who sells timber harvested from the landowner's land in this State to use an 
in-state contractor for the harvesting and transportation of that timber, as long as the price 
and quality of the work performed by that in-state contractor is equal to the price and 
quality of work performe by a contractor from outside the State.
