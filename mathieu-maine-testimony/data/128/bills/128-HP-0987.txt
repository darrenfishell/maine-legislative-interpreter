JOINT RESOLUTION MAKING APPLICATION TO THE CONGRESS  OF THE UNITED 
STATES FOR CALLING A CONVENTION TO PROPOSE AMENDMEN TS TO THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES TO LIMIT THE POWE R OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT 
 
 WHEREAS,  executive orders by the President of the United Sta tes have become a vehicle 
through which the President may overstep the limits  of the President's constitutional authority; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the concentration of power at the federal level has  had the effect of making 
federal officials less responsive to the will of th e people and more readily influenced by lobbyists, 
wealthy corporations and special interests in Washi ngton, D.C.; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  much of federal law is now made by federal bureaucr ats who were never chosen 
by the people and have no accountability to the peo ple whatsoever; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  policy decisions made at the state level tend to be  more responsive to the needs 
and desires of the people; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the Federal Government has created a crushing natio nal debt through improper 
and imprudent spending; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the Federal Government has invaded the legitimate r oles of the states through 
the manipulative process of federal mandates, many of which are unfunded to a great extent; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the states have the ability to restore the responsi veness of government to the 
people and to restrain abuses of federal power by p roposing amendments to the United States 
Constitution through a limited convention of the st ates under Article V; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  under the United States Constitution, Article V, th e Congress of the United 
States, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall de em it necessary, shall propose amendments to the 
United States Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several 
states, shall call a convention for proposing amend ments that, in either case, shall be valid to all 
intents and purposes, as part of the United States Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of 
three-fourths of the several states, or by conventi ons in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the oth er 
mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congres s; now, therefore, be it
