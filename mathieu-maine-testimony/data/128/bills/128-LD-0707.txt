SUMMARY  16 
This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 17 
vehicles and camper trailers registered in the State.  18 
With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles and buses and special 19 
mobile equipment, current law requires that the excise tax be based upon the maker's list 20 
price for the motor vehicle; the excise tax on certain commercial motor vehicles and 21 
buses and special mobile equipment is based on the purchase price.  22 
This bill requires that the excise tax for all motor vehicles and camper trailers be 23 
based upon the purchase p rice of the vehicle.  Either the original bill of sale or the state 24 
sales tax document may be used to verify the purchase price.  25
