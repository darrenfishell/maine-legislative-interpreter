circumstances that do not constitute murder because the person cau ses the death 8 
while under the influence of extreme anger or extreme fear brought about by 9 
adequate provocation.  Adequate provocation has the same meaning as in section 10 
201, subsection 4.  The fact that the person causes the death while under the influence  11 
of extreme anger or extreme fear brought about by adequate provocation constitutes a 12 
mitigating circumstance reducing murder to manslaughter and need not be proved in 13 
any prosecution initiated under this subsection.  Violation of this paragraph is a Class  14 
A crime; or 15 
C.  Has direct and personal management or control of any employment, place of 16 
employment or other employee, and intentionally or knowingly violates any 17

foreseeable consequence of the violation.  This paragraph does not apply to:  20 
(1)  Any person who performs a public function either on a volunteer basis or for 21 
minimal compensati on for services rendered; or  22 
(2)  Any public employee responding to or acting at a life -threatening situation 23 
who is forced to make and does make a judgment reasonably calculated to save 24 
the life of a human being.  25

D.  Trafficks in a drug with or furnishes a drug to another person in violation of 27 
chapter 45 and the other person dies as a result of injecting, inhaling or ingesting the 28

contributed to the decedent's death by the decedent's purposeful, knowing, reckless or 30 
negligent injection, inhalation or ingestion of the drug or by the decedent's consenting 31 
to the administration of the drug by another. Violation of this paragra ph is a Class A 32 
crime.  33
