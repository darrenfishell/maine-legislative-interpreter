32 SUMMARY 
33 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
34 amends the State's mining laws as follows. 
3 5 1. It prohibits the issuance of a mining lease under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
36 12, chapter 201-A, subchapter 3 if the proposed mining operation is to be wholly or 
3 7 partially located in, on or under any designated land, state historic site, state park, public 
3 8 reserved land, submerged land or state-owned wildlife management area or the Allagash 
39 Wilderness Waterway. The amendment also prohibits the issuance of a mining permit 
40 under the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act, referred to in this summary as the "Mining 
41 Act," if any part of the mining operation will be located wholly or partially in, on or 
42 under any of the same state lands.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITIEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 265, L.D. 820 
1 2. It adds to the Mining Act definitions for the terms "dry stack tailings 
2 management," "mine shaft," "mine waste," "mine waste unit," "open-pit mining" and "wet 
3 mine waste unit," and it amends the existing definition for the term ''tailings 
4 impoundment." 
5 3. It amends the rule-making authority of the Department of Environmental 
6 Protection under the Mining Act to require that any rule or rule change proposed by the 
7 department in accordance with its authority under the Mining Act may not be finally 
8 adopted by the department unless legislation authorizing final adoption of such rules is 
9 enacted into law. 
10 4. It amends permit approval conditions under the Mining Act relating to discharges 
11 causing groundwater contamination by allowing only for limited contamination of 
12 groundwater within a mining area that does not result in contamination of groundwater 
13 beyond the mining area; contamination of groundwater within the mining area that 
14 exceeds certain water quality criteria for pollutants; contamination of groundwater within 
15 the mining area due to pH or metals that exceeds limits set forth in the mining permit 
16 based on site-specific geologic and hydrologic characteristics; any violation of surface 
17 water quality standards; or, if groundwater or surface water quality within the mining area 
18 prior to the commencement of mining activity exceeds applicable water quality standards, 
19 further degradation of such groundwater or surface water quality. The amendment also 
20 provides a narrow definition of the term "mining area" applicable only to this provision 
21 on discharges causing groundwater contamination. 
22 5. It prohibits the placement of mining operations under the Mining Act involving 
23 the removal of metallic minerals, the storage of metallic minerals or mine waste, the 
24 processing of metallic minerals or the treatment of mine waste in or on a flood plain or a 
25 flood hazard area. 
26 6. It prohibits the removal of metallic minerals in, on or from a river, stream or 
27 brook, a great pond, a freshwater wetland or a coastal wetland. 
28 7. It prohibits the placement of a mine shaft in, on or under a significant or 
29 outstanding river segment, an outstanding river, a high or moderate value waterfowl and 
30 wading bird habitat, a great pond or a coastal wetland. 
31 8. It requires the use of dry stack tailings management and prohibits the use of wet 
32 mine waste units or tailings impoundments for the management of mine waste and 
3 3 tailings. 
34 9. It prohibits open-pit mining. 
35 10. It clarifies the financial assurance provisions in the Mining Act and requires an 
36 applicant for a permit or a permittee under the Mining Act to provide special financial 
37 assurance coverage for a worst-case catastrophic mining event or failure. 
38 11. It authorizes, subject to the incorporation of specified amendments, final 
39 adoption of Chapter 200: Metallic Mineral Exploration, Advanced Exploration and 
40 Mining, a major substantive rule of the Department of Environmental Protection that was 
41 submitted to the Legislature for review pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill authorizes final adoption of Department of Enviromnental Protection (DEP) mining rules if certain changes 
are made to the rule. DEP's costs related to making changes to the rule are expected to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. DEP may incur costs in the future related to approving applicants for a mining 
pennit and engaging in certain oversight activities. The extent of costs to DEP will depend on the number of 
applicants and the activities they engage in, but these costs are expected to be covered by mining fees. Under cunent 
statute, applicants are required to pay an initial processing fee not to exceed $500,000 and an annual license fee 
between $20,000 and $50,000 that will be directed to the Metallic Mining Fund within DEP. No estimate is made at 
this time on the number of mining applicants. Any additional costs to the Maine Land Use Planning Commission for 
rulemaking are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
If applicants are approved, mining excise tax revenues would be received. Under cunent statute, the revenue would 
reimburse municipalities and unorganized tenitories for at least 50%, and if sufficiently available 100%, of the 
property tax revenue loss suffered by that municipality or unorganized territo1y as a result of property tax exemptions 
created under the mining excise tax statute. 25% of any remaining revenues would be paid to DEP for oversight of 
mining activity and 75% would be deposited to the General Fund. No estimate has been made at this time of the 
amount of mining excise tax revenues that might be generated.
