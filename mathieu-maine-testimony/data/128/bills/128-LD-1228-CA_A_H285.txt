SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, revises the substance 
of the bill to provide that a school administrative unit is required to make both 
extracurricular and cocurricular activities available to a student enrolled in a public 
charter school who is eligible to attend a school of that school administrative unit, 
including a student who resides in the unorganized territory. The amendment defines 
"eligible student." 
The amendment provides that an eligible student is eligible to participate in 
cocurricular activities sponsored by the school administrative unit upon approval of the 
principal or the principal's designee, which may not unreasonably be withheld. The 
student must comply with the applicable behavioral, disciplinary and other rules 
governing regularly enrolled students participating in the activities. 
Like the bill, the amendment provides that an eligible student is eligible to try out for 
extracurricular activities sponsored by the local school unit on the same basis as a student 
receiving homeschool instruction may do under current law. The amendment adds a 
requirement that the student pay the same fees as regularly enrolled students participating 
in the activity pay. The local school unit may not impose any eligibility standards for 
participation in extracurricular activities by an eligible student that are not imposed on all 
other students. 
The amendment also provides that, if an eligible student participates in cocurricular 
or extracurricular activities, the public charter school in which the eligible student is 
enrolled is required to pay to the local school unit the amount of the EPS per-pupil 
funding received by the public charter school for cocurricular and extracurricular

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Requiring local school administrative units (SAU's) to allow eligible students enrolled in a public charter school to 
participate in its extracurricular and cocurricular activities under certain conditions will have no fiscal impact to the 
State. The fiscal impact to local SAU's and the public charter schools in which the eligible students attend as a result 
of the public charter school being required to pay the local SAU the BPS-per-pupil funding received by the public 
charter school for cocurricular and extracurricular activities can not be determined and will depend on the number of 
eligible students in a public charter school that choose to participate in a SAU's extracurricular and cocurricular 
activities.
