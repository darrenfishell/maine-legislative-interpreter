C, §2, is repealed.  8 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3132, sub -§2-D is enacted to read:  9 
2-D.  Nontransmission  alternatives investigation.   In considering whether to 10 
approve or disapprove all or portions of a proposed transmission line pursuant to 11 
subsection 5, the commission shall consider the results of an investigation by an 12 
independent 3rd party, which may be the commission or a contractor selected by the 13 
commission, of nontransmission alternatives to construction of the proposed transmission 14 
line.  The investigation must set forth the total projected costs of the transmission line as 15 
well as the total projecte d costs of the alternatives over the effective life of the proposed 16 
transmission line.  17 
SUMMARY  18 
This bill changes the timing of the nontransmission alternatives investigation required 19 
for proposed transmission line projects.  The bill requires the investiga tion to be done 20 
during the course of the proceeding to consider the petition for approval of a proposed 21 
transmission line instead of being done prior to filing that petition.  22
