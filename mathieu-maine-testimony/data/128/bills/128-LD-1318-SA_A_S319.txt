This amendment makes adjustments to Highway Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to reverse the 
effects of two initiatives that were inadvertently included in Part A of the Highway Fund Budget, LD 1440, now 
chaptered as PL 2017, c. 283. This amendment deallocates Highway Fund allocations to the Department of Secretary 
of State of $51,059 annually beginning in fiscal year 2017-18. It also adds back Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocations to the Department of Transportation of $1,000,000 annually beginning in fiscal year 2017-18.
