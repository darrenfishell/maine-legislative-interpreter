 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the budgets of counties are important undertakings requiring the 3 
participation of represen tatives of municipalities throughout the county; and  4 
Whereas, when a vacancy occurs in a county budget committee, it reduces the 5 
ability of the budget committee to adequately represent all of its constituents and makes 6 
the task of creating a county budget  more difficult; and  7 
Whereas, county budget committees need adequate and prompt mechanisms to fill a 8 
vacancy when a municipality of a vacating member is unwilling or unable to fill the 9 
vacancy so that the budget committee can timely and efficiently produc e a budget 10 
representing the interests of the entire county; and  11 
Whereas, there may be a need to replace committee members before the next 12 
budget cycle; and  13 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 14 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 15 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 16 
therefore,  17 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  18 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §853, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 737, Pt. A, §2 and 19 
Pt. C, §106 and amended by PL 1989, c. 6; c. 9, §2; and c. 104, Pt. C, §§8 and 10, is 20 
further amended to read:  21 
4.  Vacancies.   A vacancy occurring on the budget committee shall  must  be filled by 22 
the committ ee for the balance of the unexpired term.  The person appointed to fill the 23 
vacant office must be a municipal officer from the same municipality as the person 24 
vacating the office.  If the municipality of the person vacating the office declines to send 25 
a new member, the committee may solicit another municipality in the same district as the 26 
municipality of the vacating member that does not have a member sitting on the 27 
committee to send a municipal officer to fill the vacancy.  28 
Emergency clause.  In view of the  emergency cited in the preamble, this 29 
legislation takes effect when approved.  30

providing that when a vacancy on the committee occurs and the municipality of the 33

another municipality in the district that does not have a member currently sitting on the 35
