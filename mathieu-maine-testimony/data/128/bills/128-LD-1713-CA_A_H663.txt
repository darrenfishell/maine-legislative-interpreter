The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $1,542,416 
beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 to allow a participant in the Bridging Rental Assistance Program to contribute the 
same amount toward rent that is required of a pa11icipant in the housing voucher program administered by the United 
States Depm1ment of Housing and Urban Development under the United States Housing Act of 1937, Public Law 75-
412, 50 Stat. 888, Section 8. Currently, pat1icipants contribute more than what is required in the federal program and 
reducing the participant share will require the State to make up the difference.
