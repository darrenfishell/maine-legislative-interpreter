levels; and  6

Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 10

therefore,  13 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  14 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §2604, as enacted by PL 1975, c. 751, §4, is amended to read:  15

SUMMARY  6 
Current law requires schools that take drinking water from sources other than public 7 
water systems to have that water tested.  This bill requires schools that take drinking 8 
water from public water systems t o have the same tests performed on that water, except 9 
that school buildings less than 10 years old are exempt from this requirement.  Under the 10 
bill, after receiving results of school water tests, the Department of Education must make 11 
the results available  to the public.  The Department of Health and Human Services must 12 
make test results from nursery schools available to the public.  13
