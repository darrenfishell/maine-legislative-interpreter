6 12-B.  Autocycles.   The Secretary  of State  may issue a registration for an autocycle 
7 upon application  and payment of an annual fee of $21.  The registrant  must  provide a 
8 certificate of title required  by section  651, proof of financial  responsibility required by 
9 section 1601 and evidence of payment of the excise  tax as required by Title  36, section  
10 1482, subsection 1, paragraph C.  An autocycle registered under this section is issued a
