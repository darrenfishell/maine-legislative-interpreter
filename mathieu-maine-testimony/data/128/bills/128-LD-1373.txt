SUMMARY  36 
This bill amends the laws go verning net energy billing.  It prohibits a charge to a 37 
customer that elects to use net energy billing.  It provides specific provisions related to 38 
net energy billing including:  39 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR1071(01) -1 
 1. It provides that customers using net energy billing receive bill credits ne tted 1 
against delivery and supply charges on a one -to-one basis;  2 
2. It provides that unused bill credits accumulate on a 12 -month rolling basis;  3 
3. It limits the installed capacity of an eligible facility to 2 megawatts in the territory 4 
of an investor -owned  transmission and distribution utility and to 100 kilowatts in the 5 
territory of a consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility, except that the 6 
consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility may elect to allow an eligible 7 
facility with instal led capacity up to 2 megawatts;  8 
4. It allows an eligible facility with shared ownership or 3rd -party ownership to be 9 
eligible for net energy billing and prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from limiting 10 
the number of participants in a shared ownershi p project, but allows the commission to 11 
set a minimum share size; and  12 
5. It requires a comprehensive review of ratepayer benefits and costs from net 13 
energy billing when any investor -owned transmission and distribution utility in the State 14 
enters into net e nergy billing agreements for a total generating capacity equal to 5% of 15 
the annual peak demand and again for every additional 3% of the utility's annual peak 16 
demand thereafter.  17 
This bill also establishes a solar energy rebate program to be administered by the 18 
Efficiency Maine Trust. The program is to be funded through an assessment collected by 19 
the Public Utilities Commission from transmission and distribution utilities. Available 20 
funds are to be distributed in the following manner: 40% to eligible commerci al 21 
customers, 20% to low -income or moderate -income residents and 40% to other eligible 22 
residents.  This bill requires the trust to adopt routine technical rules to administer the 23 
program and requires the trust to submit an annual report to the Legislature that describes 24 
the actions of the trust related to the rebate program.  25
