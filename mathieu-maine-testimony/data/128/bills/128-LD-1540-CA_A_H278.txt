FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 1061, L.D. 1540, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Consumers' Freedom of Choice in Auto Collision Repairs" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA §2164-C, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 101, §1, is 
amended to read: 
2. Appraisals or repairs to motor vehicles for collision damage. A domestic or 
foreign insurer or its agent or employee may not require, directly or indirectly, that 
appraisals or repairs to motor vehicles with collision damage be made or not be made in a 
specified place of business. 
A domestic or foreign insurer or its agent or employee may not contract with any person 
to act as its agent for purposes of managing, handling or an-anging repair or replacement 
of motor vehicles for collision damage when that person is compensated by payment of a 
portion of the difference between the list price of the product or services provided and the 
amount paid to the person providing repair and replacement service. 
A domestic or foreign insurer or its agent or employee may not recommend the use of a 
particular motor vehicle repair service or network of repair services without informing the 
claimant that the claimant is under no obligation to use the recommended repair service 
or network of repair services. If a domestic or foreign insurer or its agent or employee 
recommends the use of a particular motor vehicle repair service or network of repair 
services, the following advisory must be made to the insured or claimant at the time a 
claim for motor vehicle collision damage is reported: 
"You have the legal right to choose a motor vehicle collision repair shop to fix your 
vehicle. Your policy will cover the reasonable costs of repairing your vehicle to its pre­
accident condition no matter where you have repairs made."'
