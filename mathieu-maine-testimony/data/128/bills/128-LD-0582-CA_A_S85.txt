FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 197, L.D. 582, Bill, "An Act To 
Provide for the Comprehensive Medical, Dental, Educational and Behavioral Assessment 
of Children Entering State Custody" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Provide for Timely Physical Examinations of Children Entering State 
Custody' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง4063-A, sub-ยง1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 194, is amended 
to read: 
1. Physical examination required. The department shall ensure that a child ordered 
into its custody receives an appointment for a medical examination by a licensed 
physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner within -l-0 l working days after the 
department's custody of the child commences and that the medical examination takes 
place within 10 working days after the department's custody of the child commences.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the 
requirement for a comprehensive medical, dental, educational and mental health 
assessment of a child entering the custody of the Department of Health and Human 
Services that is in the bill. It retains the shortening of the time requirement for an 
appointment to be made for a medical examination from 10 days to 3 days but adds a 
requirement that the examination must take place within 10 days of the child's entering 
custody. It also changes the title.
