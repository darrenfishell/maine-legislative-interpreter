 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §13157 -A, sub -§6, ¶H, as amended by PL 2007, c. 33, §1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
H.  Notwithstanding paragraphs A to G, an ATV may be operated on the extreme 4 
right of a publi c way or as directed by the appropriate governmental unit within the 5 
public way of a municipality or an unorganized or unincorporated township if the 6 
appropriate governmental unit has designated the public way as an ATV -access route.  7 
An ATV must travel in  the same direction as motor vehicle traffic on a public way 8 
designated as an ATV -access route.  A public way designated by an appropriate 9 
governmental unit as an ATV -access route must be posted conspicuously at regular 10 
intervals by that governmental unit with highly visible signs designating the ATV - 11 
access route.  Before designating a public way as an ATV -access route, the 12 
appropriate governmental unit shall make appropriate determinations that ATV travel 13 
on the extreme right of the public way or as direct ed by the appropriate governmental 14 
unit within the public way may be conducted safely and will not interfere with 15 
vehicular traffic on the public way.  For purposes of this paragraph, "appropriate 16 
governmental unit" means the Department of Transportation, county commissioners 17 
or municipal officers within their respective jurisdictions.  The jurisdiction of each 18 
appropriate governmental unit over public ways pursuant to this paragraph is the 19 
same as its jurisdiction over the passage of vehicles on public way s pursuant to Title 20 
29-A, section 2395.  Municipal or county law enforcement officials having 21 
jurisdiction have primary enforcement authority over any route established under this 22 
paragraph.  A person may not operate an ATV for more than 500 yards on a pub lic 23 
way designated as an ATV -access route unless the person possesses a valid driver's 24 
license under Title 29 -A, chapter 11 and the person maintains liability insurance for 25 
the ATV comparable to the required liability insurance under Title 29 -A, chapter 13 , 26 
subchapter 2 for a motor vehicle.  27 
SUMMARY  28 
This bill requires an operator of an all -terrain vehicle who travels more than 500 29 
yards on a public way designated as an ATV -access route to possess a valid driver's 30 
license and motor vehicle liability insurance  for the ATV.  31
