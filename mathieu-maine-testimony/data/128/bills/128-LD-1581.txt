is a partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership, the taxpayer must 41 
subtract the taxpayer's distributive share of the gain, subject to the percentage 42 
limitations provided in this paragraph.  43

 (3)  Taxpayers claiming this credit must attach a sworn statement from a forester 1 
licensed pursuant to Title 32, chapter 76 that the timberlands for which the credit 2 
is claimed have been managed sustainably.  For the purposes of this 3 
subparagraph, "sustainably" means that the timberlands for which the credit is 4 
claimed have been managed to protect soil productivity and to maintain or 5 
improve stand productivity and timbe r quality; known occurrences of threatened 6 
or endangered species and rare or exemplary natural communities; significant 7 
wildlife habitat and essential wildlife habitat; and water quality, wetlands and 8 
riparian zones.  9 
Upon request of the State Tax Assessor,  the Director of the Bureau of Forestry 10 
within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may provide 11 
assistance in determining whether timberlands for which the credit is claimed 12 
have been managed sustainably.  When assistance is requested u nder this 13 
subparagraph, the director or the director's designee may enter and examine the 14 
timberlands for the purpose of determining whether the timberlands have been 15 
managed sustainably.  16 
In the case of timberlands owned by an entity that is treated as a p ass-through entity 17 
for income tax purposes, the land must be treated as eligible timberland if ownership 18 
and use of the land by the pass -through entity satisfies the requirements of this 19 
paragraph.  If the owner of the eligible timberlands is an S corporat ion, the taxpayer 20 
must subtract the owner's pro rata share of the gain.  If the owner of the timberlands 21 
is a partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership, the taxpayer must 22 
subtract the taxpayer's distributive share of the gain, subject  to the percentage 23 
limitations provided in this paragraph.  24 
This modification may not reduce Maine taxable income to less than zero.  To the 25 
extent this modification results in Maine taxable income that is less than zero for the 26 
taxable year, the excess neg ative modification amount may be carried forward and 27 
applied as a subtraction modification for up to 10 taxable years.  The entire amount of 28 
the excess negative modification must be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to 29 
which, by reason of this s ubsection, the negative modification may be carried and 30 
then to each of the other taxable years to the extent the unused negative modification 31 
is not used for a prior taxable year.  Earlier carry -forward modifications must be used 32 
before newer modification s generated in later years .  Except for unused modifications 33 
carried forward to subsequent tax years, the subtraction modification allowed under 34 
this paragraph does not apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017 ; 35
