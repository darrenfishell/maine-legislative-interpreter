JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING SUNSHINE WEEK, MARCH 1 2-18, 2017 
 
 WHEREAS,  James Madison, generally regarded as the father of our federal Constitution, 
wrote that "a people who mean to be their own Gover nors, must arm themselves with the power 
which knowledge gives"; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  every citizen in our participatory democracy has an  inherent right of access 
to government meetings and public records; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  an open and accessible government is vital to estab lishing and maintaining 
the people's trust and confidence in their governme nt and in the government's ability to 
effectively serve its citizens; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  we celebrate open government and recognize its impo rtance in developing 
how people who believe in democracy think about tra nsparency and its role in government, 
leading to the adoption of our own Freedom of Acces s Act; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the protection of every person's right of access to  public records and 
government meetings is a high priority for the Stat e of Maine; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  Sunshine Week was established to spark a discussion  about the importance 
of open government and public access to government documents and meetings; now, therefore, 
be it 
 
 RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature 
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on beha lf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to recognize Sunshine Week during the w eek of March 12-18, 2017 and confirm the 
basic principles of an open and accessible governme nt in a free society and urge all citizens to 
join in this observance.
