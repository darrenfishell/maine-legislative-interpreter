Page 1 - 128LR2989(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  34-B MRSA §3801,  sub-§4-A,  ¶D, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 651, §4, is 
3 amended to read:
4 D.  For the purposes of section 3873-A, in In view of the person's  treatment history, 
5 current behavior and inability  to make an informed  decision, a reasonable likelihood 
6 that the person's  mental health will deteriorate  and that the person will in the 
7 foreseeable future pose a likelihood of serious harm  as defined in paragraphs 
8 paragraph A, B or C.
9 SUMMARY
10 Under current  law, for the purpose of admission to a progressive treatment program  a 
11 determination that a person  poses a likelihood of serious  harm takes into consideration 
12 the likelihood  that a person's mental health will deteriorate  and that the person  will in the 
13 foreseeable future  pose a likelihood  of serious harm.   This bill expands  the definition of 
14 "likelihood of serious harm" to apply those  same  considerations for purposes other than 
15 admission to a progressive treatment program.
