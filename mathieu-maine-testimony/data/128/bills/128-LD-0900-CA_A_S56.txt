COMMITIEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 302, L.D. 900 
1 individual or group coverage for dental services executed or renewed on or after January 
2 1, 2018.' 
3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment is the minority report of the committee and replaces most of the bill. 
5 Like the bill, the amendment prohibits insurers and health maintenance organizations 
6 offering individual and group coverage from limiting dental fees that are not covered by 
7 the insurer. The amendment also adds a definition of "covered service" to clarify that a 
8 dental provider must charge the contracted fee for a service that a health plan or dental 
9 plan would be obligated to pay but for the application of contractual limitations such as 
10 deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, waiting periods, annual or lifetime maximums, 
11 frequency limitations, alternative benefit payments or any other limitations. 
12 The amendment changes the term "dentist" to "dental provider" with the intent to 
13 include independent practice dental hygienists and dental hygiene therapists as well as 
14 dentists. 
15 The amendment also eliminates references in the bill that appear to permit balance 
16 billing of a patient. 
17 The amendment applies to contracts executed or renewed on or after January 1, 2018.
