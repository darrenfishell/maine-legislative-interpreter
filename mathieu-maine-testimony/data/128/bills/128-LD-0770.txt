 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง4316 -A is enacted to read:  2 
ยง4316 -A.  Coverage of services provided by federally qualified health center in 3 
schools  4 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the cont ext otherwise indicates, the 5 
following terms have the following meanings.  6 
A.  "Federally qualified health center" means a center that provides preventive 7 
primary health care services and is receiving a grant under Section 330 of the federal 8 
Public Health S ervice Act, 42 United States Code, Section 254b.  9 
B.  "School -based health center" is a facility located in a school building or on school 10 
grounds in this State that provides comprehensive primary health care services.  11 
2.  Coverage.  A carrier offering a h ealth plan in this State may not deny coverage on 12 
the basis that the coverage is delivered in a school -based health center operating under a 13 
contract with a federally qualified health center if the health care service would be 14 
covered if it were provided i n the federally qualified health center.  Coverage for health 15 
care services provided in a school -based health center must be determined in a manner 16 
consistent with coverage for health care services provided in a federally qualified health 17 
center.  A carrie r may offer a health plan containing a provision for a deductible, 18 
copayment or coinsurance requirement for a health care service provided in a school - 19 
based health center as long as the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed 20 
the deductible, c opayment or coinsurance applicable to services provided in a federally 21 
qualified health center.  22 
SUMMARY  23 
This bill prohibits health insurance carriers from denying coverage for services 24 
delivered in a school setting under a contract with a federally qualifi ed health center if the 25 
same services would be covered if provided at the federally qualified health center.  26
