COMMITTEE AMENDMENT “  B” to H.P. 281, L.D. 390  
 
 Page 629 - 128LR2175(03) -1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT  the state average per public secondary student cost as adjusted, whichever is lower, plus 1 
an insured value factor.  The insured value factor is computed by dividing 5% of the 2 
insured value of school b uildings and equipment by the average number of pupils 3 
enrolled in the school on October 1st and April 1st of the year immediately before the 4 
school year for which the tuition charge is computed.  From school year 2009 -2010 to 5 
school year 2013 -2014, a scho ol administrative unit is not required to pay an insured 6 
value factor greater than 5% of the school's tuition rate or $500 per student, whichever is 7 
less, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to authorize its 8 
school board to pay a higher insured value factor that is no greater than 10% of the 9 
school’s tuition rate per student.  For the 2014 -2015 school year, a school administrative 10 
unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than 6% of the school's tuition 11 
rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes to 12 
authorize its school board to pay a higher insured value factor that is no greater than 10% 13 
of the school's tuition rate per student.  Beginning in the 2015 -2016 school ye ar, a school 14 
administrative unit is not required to pay an insured value factor greater than the amount 15 
of the prior school year's insured value factor adjusted by a percentage equal to the 16 
percentage change in the state share percentage of the total cost of funding public 17 
education in the prior school year as determined by section 15671, subsection 7, 18 
paragraph C D as compared to the applicable percentage for the current school year.  In 19 
no case may the insured value factor be less than 6% or greater than 10% of the school's 20 
tuition rate per student, unless the legislative body of the school administrative unit votes 21 
to authorize its school board to pay an insured value factor that exceeds the amount 22 
otherwise permitted by this subsection by no more than 5%  of the school's tuition rate per 23 
student.  For the 2013 -2014 school year only, the maximum allowable tuition charged to 24 
a school administrative unit by a private school that participates in the Maine Public 25 
Employees Retirement System must be increased ab ove the amount otherwise permitted 26 
under this section by an amount equal to the calculated normal cost of teacher retirement 27 
for that school divided by the number of enrolled students as of October 1, 2012.  28

B.  Subject to paragraph A, an employer's contribution rate for the 12 -month period 30 
commencing Janua ry 1st of each year is based upon the employer's experience rating 31 
record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.  The employer's reserve 32 
ratio is the percent obtained by dividing the amount, if any, by which the employer's 33 
contributions, credite d from the time the employer first or most recently became an 34 
employer, whichever date is later, up to and including June 30th of the preceding 35 
year, including any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or 36 
before July 31st of that y ear, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same 37 
period, by the employer's average annual payroll for the period of 36 consecutive 38 
months ending June 30th of the preceding year.  The employer's contribution rate is 39 
determined under subparagraphs  (1) to (8).  40 
 (1)  The commissioner shall prepare a schedule listing all employers for whom a 41 
reserve ratio has been computed pursuant to this paragraph, in the order of their 42 
reserve ratios, beginning with the highest ratio.  For each employer, the schedu le 43

(4)  The commissioner shall compute the predetermined yield by mul tiplying the 18 
ratio of total wages to taxable wages for the preceding calendar year by the 19 
planned yield.  20 
(5)  The commissioner shall determine the contribution rates effective for a rate 21 
year by multiplying the predetermined yield by the experience factors  for each 22 
contribution category.  Contribution category 20 in the table in subparagraph (2) 23 
must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%.  The employer's experience 24 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) that 25 
corresponds with the employer's contribution category in column A, except that 26 
the experience factors in column E must be used to determine the contribution 27 
rates for rate years 2000 and 2001 and those in column D must be used for rate 28 
years 2002 and 2003.  Beginning January 1, 2018, for rate years when schedule A 29 
is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3 -A), the experience factor in 30 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of 31 
0.00 in column C.  32 
(6)  If, subsequent to the assignment of contribution rates for a rate year, the 33 
reserve ratio of an employer is recomputed and changed, the employer must be 34 
placed in the position on the schedule prepared pursuant to subparagraph (1) that 35 
the employer would have occupied had th e corrected reserve ratio been shown on 36 
the schedule.  The altered position on the schedule does not affect the position of 37 
any other employer.  38 
(7)  In computing the contribution rates, only the wages reported by employers 39 
liable for payment of contributio ns into the fund and net benefits paid that are 40 
charged to an employer's experience rating record or to the fund are considered in 41 
the computation of the average benefit cost rate and the ratio of total wages to 42 
taxable wages.  43  A B C
