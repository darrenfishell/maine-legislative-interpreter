This amendment changes the timing of the notice required in Committee Amendment 
11A11 regarding a property owner's right to apply for an abatement and the availability of 
assistance so that the notice need not be issued separately and instead must be included 
with other notice to that p1'operty owner. It specifies that the income conditions 
established in Committee Amendment 11A11 apply after medical expenses have been 
deducted. In addition, it abthorizes the municipality to contract with a licensed 
auctioneer to conduct a real estate auction if the property doesn't sell within 6 months 
after listing. Finally, under the process established in Committee Amendment "A,11 a 
municipality must sell property for fair market value or the price at which an independent 
broker thinks the property would sell within 6 months; this amendment reduces that 
length of time from 6 months to 90 days.

This amendment removes the requirement for a separate notice to the taxpayer 
of potential eligibility to file for tax 
abatement. As the mandate for a separate notice is removed, the costs anticipated from increased abatement activity 
originating from the notification would not be considered mandated costs and the General Fund appropriation is 
reduced by $824,655 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The mandated requirements to engage a real estate broker, sell 
the property at fair market value or the price anticipated by the broker and remit excess proceeds to the taxpayer 
remain in the bill. As amended, the bill still contains an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $600 beginning in 
fiscal year 2018-19 to cover these costs. This amount represents 90% of the estimated net cost to municipalities not 
recovered through the sale of the property.
