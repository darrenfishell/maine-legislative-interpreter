32 Development has not taken a position  on the substance of the bill, and by reporting out 
33 this bill the committee  is not suggesting and does not intend  to suggest that it agrees or 
34 disagrees with any aspect of the recommendations included  in the report  from the Board  
35 of Dental Practice.  The committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of turning 
36 the Board  of Dental Practice's recommendations into a printed bill that can be referred to 
37 the committee for an appropriate  public  hearing  and subsequent processing  in the normal  
Page 12 - 128LR2838(01)-11 course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure  clarity and transparency in the 
2 legislative review of the board's recommendations for amending  the Dental  Practice  Act.
3 The bill makes the following changes to the Dental Practice Act.
4 1.  It eliminates the  charitable dentist and clinical  dentist educator license  categories.

6 practice under the supervision of the student's  instructors without first obtaining a license 
7 from the Board  of Dental Practice.
8 3.  It eliminates  the requirement  that dental or denturist student externs register with 
9 the Board of Dental Practice.
10 4.  It creates a new denturist trainee registration category for individuals who have

12 practice under the supervision  of a dentist or a denturist  prior to obtaining a denturist 
13 license.
14 5.  It authorizes independent practice  dental hygienists to supervise dental  
15 radiographers.
16 6.  It streamlines the scope of practice provisions for expanded function  dental

19 7.  It authorizes dental hygienists and faculty  dental hygienists to apply sealants  under  
20 the general supervision  of a dentist without requiring that a dentist first make  the
