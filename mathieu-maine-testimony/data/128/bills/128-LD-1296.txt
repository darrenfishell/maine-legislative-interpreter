 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  34-A MRSA §1201, as amended by PL 1991, c. 314, §9, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
§1201.  Legislative intent; findings  4 
Recognizing the need to firmly control all of the State's correction al and detention 5 
facilities, provide for the safety of staff and clients, undertake appropriate programming 6 
for the classification, education, rehabilitation and maintenance of clients and assure an 7 
effective system for the supervision of parolees and prob ationers, it is the intent of the 8 
Legislature to create a Department of Corrections to improve the administration of 9 
correctional facilities, programs and services for clients.  10 
The Legislature finds and declares that the management and operation of a 11 
corre ctional facility or institution or a forensic hospital that provides psychiatric services 12 
to the correctional system and the court system involve functions that are inherently 13 
governmental.  The imposition of punishment on errant citizens through incarcera tion 14 
requires the State, a unit of local government or a county sheriff to exercise their coercive 15 
police powers over individuals and is thus distinguishable from privatization in other 16 
areas of government.  It is further found that issues of liability, ac countability and cost 17 
warrant a prohibition of the ownership, operation or management of correctional facilities 18 
by private contractors.  19 
Sec. 2.  34-A MRSA §1201 -A is enacted to read:  20 
§1201 -A.  Certain contracts prohibited  21 
After the effective date of this section, the State, a unit of local government or a 22 
county sheriff is prohibited from contracting with a private contractor or private vendor 23 
for the provision of services relating to the operation of a correctional facility or a 24 
forensic hospital or the i ncarceration of persons in the custody of the department or a 25 
sheriff.  26 
SUMMARY  27 
This bill prohibits the privatization of state correctional facilities and forensic 28 
hospitals that provide psychiatric services to the correctional system and the Maine court 29 
system.  30
