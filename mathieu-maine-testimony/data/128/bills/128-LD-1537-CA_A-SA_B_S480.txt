This amendment provides that tax credits under the new Student Loan Repayment Credit for Maine Residents are 
refundable in certain years for loans used to acquire a degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics or an 
associate degree in any major. These provisions would reduce General Fund revenue by $27,550,000 and reduce 
Local Government Fund revenue by $1,450,000 in fiscal year 2019-20. These reductions are in addition to the 
reductions already expressed in the fiscal note for committee amendment "A".
