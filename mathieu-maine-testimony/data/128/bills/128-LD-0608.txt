 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  24-A MRSA ยง2452, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 385, ยง11, is amended to 2 
read:  3 
ยง2452.  Employee benefit excess insurance; nondiscrimination; prohibitions  4 
1.  Discrimination prohibited.   A pol icy of employee benefit excess insurance may 5 
not discriminate unfairly among or against beneficiaries of the underlying benefit plan, or 6 
treat conditions related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, more 7 
restrictively than other sicknesses or disab ling conditions.  8 
2.  Commutation clause.   A policy of employee benefit excess insurance may not 9 
contain a commutation clause that extinguishes the excess carrier's gross claims liability 10 
to the insured person through the recapture of loss reserves, unless the policy contains a 11 
provision giving the insured the option of requiring that the funds transferred in support 12 
of such a commutation have been evaluated by a qualified health actuary who is a 13 
member of the American Academy of Actuaries and has certified that the aggregate value 14 
of reserves to be recaptured are reasonably adequate to discharge the insured's expected 15 
liability for future costs of the health benefits covered by the excess policy.  16 
3.  Review.   An employee benefit excess insurance form is not exempt from the 17 
review provisions otherwise applicable under section 2412 on the ground that the form is 18 
designed for insurance on a particular subject.  19 
4.  Prohibition.   An insurer or a subsidiary of an insurer may not provide employee 20 
benefit excess insu rance to an employer that is eligible for a small group health plan, as 21 
defined in section 2808 -B. 22
