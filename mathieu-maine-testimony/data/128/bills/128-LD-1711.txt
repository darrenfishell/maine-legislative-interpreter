20 success; and
21 3.  A treatment team that meets project participants where they are physically  located

23 toward recovery,  employment  and self-sufficiency.   Support that uses enhanced risk 
24 evaluation and mitigation strategies and intensive case management and peer recovery  
25 services must be  provided  to project participants.
