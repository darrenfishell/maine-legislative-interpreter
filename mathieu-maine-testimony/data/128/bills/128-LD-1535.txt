the interests of the State would best be served;  8

the procurement of goods or services involves contract awards to any source that is 37 
willing and qualified to supply the goods or perform the services requested at a fair 38 
and reasonable cost.  A determination that the source is qualified and the cost is fair 39 
and reasonable  is at the discretion of the Chief Procurement Officer and subject to the 40

registry of suppliers must submit a request to the Director of the Bureau of General 7

identified by using a trade name and catalog number of a manufacturer or vendor, the 17 
term "or app roved equal," if not inserted with the identification, is implied.  There is a 18 
presumption that any reference to a particular manufacturer's product either by trade 19 
name or by limited description has been made solely for the purpose of more clearly 20 
indicat ing the minimum standard of quality desired.  Consideration must be given to 21 
proposals submitted on approved equal alternate commodities to the extent that such 22 
action serves the best interest of the State.  The bidder submitting a proposal on a 23

methodology for calculating bid price and cost differentials for services provided by 33 
businesses and state employees due to the provision of health and retirement benefits for 34

price and cost comparison among businesses when awarding contracts or grants a nd 36

"Maine is a state that believes employers should fairly compensate hard work, that 21 
the health and safety of working people should be protected  and that no form of 22 
unlawful discrimination or abuse should be tolerated.  Maine citizens are aware that 23 
laws and regulations designed to safeguard basic tenets of ethical business practice 24 
are disregarded in many workplaces, commonly referred to as "swea tshops."  State 25 
Government purchase of goods made under abusive conditions on behalf of its 26 
citizens offends Maine citizens' sense of justice and decency.  Moreover, when the 27 
State of Maine contracts with vendors whose suppliers profit by providing 28 
substan dard wages and working conditions, Maine's businesses are put at a 29 
competitive disadvantage.  Therefore, the State of Maine believes in doing business 30 
with vendors who make a good faith effort to ensure that they and their suppliers at 31 
the point of assembl y adhere to the principles of the State of Maine's purchasing code 32 
of conduct.  33 
"In its role as a market participant that procures goods covered by this code, the State 34 
of Maine seeks to protect the interests of Maine citizens and businesses by exercising 35 
its state sovereignty to spend Maine citizens' tax dollars in a manner consistent with 36 
their expressed wishes that the State deal with responsible bidders who seek contracts 37 
to supply goods to the State of Maine, and protect legally compliant Maine 38 
business es and workers from unfair competition created by downward pressure on 39 
prices and conditions attributable to businesses that violate applicable workplace 40 
laws.  41 
"Seeking to protect these local interests through the least discriminatory means 42 
available, the State of Maine requires that all bidders seeking contracts to supply the 43 
 
 Page 16 - 128LR0731(01) -1 
 State of Maine with goods covered by this code sign an affidavit stating that they and, 1 
to the best of their knowledge, their suppliers at the point of assembly comply with 2 
workplace laws of the vendor's or supplier's site of assembly and with treaty 3 
obligations that are shared by the United States and the country in which the goods 4 
are assembled."  5

covered by this subchapter, the State, through the State Purchasing Agen t Chief 20 
Procurement Officer , shall inform the contractor and engage in discussions with the 21 
contractor about the violation. The purpose of the discussions is to work in partnership 22 
with the contractor to influence the contractor to change its practices or to use its 23 
bargaining position with the offending supplier to change the supplier's practices, rather 24 
than to cease doing business with the contractor or supplier. The State Purchasing Agent  25 
Chief Procurement Officer  shall prescribe appropriate measures to  ensure compliance 26 
with the code of conduct. These measures may include, but are not limited to:  27 
A.  Requesting that each party found not to be in compliance with the code of 28 
conduct provide continued access to independent monitors, if available;  29 
B.  Reque sting that each party found not to be in compliance with the code of conduct 30 
offer their workers and managers the training and guidelines necessary to bring the 31 
workplace into compliance with the code of conduct; and  32 
C.  Requesting that each party found no t to be in compliance with the code of conduct 33 
demonstrate to the State Purchasing Agent  Chief Procurement Officer  that prescribed 34 
changes or improvements have been completed and implemented.  35 
2.  Termination of contract.   If, in the opinion of the State Pu rchasing Agent  Chief 36 
Procurement Officer , a contractor that has been determined as not in compliance with the 37 
code of conduct does not make good faith efforts to change its practices or use its 38 
bargaining position with an offending supplier to change the s upplier's practices, the State 39 
Purchasing Agent  Chief Procurement Officer  may take appropriate remedial action 40 
including, but not limited to, barring the subject contractor from bidding on future state 41 
 
 Page 19 - 128LR0731(01) -1

authority given in this subsection must be specifically referenced in the State's contracts 2 
with those contractors that are subject to the code of conduct.  3

be purchased by State Government;  9 
B.  Identify and develop a list of all work centers in the State, including a description 10 
of the products and services work centers are currently providing or have recently 11 
provided and including an as sessment of the products and services that work centers 12 
are capable of providing, but have not recently provided; and  13 
C.  Develop from the information obtained in paragraphs A and B a work center 14 
purchases schedule that describes all products and services to be purchased by the 15 
State that, in the view of the director  Chief Procurement Officer , could be provided 16 
by work centers. In developing this schedule, the director  Chief Procurement Officer  17 
shall give consideration to the abilities of work centers to me et contract requirements 18 
and to meet generally accepted quality control standards and any potential technical 19 
assistance that may be required to enable a work center to compete fairly for 20 
contracts, pursuant to this subchapter.  21 
5.  Competitive bidding.   The director  Chief Procurement Officer  shall develop 22 
procedures for competitive bidding by eligible work centers only for products and 23 
services identified on the work center purchase schedule. If no bid is received from a 24 
work center for any product or servi ce on the schedule, the director shall confer with the 25 
Department of Corrections to determine whether the Department of Corrections is able to 26 
provide the product or service at a fair price.  If the director and the Department of 27 
Corrections do not come to  agreement, the product or service must be put out to general 28 
bid by the director, in accordance with standard rules and procedures. If only one work 29 
center bid is received, the director shall review the bid and make a determination 30 
regarding the fairness of the price and terms of the proposed contract. If the director 31 
determines that the work center may not be awarded this bid, the director shall confer 32 
with the Department of Corrections to determine whether the Department of Corrections 33 
is able to provide  the product or service at a fair price.  If the director and the Department 34 
of Corrections do not come to agreement, the contract must be offered for standard 35 
competitive bid by the director in accordance with standard rules and procedures  Work 36 
centers mu st compete for the State's bid opportunities in conjunction with all other 37 
bidders providing a given service or product . 38 
6.  Award of contracts; fair price.   The director  Chief Procurement Officer  has final 39 
determination in awarding contracts to work cente rs through the competitive bidding 40 
process. The director's  Chief Procurement Officer's  judgment prevails in the 41 
determination that the price and contract terms are fair and reasonable both to the work 42 
center and to the State. In determining a fair price, t he director  Chief Procurement Officer  43 
 
 Page 20 - 128LR0731(01) -1 
 shall ensure the ability of the work center to recover the costs of labor, material, 1 
equipment, overhead and delivery.  In determining the award of a contract to a work 2 
center, the Chief Procurement Officer shall give work centers a 10% cost preference 3 
when bidding against bidders that are not work centers.  4 
7.  Assignment of contracts.   The director  Chief Procurement Officer  shall ensure 5 
that contracts awarded to work centers may not be assigned to any other vendor, exc ept as 6 
may be necessary to complete the contracts, because of extraordinary events beyond the 7 
control of the work centers. Any additional costs incurred because of these assignments 8 
must be borne by the work center as a normal cost of doing business.  9

to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 10 
development.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 11

2.  Selection of standard -offer service providers.   After terms and conditions for 37 
standard -offer service have been established under subsec tion 1, the commission shall 38

and distribution utility's service territory.  By December 1, 1999, the commission shall 40 
review the bid submissions for each transmissio n and distribution utility and select the 41 
standard -offer service provider or providers for that utility's service territory.  42 
 
 Page 24 - 128LR0731(01) -1 
 A.  The commission shall determine the general credit data and specific information 1 
from general load and usage data that transmiss ion and distribution utilities must 2 
provide to potential standard -offer service bidders, including, but not limited to, 3 
monthly demand and energy consumption and the number of customers in each 4 
customer class.  The commission shall ensure that individual c ustomer confidentiality 5 
is preserved in this process and that a transmission and distribution utility releases 6 
customer -specific data only with the customer's permission.  If the transmission and 7 
distribution utility incurs additional costs to develop and produce the required data, 8 
the commission shall permit that utility to recover those costs through transmission 9 
and distribution rates.  10 
B.  The commission shall establish the maximum duration of a standard -offer service 11 
contract after considering all relev ant factors, including, but not limited to, market 12 
risks and the need for price stability and contract flexibility.  13 
C.  A competitive electricity provider that is an affiliate of a large investor -owned 14 
transmission and distribution utility may submit bids to provide standard -offer 15 
service for up to 20% of the electric load within the service territory of the large 16 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility with which it is affiliated.  To 17 
prevent the unfair use of information possessed by a large investor -owned 18 
transmission and distribution utility, the commission shall ensure that a utility 19 
seeking to bid on standard -offer service has no greater access to relevant information 20 
than is provided to other potential bidders.  21 
D.  A consumer -owned transm ission and distribution utility and a small investor - 22 
owned transmission and distribution utility may submit bids to provide standard -offer 23 
service for that utility's service territory.  To prevent the unfair use of information 24 
possessed by a consumer -owned  transmission and distribution utility or a small 25 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility, the commission shall ensure that 26 
a utility seeking to bid on standard -offer service has no greater access to relevant 27 
information than is provided to ot her potential bidders.  28 
The commission shall adopt rules establishing a methodology for structuring the bidding 29 
process for standard -offer service in order to implement the provisions of this subsection.  30 
In adopting rules, the commission shall consider met hods to ensure, to the extent 31 
possible, at least 3 providers of standard -offer service in each transmission and 32 
distribution utility service territory, as long as the method does not result in any 33 
significant adverse impacts on rates paid by consumers.  Ru les adopted under this 34 
subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter II-A 35 
2-A. 36 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the commission may, in the event of a 37 
default by a standard -offer service provider, requ ire the transmission and distribution 38 
utility in whose service territory the provider was providing standard -offer service to 39 
arrange and to provide for default service.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this 40 
Title, the commission may, in the event t hat the commission receives no bids to provide 41 
standard -offer service in a transmission and distribution utility's territory or the 42 
commission determines that the bids it receives are inadequate or unacceptable, require 43 
the transmission and distribution ut ility to arrange and to provide for default service.  44 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the commission may require a 45 
 
 Page 25 - 128LR0731(01) -1 
 transmission and distribution utility to provide default service to its customers that are not 1 
located within either the N ew England independent system operator control area or the 2 
Maritimes control area; and default service pursuant to this sentence must be provided to 3 
customers at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as standard -offer 4 
service is provided to t he customers of the transmission and distribution utility in the 5 
standard -offer class in which the customer is eligible to receive service.  The arrangement 6 
and provision of such default service by a transmission and distribution utility does not 7 
constitut e selling electric energy or capacity at retail for purposes of section 3205, 8 
subsection 2.  9 
Notwithstanding Title 5, section 1831, the commission is not subject to rules adopted by 10 
the State Purchasing Agent  Chief Procurement Officer  in conducting the comp etitive 11
