3 1-A.  Referendum  on forming joint charter commission.  If a petition  is filed

12 Sec. 2.  30-A MRSA §2152, sub-§2, as enacted  by PL 1987, c. 737, Pt. A, §2 and 
13 Pt. C, §106 and amended  by PL 1989, c. 6; c. 9, §2; and c. 104, Pt. C, §§8 and 10, is

21 members, it may  not participate  in the consolidation.
22 Sec. 3.  30-A MRSA §2155,  as enacted by PL 1987, c. 737, Pt. A, §2 and Pt. C,

25 §2155.  Limitation
26 If the voters of a municipality reject  a consolidation  agreement, that municipality  may 
27 not be a party  to any consolidation agreement  for 3 10 years after the date of the rejection, 
28 except when 30% of the qualified voters have requested  an agreement by signing a 
29 petition under section  2152, subsection 1 or when a majority of the municipal officers in 
30 each municipality  proposed  for consolidation in the rejected consolidation agreement  vote 
31 to form a joint charter commission to draft a consolidation  agreement .
32 SUMMARY
33 This bill provides that if a municipality receives a petition proposing to form  a joint 
34 charter commission  for the purpose of consolidating with one or more  municipalities,  the 
35 municipal officers must hold a referendum to determine the willingness of the voters  of 
36 the municipality  to form a joint charter  commission.  If the referendum question is 
37 approved by a majority of voters in each municipality, a joint charter  commission must be 
38 formed.  It also provides that a municipality may not be a party  to a consolidation  
39 agreement for 10 years, instead of 3 years  as in current law, after the date a consolidation  
Page 2 - 128LR2831(01)-11 agreement is rejected.  It also adds an exception to that 10-year period for when a 
2 majority of the municipal officers  in each municipality subject  to the rejected 
3 consolidation agreement vote to form a  joint  charter commission.
