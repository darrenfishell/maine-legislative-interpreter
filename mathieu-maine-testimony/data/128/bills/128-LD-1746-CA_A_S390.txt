This bill would reduce General Fund revenue by an estimated $299, 8 80 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue 
by $6,120 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
Any additional costs to the Public Utilities Commission as a result of clarifications to the rules regarding their 
adjustment of the prepaid wireless telecommunications service fee and specifications that federal universal support 
funds paid directly to sellers are not subject to sales taxes are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
