Amend the bill in section 1 in ยง3028-A by striking out all of the last 2 paragraphs 
(page 1, lines 10 to 18 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'The Chief Medical Examiner may assume responsibility for the disposal of identified 
human remains of a deceased resident of this State that are the subject of a medical 
examiner case if no one takes custody and control of the human remains for a period of 
30 days after the Chief Medical Examiner has both completed an autopsy or necessary 
examination of the human remains and made reasonable inquiry under section 3028-D, 
subsection 1. Such abandoned remains may be interred or cremated. The Chief Medical 
Examiner shall :file or cause to be :filed a certificate of abandonment in the municipality 
where the human remains were recovered that indicates the means of disposal. 
In the absence of a responsible party, payment of expenses incurred by the Chief 
Medical Examiner pursuant to this section must be made pursuant to section 3028-D, 
subsection 2 as if the remains were unidentified. The Chief Medical Examiner may seek 
to recover costs from the estate or municipality of residence of the deceased.' 
SUMMARY 
The Department of the Attorney General, Office of Chief Medical Examiner 
currently has authority to make appropriate disposition of unidentified human remains 
and identified human remains without a connection to the State. This amendment

with a connection to the State and that the State is the payor of last resort.
