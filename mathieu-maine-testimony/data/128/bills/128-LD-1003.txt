 Whereas, on October 25, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 1 
California approved the Volkswagen Partial Consent Decree between plaintiffs United 2 
States Environmental Protection Agency and the State of California and defendants 3 
Volkswa gen AG, Audi AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., and Volkswagen Group 4 
of America Chattanooga Operations, LLC, referred to in this preamble as "Volkswagen," 5 
to settle a complaint alleging violations of the federal Clean Air Act related to the 6 
operation o f certain noncompliant Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles; and  7 
Whereas, Volkswagen admitted that software in certain Volkswagen diesel vehicles 8 
enables the vehicles' emission control module to operate emission control systems when 9 
undergoing emission test ing but to render the emission control systems inoperative when 10 
not undergoing emission testing, resulting in emissions that exceed federal levels for 11 
nitrogen oxides when the vehicles are driven on the road; and  12 
Whereas, to fully mitigate the total lifeti me excess nitrogen oxide emissions from 13 
certain noncompliant Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles, Volkswagen agreed to pay 14 
funds into the Volkswagen environmental mitigation trust to fund eligible mitigation 15 
actions within the United States and its territo ries; and  16 
Whereas, there are many noncompliant Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles 17 
registered in the State; and  18 
Whereas, in accordance with the terms of the Volkswagen Partial Consent Decree, 19 
the State may seek a portion of the Volkswagen environmental mit igation trust to fund 20 
specific eligible mitigation actions to mitigate the lifetime excess nitrogen oxide 21 
emissions in the State from the noncompliant Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles; and  22 
Whereas, it is the intention of the State to elect to become con firmed as a 23 
Volkswagen environmental mitigation trust fund beneficiary by timely filing of the 24 
necessary certifications; and  25 
Whereas, upon the trustee of the environmental mitigation trust confirming the 26 
State as a beneficiary under the Volkswagen Partial Consent Decree, the State will 27 
prepare and submit to the trustee the required beneficiary mitigation plan, which will 28 
describe the measures that the State intends to fund with the Volkswagen environmental 29 
mitigation trust proceeds, and will request funds f rom the trustee for specific eligible 30 
mitigation actions; now, therefore, be it  31 
Sec. 1.  Inclusion in the beneficiary mitigation plan.  Resolved:  That, in 32 
order to benefit the public at large, improve the air quality of the State and maximize the 33 
economic  benefits to the State the beneficiary mitigation plan developed by the State to 34 
mitigate the lifetime nitrogen oxide emissions from noncompliant Volkswagen and Audi 35 
diesel vehicles must, to the extent possible, include the use of Maine -generated nonfossil  36 
fuel sources.  37
