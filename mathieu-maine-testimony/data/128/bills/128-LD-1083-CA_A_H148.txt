128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 761, L.D. 1083, Bill, "An Act To 
Increase the Penalties for Hunting Deer over Bait" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 12 MRSA ยง10902, sub-ยง7-B is enacted to read: 
7-B. Hunting deer over bait. A hunting license of a person convicted of placing or 
hunting over bait in violation of section 11452, subsection 1 must be revoked, and that 
person is ineligible to obtain a hunting license as follows: 
A. For a first offense, for a period of one year from the date of conviction; and 
B. For a 2nd offense, for a period of 2 years from the date of conviction.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment provides, like the bill, that the hunting license of a person who is 
convicted of hunting over bait during an open season on deer must be revoked for one 
year. The amendment adds a provision for a 2-year revocation for a 2nd offense. The 
amendment removes the provision of the bill that imposes a mandatory fine of $500.
