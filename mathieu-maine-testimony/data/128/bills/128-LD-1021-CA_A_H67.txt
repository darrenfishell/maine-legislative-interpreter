Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $3,250 in fiscal year 2017-18. The Legislature's 
proposed budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 for legislative studies. Whether this amount is sufficient to 
fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. The 
additional costs of providing staffing assistance to the study during the interim can be absorbed utilizing existing 
budgeted staff resources.
