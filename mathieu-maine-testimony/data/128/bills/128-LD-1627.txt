SUMMARY  29 
This bill requires that a voter provide proof of identity with photographic 30 
identification for the purpose of voting .  The bill specifies the types of photographic 31 
identification that may be used to verify the identity of a voter.  It provides that a person 32 
who does not present photographic identification may cast a provisional ballot and 33 
establishes the process for pro visional voting.  Under this process, if the person can verify 34 
the person's identity to the warden or an election clerk within 3 business days of the 35 
election by presenting acceptable photographic identification, the ballot will be cast as a 36 
regular ballot . Through the general election of 2018, a person who does not present 37 
acceptable photographic identification but is known to a municipal clerk, registrar or 38 
election official at the voting place may cast a regular ballot upon submission of an 39 
affidavit by the municipal clerk, registrar or election official attesting to the person's 40 
identity.  Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to provide, at no fee, nondriver 41
