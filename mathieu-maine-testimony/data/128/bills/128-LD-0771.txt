PROTECTED SPEECH  4 
ยง4751.  Legislative findings  5 
The Legislature finds that the courts have accorded political speech the highest level 6 
of protection from abridgment.  7 
The Legislature, in agreement with the United States Supreme Court, finds no basis 8 
for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the government may impose 9 
restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.  10 
The Legisla ture finds that statutory prohibitions on state action concerning political 11 
speech are necessary in order to ensure the highest level of protection for political speech.  12

speech 14 
1.  Investigations and prosecutions.   Notwithstanding authority provided in Title 5, 15

2.  Use of prosecutorial power.   Notwithstanding authority provided in Title 5, 19 
chapter 9, the Attorney General may not use prosecutorial power to favor or disfavor 20

SUMMARY  31 
This bill reinforces the recognition that political speech is deserving of the greates t 32 
protection from abridgment by the government.  The United States Supreme Court in 33 
Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 558 U.S. 310 (2010), continued the 34 
protection of protected political speech, no matter the source or message.  This bill 35 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0297(01) -1

decision and to clearly state the need for statutory protections of protected political 2 
speech.  3 
The bill specifically prohibits the Attorney General from investigating, joinin g an 4 
investigation initiated by another state or the Federal Government or prosecuting any 5 
person based on that person's protected political speech.  It also prohibits the Attorney 6 
General from using the Attorney General's prosecutorial power to favor or d isfavor 7 
protected political speech.  8 
The bill also prohibits the State from favoring or disfavoring any person based on the 9 
person's climate change policy preferences with regard to grants, contracts or 10 
employment.  11
