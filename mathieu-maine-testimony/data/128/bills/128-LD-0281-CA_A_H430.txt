128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,f+,, to H.P. 214, L.D. 281, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Percentage of Votes Needed for Condominium Governance" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 33 MRSA ยง1602-117, sub-ยง(d), as enacted by PL 1981, c. 699, is 
amended to read: 
( d) Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this 
Act, oo an amendment may not create or increase special declarant rights, increase the 
number of units, or change the boundaries of any unit, the allocated interests of a unit, or 
the uses to which any unit is restricted, in the absence of unanimous oonsent of the unit 
the vote or agreement of the owner of each unit particularly affected and the owners of 
the units to which 90% of the votes of the association are allocated other than the 
declarant or such larger percentage as the declaration provides.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill but addresses the same issue as the bill, which is to 
allow a vote that is less than unanimous to make changes to a condominium declaration. 
The amendment, modeled on a law in Washington, requires the approval of all of the 
owners of the units particularly affected, as well as the approval of 90% of the owners of 
the total number of units, rather than 100%.
