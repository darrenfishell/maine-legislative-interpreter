Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill repeals the individual income tax addition modification for state contributions to the retirement system on 
behalf of the taxpayer and makes changes to the subtraction modification for pick-up contributions distributed to the 
taxpayer in the form of a rollover. It would result in a loss of General Fund revenue of $3 ,329,000 in fiscal year 2017-
18 and $11,3 72,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a loss of Local Government Fund revenue of $68,000 in fiscal year 
2017-18 and $232,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. It would also reduce revenue to the Fund to Advance Public 
Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education by $65,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $133,000 in fiscal year 2018-19.
