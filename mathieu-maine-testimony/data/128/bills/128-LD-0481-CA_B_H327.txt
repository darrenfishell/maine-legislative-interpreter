SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services. The amendment specifies that beginning July 1, 2019, in 
determining benefit levels for T ANF recipients who have earnings from employment, the 
Depaitment of Health and Human Services must disregard from monthly earnings the 
following: for a recipient employed 40 or more hours per week and who meets work 
patticipation requirements as defined in federal TANF rules, 100% of the gross earned 
income for the first full month of employment and the next consecutive month of 
employment, 75% of the gross earned income for the next 6 consecutive months of 
employment and 50% of the gross earned income for each additional consecutive month 
of employment thereafter and for a recipient employed less than 40 hours per week and 
who meets work participation requirements as defined in federal T ANF rules, 100% of 
the gross earned income for the first full month of employment, 75% of the gross earned 
income for the next 6 consecutive months of employment and 50% of the gross earned 
income for each additional consecutive month of employment thereafter. 
The amendment strikes from the bill the department's prohibition on considering the 
following in determining benefit levels for TANF recipients: $108 and 50% of the 
remaining earnings that are less than the federal poverty level. 
The amendment also specifies that the department may disregard 100% of earnings 
for a recipient only one time in a 12-month period. 
The amendment restores the provision in current law removed by the bill directing 
the department to disregard from monthly earnings all actual child care costs necessary 
for work, except that the department may limit the child care disregard to $175 per month 
per child or $200 per month per child under 2 years of age or with special needs. 
The amendment also removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause.

Future biem1ium cost increase -Federal Block Grant Fund 
This bill increases the amount of income earned by recipients of benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families program that is disregarded in determining the amount of benefits they receive, beginning on July 1, 2019. 
The amount of the disregard is lowered over time as recipients make the transition to stable employment. Sufficient 
data is not cmrently available to detennine what the additional cost would be, but any cost would accrue to the 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Federal Block Grant Fund and would have no impact on the General Fund 
spending.
