128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "H" to H.P. 630, L.D. 902, "Resolve, To Increas~ 
Access to Evidence-based Psychosocial Treatment for Children in the MaineCare 
Program" 
Amend the resolve by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Develop MaineCare Reimbursement Rates for Trauma-focused 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' 
Amend the resolve by striking out everything after the title and before the summary 
and inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy is currently available under 
the MaineCare program but needs its own reimbursement code to ensure that costs to 
providers are met; and 
Whereas, to prevent the loss of providers of services, rates must be developed as 
soon as possible; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a rate 
study to develop a new rate for MaineCare reimbursement for trauma­
focused cognitive behavioral therapy. Resolved: That the Department of Health 
and Human Services shall contract for a 3rd-party independent rate study to develop a 
separate reimbursement rate for trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to be 
available to be billed under rule Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Section 65. In 
establishing the rate, the rate study must take into consideration the following:
