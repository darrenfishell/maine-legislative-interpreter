17 This amendment adds language to the bill to change the calculation of the number of 
18 signatures required for a petition for municipal consolidation to be based on the number 
19 of votes cast at the last gubernatorial election, rather than the number of voters in the 
20 municipality. It also adds language to allow a municipal charter to override the limit of 
21 1,000 signatures that is set for certain municipalities. It also provides a cross-reference to 
22 the exception to the required number of signatures that applies in the period after a 
23 consolidation agreement is rejected by the voters. 
24 The amendment specifies that the referendum on the formation of a joint charter 
25 commission must be at least 90 days after the petition is filed to allow for election 
26 preparation and deadlines. It also adds language to the referendum question to inform the 
27 voters that the consolidation agreement prepared by the commission would not be final 
28 unless approved by the voters. 
29 The amendment adds language in the section regarding conditions for holding 
30 elections for a joint charter commission to cross-reference the vote by municipal officers 
31 to hold such elections. 
32 The amendment sets the waiting period after a rejected consolidation agreement to 6 
33 years, rather than 10 years as provided in the bill. It clarifies that the number of signatures 
34 required for a petition to obtain an exception to the waiting period is 30% of votes cast in 
35 the last gubernatorial election, rather than 30% of voters. It also clarifies the exception to 
36 the waiting period permitted by a vote of municipal officers, as provided in the bill, to 
37 specify that the vote is to hold elections of members to a joint charter commission.
