SUMMARY 
This amendment makes the following changes to the bill: 
1. It clarifies the process for the appointment and confirmation of the Maine 
Broadband Initiative director by requiring that the Governor appoint a person who has 
experience in the management of organizations that maximize partnerships and 
collaborations. The amendment also provides that the appointee is subject to review by 
the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over public utilities 
and technology matters rather than telecommunications and broadband matters and must 
be confirmed by the Legislature rather than the Board of Directors of the Maine 
Broadband Initiative; 
2. It changes the definition of "unserved area" to mean an area within the State that 
has an actual broadband speed that is slower than 10 megabits per second, rather than 25 
megabits as in the bill; 
3. It removes a policy and goal of the Maine Broadband Initiative from the bill; 
4. It changes the criteria that the Governor must consider when making an 
appointment to the Board of Directors of the Maine Broadband Initiative; 
5. It removes the provision in the bill that allows appointment of directors of the 
Board of Directors of the Maine Broadband Initiative by the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the President of the Senate; 
6. It further changes the composition of the membership of the Board of Directors of 
the Maine Broadband Initiative; 
7. It limits administrative costs of the Maine Broadband Initiative to no more than 
10% of the annual funds received from the Maine Broadband Initiative Fund; 
8. It changes the date from July 1st to September 1st as it relates to the crediting of 
the tax assessment by the State Tax Assessor to the Maine Broadband Initiative Fund; and 
9. The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.

This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $66,040 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $136,094 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to a newly established Office of Broadband Development within the Department of Economic and 
Community Development for one Public Service Executive II position to serve as President of the Maine Broadband 
Initiative beginning January 1, 2018. 
The bill replaces the ConnectME Authority with the Maine Broadband Initiative. Revenue generated from the 
telecommunications excise tax will now be credited to the Maine Broadband Initiative Fund instead of the General 
Fund. This is estimated to reduce General Fund revenue by $6,250,000 annually beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The 
Maine Broadband Initiative is authorized to issue bonds for the purpose of construction of advanced communications 
technology infrastructure and for the fulfillment of other undertakings it may assume. These bonds do not constitute a 
debt of the State or of any agency or political subdivision of the State but are payable solely from the revenue of the 
initiative, and neither the faith nor the credit nor taxing power of the State or any political subdivision of the State is 
pledged to payment of the bonds. 
Additonal costs to the University of Maine System and the Department of Economic and Community Development to 
serve on the Board of Directors of the Maine Broadband Initiative can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
