17 technical education regions is based upon a model  that recognizes program components  
18 that have  been  approved by the department  pursuant to chapter 313 for:
19 A.  Direct instruction.   The direct instruction  component includes personnel costs for 
20 teachers, education technicians for programs and clinical  supervisors for health  care 
21 programs.  The allocation for direct  instruction is the sum of the costs as determined 
22 based on the following components, which  the commissioner shall  determine  
23 annually:
24 (1)  A teacher salary matrix.  In determining the teacher salary  matrix for each 
25 program, the commissioner shall give consideration to the most recent available 
26 data regarding years of education experience and years of professional  work 
27 experience relevant to instructional  assignment;
28 (2)  Student- to-teacher ratios for  each program;
29 (3)  The number  of education technicians required for purposes of instructional 
30 support, based on student enrollment and program requirements.  The 
31 commissioner shall  calculate  the education technician allocation by multiplying 
32 the number of education  technicians required by the statewide average  salary for 
33 full-time education  technicians, based on the most recent available salary data, 
34 but shall ensure that each career and technical education center or career  and 
35 technical education region  is allocated at least one full-time education technician; 
36 and
37 (4)  The clinical supervision  staffing  level necessary for each program  requiring  
38 such staffing,  based on student enrollment  as determined pursuant  to paragraph  
39 G;
Page 3 - 128LR2731(01)-11 B.  Central administration.  The central administration component includes personnel 
2 costs for directors, assistant directors  and clerical  staff working  in career and 
3 technical education  centers  and career  and technical education regions, as well as 
4 business managers  working  in career and technical education regions.   The central 
5 administration allocation is the sum of:
6 (1)  Costs for personnel for each career and technical education center and career 
7 and technical education  region, as  follows:
8 (a)  A director,  the allocation for which must be  for one full-time equivalent;
9 (b)  An assistant director,  the allocation for which must  be based  on student  
10 enrollment as  determined pursuant to paragraph  G;
11 (c)  Clerical staff, the allocation for which must be for at least one full-time 
12 equivalent, with additional  clerical  staff allocations based  on student  
13 enrollment as  determined pursuant to paragraph  G;
14 (d)  A career and technical education region business  manager, the allocation  
15 for which must be for  one full-time equivalent; and
16 (e)  Benefit  costs for employees in central administration,  which must be 
17 calculated pursuant  to section 15678, subsection 5, paragraph B; and
18 (2)  Nonpersonnel  costs, which the commissioner shall calculate annually based 
19 upon the relationship of the most recent  available career and technical education 
20 expenditures for nonpersonnel costs to personnel costs;
21 C.  Supplies and other expenditures such as purchased services, dues and fees for 
22 instructional programs.   The allocation  for supplies and other expenditures is the sum 
23 of:
24 (1)  A per-program allocation for supplies, as determined by the commissioner  
25 based on the most recent available career and technical  education expenditures 
26 amount, adjusted to the year  prior to the allocation year;  and
27 (2)  A per-pupil allocation for each student  in each career and technical education 
28 center and each career  and technical education region, determined  by the 
29 commissioner by dividing the amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (1) 
30 by student enrollment, as  determined pursuant to paragraph G;
31 D.  Plant  operation and maintenance, including all costs for operating and 
32 maintaining buildings and grounds.  The commissioner shall determine the allocation 
33 for plant operation and maintenance costs for each career and technical education 
34 center and each career and technical education region  by multiplying the square 
35 footage of the career and technical education center or career and technical education 
36 region building by an  amount per square foot,  as determined by the  commissioner;
37 E.  Other student and staff support, which includes costs for student services 
38 coordination, career preparation, instructional technology, professional development, 
39 student assessment and program safety.  The other student and staff support 
40 allocation is the sum of the  costs  for:
Page 4 - 128LR2731(01)-11 (1)  A counselor, the allocation for which must be for one full-time equivalent, to 
2 collaborate with sending  school guidance counselors in order to maximize 
3 student participation at the  middle school and high school  grade  levels;
4 (2)  A career and technical education center or career  and technical education 
5 region student services coordinator, the allocation for which must be based  on 
6 student enrollment, as determined pursuant  to paragraph  G, but no less than one 
7 full-time equivalent;
8 (3)  Benefit costs for employees under this paragraph, calculated pursuant to 
9 section 15678,  subsection  5, paragraph B; and
10 (4)  Instructional technology, staff professional development, student assessment 
11 and program  safety.  The commissioner shall calculate a per-pupil allocation for 
12 this allocation based upon student  enrollment,  as determined pursuant  to 
13 paragraph G, and the relationship  of the most  recent available career  and 
14 technical education expenditures for these costs to total costs, adjusted  to the year 
15 prior to the allocation year;
16 F.  Equipment provided  pursuant to subsection 6; and
17 G.  Student enrollment, which is determined as follows.
18 (1)  For established programs or plans, student enrollment is a 3-year average  of 
19 the attending student  counts  on October 1st for  each program  or plan.
20 (2)  For new programs or plans,  student enrollment must be based  on the 
21 estimated attending student count submitted in accordance with the application 
22 for the program or plan approval.  This estimated  student count must  be used 
23 until the program or plan has 3 consecutive years of actual attending  student  
24 counts on October 1st.
25 The total allocation  for a career and technical education  center or career and technical 
26 education region must be calculated by comparing the sum of the components  in 
27 paragraphs A to E to the most recent expenditure data, as adjusted to the year prior to the 
28 allocation year.  A career and technical education center or career and technical education 
29 region may not receive  less than the adjusted expenditures or more than the adjusted 
30 expenditures plus 5%.
31 The commissioner shall  authorize monthly payment of allocations to career  and technical 
32 education centers and career and technical education regions in an amount equal  to 1/12 
33 of the allocation.   Payments for satellite programs as approved pursuant  to chapter  313 
34 must be made  within this schedule  to the responsible career and technical education 
35 center or career  and technical education region; it is the responsibility of the career  and 
36 technical education center or career  and technical  education region  to provide the state 
37 support for the approved satellite program to the school  administrative unit that operates 
38 the approved satellite  program.
39 If a school  administrative unit operating a career and technical education center or career 
40 and technical  education region has any unexpended funds  at the end of the fiscal  year, 
41 these funds  must be carried forward for the purposes of  career  and technical education.
42 Sec. 8.  20-A MRSA §15688-A, sub-§8 is  enacted to read:
Page 5 - 128LR2731(01)-11 8.  Pilot projects for middle school  career  and technical education.  Beginning in 
2 fiscal year 2018- 19 and for the 2 subsequent fiscal  years, the commissioner may expend  
3 and disburse funds to career and technical education centers and career and technical 
4 education regions for pilot projects  for middle  school level  plans approved pursuant to 
5 chapter 313 to create career  and technical education for middle  school level  students.  
6 The commissioner also may contract for services  to implement pilot projects  for middle  
7 school level plans.  A middle school level plan must  demonstrate  to the commissioner a 
8 partnership between a school  administrative  unit and a career  and technical education 
9 center or career  and technical education region.
10 SUMMARY
11 This bill amends  the current calculation of state subsidy for career  and technical 
12 education from  an expenditure-driven model to a cost model to recognize current costs of 
13 direct instruction, operation of facilities and student and administrative support.  The bill 
14 also changes the subsidy payment for satellite  programs  and career  and technical  
15 education regions  and establishes funding  provisions  for the operation of career and 
16 technical education middle school programs through authorization of pilot programs.
