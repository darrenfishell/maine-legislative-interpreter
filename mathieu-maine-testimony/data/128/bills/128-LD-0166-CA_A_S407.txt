20 SUMMARY 
21 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, requires that any 
22 additional federal funding received in a child care and development block grant due to the 
23 passage of the federal Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, PL 115-123, and any subsequent 
24 funding legislation, must be applied to increasing reimbursement rates to child care 
25 centers up to the 75th percentile of local market rates for child care services. Payment 
26 rates for children with special needs may be higher. Family child care providers are 
27 already being reimbursed at the 75th percentile. This amendment increases rates to child 
28 care centers, according to the amount of increased discretionary funding received, up to 
29 the 75th percentile.

An Act To Increase Reimbursement for Child Care Services 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment ''A'' cs;-YDl) 
Committee: Health and Human Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Contingent current biennium cost increase -Federal Block Grant Fund 
This bill allows the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to increase rates paid to child care centers up 
to the 75th percentile in the child care subsidy program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program 
(TANF) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -Additional Support for People in Retraining and 
Employment Program (ASPIRE) contingent upon the Child Care and Development Block Grant discretionary funding 
being increased by federal legislation. The federal Bipartisan Budget Act, PL 115-123 increased federal discretionaiy 
spending to multiple programs. However, the actual programs that will receive the discretionaiy increases are not 
known at this time. When that information becomes known, the additional allocations to allow the rate increases will 
need to be made by financial order. 
Assuming that the discretionaiy funding allows for the increase in the rates to the 75th percentile, DHHS would 
require Federal Block Grant allocations of $6,510,610 annually. Of this funding, $4,058,620 would be on behalf of 
recipients of benefits under the child care subsidy program and $2,451,990 would be on behalf of recipients of 
benefits under the TANF and ASPIRE programs.
