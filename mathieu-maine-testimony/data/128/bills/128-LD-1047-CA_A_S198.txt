9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/Jr;' to S.P. 350, L.D. 1047, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Protect Homeowners from Improper Foreclosure Fees" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
12 'Sec. 1. 14 MRSA ยง6101, as amended by PL 2011, c. 269, ยง1, is further amended 
13 to read: 
14 ยง6101. Attorney's fees 
15 For the foreclosure of a mortgage by any method authorized by this chapter, if the 
16 mortgagee prevails, the mortgagee or the person claiming under the mortgagee may 
17 charge a reasonable attorney's fee which is a lien on the mortgaged estate, and must be 
18 included with the expense of publication, service and recording in making up the sum to 
19 be tendered by the mortgagor or the person claiming under the mortgagor in order to be 
20 entitled to redeem, provided the sum has actually been paid in full or partial discharge of 
21 an attorney's fee. If the mortgagee plaintiff in the foreclosure action does not prevail, or 
22 upon evidence that the action was not brought in good faith, the court may order the 
23 mortgagee plaintiff to pay the mortgagor's reasonable court costs and attorney's fees 
24 incurred in defending against the foreclosure or any proceeding within the foreclosure 
25 action and deny in full or in part the award of attorney's fees and costs to the mortgagee. 
26 For purposes of this section, "does not prevail" does not mean a stipulation of dismissal 
27 entered into by the parties, an agreed-upon motion to dismiss without prejudice to 
28 facilitate settlement or successful mediation of the foreclosure action pursuant to section 
29 6321-A.' 
30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
3 2 It simplifies the language of the bill to make it clear that if the plaintiff in the foreclosure 
33 action does not prevail or did not bring the action in good faith, the court can order the 
34 plaintiff to pay costs and attorney's fees.
