An individual may not receive more than 6 weeks of benefits in a benefit year pursuant to 
this subsection unless approved by the Department of Labor. 
Sec. 5. 26 MRSA §1192, last 1, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 645, §5, is amended to 
read: 
For purposes of subsections 2, 3, 12 and 13, "good cause" means the unemployed

eligibility assessment with the Department of Labor within the prior 5 years, that 
individual is considered to have good cause for not participating in reemployment 
services and eligibility assessment under subsections 12 and 13. "Good cause" does not 
include incarceration as a result of a conviction for a felony or misdemeanor.

SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. It creates an exemption from the 
eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits dealing with work search for an 
individual otherwise eligible for unemployment benefits when that individual has been 
temporarily laid off with a definite recall date for a period of 6 weeks during that 
temporary layoff, as long as the individual remains in contact with and is able and

available to work for that employer. Use of this exemption beyond 6 weeks total in a

Fiscal Detail and Notes $71,200 $0 $0 
This bill includes a one-time Federal Expenditures Fund allocation of$71,200 in fiscal year 2017-18 to the 
Employment Security Services program within the Department of Labor for the cost of making computer 
programming updates to implement changes to eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits. 
Creating exemptions from eligibility requirements individuals must meet to qualify for unemployment benefits will 
increase costs to the Unemployment Trust Fund within the Department of Labor beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. $0 
The department estimates the cost to be between $3.8 million and $43.2 million per year in benefits being paid to 
individuals not actively searching for work and potentially not returning to work as soon as they would have had the 
exemptions not been in place. The actual impact to the Trust Fm1d will depend on the number of individuals who take 
advantage of the exemptions. 
Higher benefit costs may impact future employer contribution rates if the impact to the Trust Fund results in a higher 
contribution rate schedule. The contribution rate schedule formula uses the balance of the Unemployment Trust Fund 
as of September 30 as a factor in detennining whether a change in the contribution rate schedule is required. Such a 
change would bring in an estimated $18.0 million annually from employers.
