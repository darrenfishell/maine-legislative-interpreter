whether or not the person who committed the assault is a family or household member or 35 
dating partner; the duration of the protection order may be for a fixed period not to 36 
exceed 2 years.  This bill expands the possible duration of a protection order for victims 37 
of sexual assault.  The bill provides a victim of a sexual assault described in Title 17 -A, 38 
chapter 11 the opportunity to petition for an order that is a fixed period of time that may 39

the kinds of relief that a court may order for a sexual assault victim the requirement that 2 
the defendant refrain from knowingly coming within or knowingly remaining within a 3 
specified di stance of a specified location.  4
