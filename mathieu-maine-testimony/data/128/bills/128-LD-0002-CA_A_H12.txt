FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "ft-,' to H.P. 4, L.D. 2, Bill, "An Act To Prevent 
Bad Faith Assertions of Patent fufringement" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 14 MRSA §8701, sub-§7, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 543, §1, is amended 
to read: 
7. Exemption. This section does not apply to a good faith demand letter or good 
faith assertion of patent infringement that iaeli:Jdes a elaim. for relief arising under 35 
United States Code, Section 271(e)(2) or 42 United States Code, Section 262.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is a minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. It 
replaces the bill, which eliminates the existing exemption for patent infringement claims 
that include claims for relief under the federal pharmaceutical approval statutes. This 
amendment narrows the exemption to apply to only good faith demand letters and good 
faith assertions of patent infringement arising under 35 United States Code, Section 
271(e)(2) or 42 United States Code, Section 262.
