WHEREAS, the concept of "first-generation college student," meaning a person neither of 
whose parents completed a baccalaureate degree, was  introduced into federal policy by the TRIO

Higher Education Act of 1965; and 
WHEREAS, "TRIO" refers to the federally funded programs, ori ginally 3, now 8, increasing 
access to higher education for economically disadva ntaged students; and 
WHEREAS, even in 2017, campuses and communities are too ofte n blind to the academic 
capabilities and gifts that lie dormant within so m any first-generation college students; and 
WHEREAS, TRIO educators continue to be called upon to highli ght the return on 
investment our country receives from providing firs t-generation college students an opportunity 
to reach their full potential through college; and 
WHEREAS, in response, the Council for Opportunity in Educati on, in partnership with the 
National Association of Student Personnel Administr ators - Student Affairs Administrators in 
Higher Education and other higher education organiz ations, is asking college access and success 
professionals to join with TRIO's Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program 
and Student Support Services projects across the co untry for the First Annual First-Generation 
College Celebration on November 8, 2017, which is t he 52nd anniversary of the federal Higher 
Education Act of 1965; now, therefore, be it 
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the Senate of the One Hundr ed and Twenty-eighth 
Legislature now assembled in the First Special Sess ion, on behalf of the people we represent, 
take this opportunity to recognize the First Annual  First-Generation College Celebration and the 
valuable contributions of first-generation college students to our communities.
