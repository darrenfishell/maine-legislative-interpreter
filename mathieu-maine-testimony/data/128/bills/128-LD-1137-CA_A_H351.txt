Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 4 to 7. 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or

SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provisions of the bill that expand crossbow hunting for 
deer into the regular archery-only season on deer and that remove the requirement that a 
person must have a valid hunting or archery hunting license or an apprenticeship hunter

season on that wild bird or wild animal, hunt in an expanded archery zone and hunt 
during muzzle-loading-only deer hunting season.
