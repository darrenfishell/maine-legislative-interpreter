SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. 
Rather than requiring a prescriber of opioid medication to inform a patient of the risks of 
addiction, it requires health care entities that include prescribers of opioid medications to 
develop an opioid medication prescribing policy that includes risk assessment, informed 
consent and counseling on the risk of opioid use. The policy must be developed by 
January 1, 2018.
