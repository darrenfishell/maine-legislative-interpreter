 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  18-A MRSA ยง5 -204, sub -ยง(d), as enacted by PL 2005, c. 371, ยง2, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
(d).  The person or persons whose consent is required under subsection (b) do not 4 
consent, but the cou rt finds by a preponderance of the  clear and convincing  evidence that 5 
there is a de facto guardian and a demonstrated lack of consistent participation by the 6 
nonconsenting parent or legal custodian of the unmarried minor.  The court may appoint 7 
the de fact o guardian as guardian if the appointment is in the best interest of the child.  8 
SUMMARY  9 
This bill changes, pursuant to a Law Court decision, the law regarding the 10 
appointment of a guardian for an unmarried minor.  Under the current law, the probate 11 
court m ay appoint a guardian without the consent of the minor's parents whose rights 12 
have not been terminated or the minor's legal custodian when the court finds by a 13 
preponderance of the evidence that there is a de facto guardian and a demonstrated lack 14 
of consi stent participation by the nonconsenting parent or legal custodian.  The bill 15 
changes the evidentiary standard from a preponderance of the evidence to clear and 16 
convincing evidence.  17
