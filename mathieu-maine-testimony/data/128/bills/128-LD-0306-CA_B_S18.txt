8 FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" B "to S.P. 92, L.D. 306, Bill, "An Act To Require 
10 State Compliance with Federal REAL ID Guidelines" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'Resolve, Directing the Secretary of State To Apply for an Extension under the 
13 Federal REAL ID Act of 2005' 
14 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
15 inserting the following: 
16 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
17 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
18 Whereas, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 was attached to a conference report on 
19 must-pass legislation regarding Iraq war funding and relief for the 2004 tsunami, 
20 bypassed state and stakeholder input and established robust measui;es for issuing licenses 
21 and nondriver identification cards; and 
22 Whereas, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 has never been funded to any 
23 significant degree by the Federal Government, and the Maine Secretary of State has 
24 estimated the state cost of REAL ID compliance will be between $2,000,000 and 
25 $3,000,000 of state funds; because of that, and the broad scope of federal intrusion into a 
26 process historically managed by the states, the Act was made voluntary for the states. 
27 However, now, the effect of noncompliance is that citizens in noncompliant states are not 
28 able to use their noncompliant credentials to access many federal or federally controlled 
29 facilities and services and soon will not be able to board commercial aircraft; and 
30 Whereas, the United States Department of Homeland Security has refused to extend 
31 the State of Maine's waiver and, as a result, Maine driver's licenses and nondriver 
32 identification cards are no longer accepted to access federal facilities as of January 30, 
33 2017 and will no longer be accepted to board commercial flights as of January 22, 2018, 
34 and anyone who is eligible for a REAL ID compliant driver's license or nondriver 
35 identification card is also eligible for other forms of identification that are accepted to 
36 access federal facilities and board commercial aircraft, namely passport books and

1 passport cards, which are valid for a period of 10 years for residents 16 years of age and 
2 older; and 
3 Whereas, Maine lawmakers continue to be appalled by the abrogation of the privacy 
4 and civil liberties of American citizens under the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 and even 
5 more appalled by the Act's lack of effectiveness in achieving its stated goals, which are to 
6 prevent future terrorist attacks in America and to prevent undocumented immigrants who 
7 come to America without clearance from enjoying the benefits of citizenship illegally. 
8 There is nothing in the Act's implementation that will achieve either of these goals; and 
9 Whereas, the Maine Department of Labor, less than a year ago, outsourced its 
10 federally mandated job-matching service to an out-of-state vendor, and recently that 
11 vendor has suffered a serious data breach in which an unknown number of Maine 
12 residents' most sensitive personal information, including names, dates of birth and social 
13 security numbers, was stolen, demonstrating the weakness of cybersecurity and the 
14 vulnerability of Maine residents and United States citizens to hacking and theft of 
15 sensitive data across the State and the nation, making it highly unlikely that the State of 
16 Maine can assure its residents with confidence that any database established pursuant to 
17 the requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 would, in fact, be safe and secure; 
18 and 
19 Whereas, Maine has a long, proud tradition of standing up for the fundamental right 
20 to privacy and it is the responsibility of the Legislature to look beyond the inconveniences 
21 of the day and consider the long-term effects and unintended consequences of complying 
22 with the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, which will have broad and far-reaching 
23 consequences for every American in the future; and 
24 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
25 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
26 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
27 therefore, be it 
28 Sec. 1. Secretary of State to request a waiver. Resolved: That, upon 
29 adjournment of the One Hundred Fifteenth United States Congress, the Secretary of State 
3 0 shall request a waiver of the requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 from the 
31 United States Department of Homeland Security pending the results of federal legislation 
32 relating to the federal REAL ID Act of2005; and be it further 
33 Sec. 2. Secretary of State to establish process to provide passport cards 
34 or passport books to residents requiring assistance. Resolved: That, beginning 
35 July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2019, the Secretary of State shall provide residents of 
36 the State who require financial assistance an opportunity to obtain a United States 
37 Department of State passport card or passport book upon completing an application and 
3 8 meeting specified criteria as determined by the Secretary of State. In lieu of the expected 
39 costs of implementation of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, the Secretary of State shall 
40 provide funding, in an amount up to $3,000,000, to make available United States 
41 Department of State passport cards or passport books to residents of the State who qualify 
42 under this section. The Secretary of State shall pay the cost of a United States 
43 Department of State passport card or passport book for a person who qualifies under this 
44 section and who:
