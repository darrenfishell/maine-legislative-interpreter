 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, while the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act prohibits the location of 3 
medical marijuana d ispensaries within 500 feet of a school, there are no such prohibitions 4 
placed on primary caregivers who cultivate medical marijuana for qualifying patients; 5 
and 6 
Whereas, without restrictions, the current law could be construed to permit a 7 
number of caregi vers to be located in the same facility, each cultivating up to 6 marijuana 8 
plants; and  9 
Whereas, the location of such a facility close to a school may pose a risk to minors 10 
passing that facility on their way to and from school, which is a risk that needs t o be 11 
addressed as soon as possible; and  12 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 13 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 14 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 15 
therefore,  16 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  17 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง2423 -A, sub -ยง13 is enacted to read:  18

the propert y line of a preexisting public or private school.  23 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 24 
legislation takes effect when approved.  25
