A.  All goods and services received prior to certification must be paid for with seed 13 
money contributions, except for goods and services that are excluded from the 14

than the  seed money collected, but may only receive that portion of goods and 19

candidate who has accepted contributions or made expenditures that do not comply 21 
with the seed money  restrictions under this chapter may petition the commission to 22 
remain eligible for certification as a Maine Clean Election Act candidate in 23 
accordance with rules of the commission, if the failure to comply was unintentional 24 
and does not constitute a signi ficant infraction of these restrictions.  25 
C.  Upon requesting certification, a participating candidate shall file a report of all 26 
seed money contributions and expenditures.  If the candidate is certified, any unspent 27 
seed money will be deducted from the amo unt distributed to the candidate as 28 
provided in subsection 8-F 8-G. 29

becomes a candidate and who is seeking certification under subsection 5, or an agent of 35 
that candidate, may not assist another person in qualifying as a candidate for the same 36 
office if such a candidacy would result in the distribution of revenues under subsections 7 37 
and 8-F 8-G for certified candidates in a contested election.  38

SUMMARY  36 
This bill changes funding distributions under the Maine Clean Election Act.  It 37 
removes the changes made to funding distributions in Initiated Bill 2015, chapter 1.  It 38 
restores the met hod of funding distributions that was in law prior to enactment of Initiated 39 
Bill 2015, chapter 1, which required the Commission on Governmental Ethics and 40 
Election Practices to determine the funding amount at least every 2 years and set a 41 
specific distrib ution for gubernatorial elections.  It differs from the method of funding 42 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR0506(01) -1 
 distributions in law prior to enactment of the initiated bill by limiting the information the 1 
commission may consider in making a determination.  It also eliminates supplemental 2 
fund distributions.  3
