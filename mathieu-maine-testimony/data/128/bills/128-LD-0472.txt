2.  Parental ri ghts and responsibilities; order.   This subsection governs parental 12 
rights and responsibilities and court orders for parental rights and responsibilities.  Unless 13 
it finds that a compelling state interest justifies limiting the rights of a parent, the cour t 14 
shall order shared parental rights and responsibilities.  An order limiting the rights of a 15 
parent must be narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest and must impose 16 
the least restrictive limitation necessary to achieve that interest.  17 
A.  When the parents have agreed to an award of shared parental rights and 18 
responsibilities or so agree in open court, the court shall make that award unless there 19 
is substantial evidence that it should not be ordered. The court shall state in its 20 
decision th e reasons for not ordering a shared parental rights and responsibilities 21 
award agreed to by the parents.  22 
B.  The court may award reasonable rights of contact with a minor child to a 3rd 23 
person.  24 
C.  The court may award parental rights and responsibilities w ith respect to the child 25 
to a 3rd person, a suitable society or institution for the care and protection of children 26 
or the department, upon a finding that awarding parental rights and responsibilities to 27 
either or both parents will place the child in jeopa rdy as defined in Title 22, section 28 
4002, subsection 6.  29 
D.  The order of the court awarding parental rights and responsibilities must include 30 
the following:  31 
(1)  Allocated parental rights and responsibilities, shared parental rights and 32 
responsibilities or  sole parental rights and responsibilities, according to the best 33 
interest of the child as provided in subsection 3.  An award of shared parental 34 
rights and responsibilities may include either an allocation of the child's primary 35 
residential care to one pa rent and rights of parent -child contact to the other 36 
parent, or a sharing of the child's primary residential care by both parents.  If 37 
either or both parents request an award of shared primary residential care and the 38 
court does not award shared primary re sidential care of the child, the court shall 39 
state in its decision the reasons why shared primary residential care is not in the 40 
best interest of the child;  41 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1057(01) -1 
 (2)  Conditions of parent -child contact in cases involving domestic abuse as 1 
provided in subsection  6; 2 
(3)  A provision for child support as provided in subsection 8 or a statement of 3 
the reasons for not ordering child support;  4 
(4)  A statement that each parent must have access to records and information 5 
pertaining to a minor child, including, but not l imited to, medical, dental and 6 
school records and other information on school activities, whether or not the 7 
child resides with the parent, unless that access is found not to be in the best 8 
interest of the child or that access is found to be sought for the  purpose of causing 9 
detriment to the other parent. If that access is not ordered, the court shall state in 10 
the order its reasons for denying that access;  11 
(5)  A statement that violation of the order may result in a finding of contempt 12 
and imposition of san ctions as provided in subsection 7; and  13 
(6)  A statement of the definition of shared parental rights and responsibilities 14 
contained in section 1501, subsection 5, if the order of the court awards shared 15 
parental rights and responsibilities.  16 
An order modify ing a previous order is not required to include provisions of the 17 
previous order that are not modified.  18 
E.  The order of the court may not include a requirement that the State pay for the 19 
defendant to attend a batterers' intervention program unless the pro gram is certified 20 
under section 4014.  21 
SUMMARY  22 
This bill amends the law to stipulate that parents have a fundamental right to make 23 
decisions concerning the upbringing, education and care of their minor children and 24 
prevents courts from limiting these fundam ental parental rights unless the limitation is 25 
supported by a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to serve that interest 26 
through the least restrictive means possible.  27
