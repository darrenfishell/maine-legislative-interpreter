HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 770, L.D. 1096, Bill, "An Act To 
Improve Shoreland Zoning Rules and Enforcement To Support Municipalities" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Require a Photographic Record for Developments within the Shoreland 
Zone' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 1 to 3. 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, changes the title and 
amends the bill as follows. 
1. It strikes the requirement that the Department of Economic and Community 
Development, Office of Community Development provide advanced training to code 
enforcement officers. 
2. It strikes the proposed increases in the maximum per day civil penalty for specific 
violations of certain municipal land use laws or ordinances. 
3. It retains the provision that municipal shoreland zoning ordinances must require 
an applicant for a permit for development within the shoreland zone to provide to the 
municipal permitting authority preconstruction and postconstruction photographs of the 
shoreline vegetation and development site. 
The fiscal note on this amendment identifies as a potential state mandate certain 
requirements in the amendment relating to photographic records of developments within 
the shoreland zone. To be considered a mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, a 
provision must require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as 
to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The members of the committee 
voting for this report find that the provisions identified in the fiscal note as a potential

To amend and enforce municipal zoning ordinances to require photographic records. Municipality Moderate 
statewide 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: ( 1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection as a result of the amendments to and enforcement 
of municipal zoning ordinances requiring photographic records are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
