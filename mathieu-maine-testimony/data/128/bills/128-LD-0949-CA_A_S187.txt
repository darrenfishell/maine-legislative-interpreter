12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment is the majority report of the committee and does the following. 
14 1. It removes the provision in the bill requiring insurers to provide professional 
15 liability insurance coverage for health care services provided through telehealth services 
16 in the same manner as the coverage is provided for face-to-face contact between a health 
17 care practitioner and a patient. 
18 2. It clarifies that carriers may only apply prior approval and credentialing 
19 requirements for providers for services provided through telehealth services if the 
20 requirements are the same as are applied for services provided in person. 
21 3. It removes the provision requiring carriers to notify enrollees and prospective 
22 enrollees about coverage for telehealth services because carriers are already required to 
23 provide enrollees and prospective enrollees information about benefits and coverage. 
24 4. It makes the bill's provisions apply to health insurance policies issued or renewed 
25 on or after January 1, 2019.

An Act Regarding Telehealth 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment "p';,' 
Committee: Insurance and Financial Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost increase -All Funds 
The bill has an effective date of January 1, 2019, so only contracts executed after January 1, 2019 will be required to 
meet the coverage in this bill. Currently, within the State Employee Health Plan (SEHP), telehealth services are 
consistent with coverage for in-person services and with providers acting in his/her scope of practice. Begilllling with 
the SEHP contract for fiscal year 2019-20, the telehealth service requirements will be expanded and there is a 
potential for an increase in costs to the SEHP. It is expected that some number of services will be shifted to telehealth 
from an in-office visit and will have no cost impact to the SEHP. However, there may also be additional services 
covered via telehealth that would never have been provided in an office. It is not know how many additional services 
will be provided through this expanded telehealth offering and no estimate of cost is made at this time.
