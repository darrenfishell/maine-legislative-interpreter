SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment makes the following changes to 
the process for the appeal of tax assessments to the State Board of Property Tax Review. 
The amendment clarifies a tax assessor's authority to request a true and perfect list of 
property and to request additional information from taxpayers. It revises existing 
confidentiality restrictions to clarify that assessors may share confidential information 
with other municipal officials, attorneys, consultants and other persons involved in an 
appeal or approved by the taxpayer. It provides that the position of one public member of 
the board must be filled by a person with expertise in taxation, finance or property 
valuation matters and permits current assessors, as well as retired assessors, to be 
members of the board. If a taxpayer files an appeal with the board, the board may not 
schedule a hearing until after mediation between the taxpayer and the assessor has been 
completed, unless the parties have been excused by the board. 
The amendment establishes the Task Force To Restructure and Improve the 
Efficiency of the State Board of Property Tax Review. Its duties are to study, assess and 
evaluate the process of and duties assigned to the State Board of Property Tax Review 
and to make recommendations for restructuring the board to improve the efficiency of the 
appeal process. The task force must submit a report with its findings and 
recommendations to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
over taxation matters, which may report out legislation to the First Regular Session of the 
129th Legislature. 
The amendment also adds a mandate preamble.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services associated with serving on the task force 
and developing and reporting recommendations can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
