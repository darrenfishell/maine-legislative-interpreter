may not be filed against an elected official duri ng the last 6 months of the official’s term 15

duties of the office until the result of the recall election is certified.  17 
§1302.  Recall petition; number of signatures  18 
A petition to recall an elected official must be signed by a number of voters of the 19 
district in which the official is elected equal to not less than 15% of the number of votes 20 
cast for candidates for that office at the last preceding election in the electo ral district of 21 
the elected official.  The party affiliation of signatories to a petition must be proportional 22 
to the party affiliation of the voters who cast votes for candidates for that office at the last 23 
preceding election in the electoral district of the elected official.  24 
§1303.  Recall of senators, representatives, elected state officials and certain county 25

 §1305.  Sufficiency or insufficiency of recall petition; determination; notice; special 1 
election  2 
1.  Determination of sufficiency.   Within 35 days after the filing of a recall petition 3 
under this chapter, the filing official with whom the recall petition is filed shall make an 4 
official declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition. If the r ecall petition 5 
is determined to be insufficient, the filing official shall notify the person or organization 6 
sponsoring the recall of the insufficiency of the petition. It is not necessary to give 7 
notification unless the person or organization sponsoring t he recall files with the filing 8 
official a written notice of sponsorship and a mailing address.  9 
2.  Calling of recall election.   Immediately upon determining pursuant to subsection 10 
1 that a petition is sufficient, but not later than 35 days after the date of the filing of the 11 
petition, the filing official with whom the petition is filed shall call a recall election to 12 
determine whether the voters will recall the official whose recall is sought. The election 13 
must be held on the next regular election date tha t is not less than 95 days after the date 14

§1306.  Recall election procedure  16 
The procedure governing a recall election under this chapter is the same, so far as 17 
possible and unless otherwise provided in rules adopted implementing this  chapter, as 18

manner provided in this chapter. Fewer precinct e lection officials than the number 24

§1307.  Recall of elected official; vac ancy  27 
After a recall election held pursuant to section 1306, if the results support the recall 28 
of the elected official, the official empowered by law to perform the duties of that 29 
recalled official in the event of that official's absence, death, illness or inability to act 30 
shall perform and discharge the duties of the office vacated until a successor is duly 31 
elected and qualified. If the power to fill a vacancy by appointment exists, the office must 32 
be filled in the same manner by temporary appointment until  a successor is duly elected 33 
and qualified. If there is no official empowered by law to perform the duties of the 34 
recalled official and there is no existing power to fill the vacancy by appointment, the 35 
Governor may appoint a person to fill the vacancy unt il the recalled official's successor is 36 
elected and qualified.  37 
§1308.  Rulemaking  38 
The Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices and the 39
