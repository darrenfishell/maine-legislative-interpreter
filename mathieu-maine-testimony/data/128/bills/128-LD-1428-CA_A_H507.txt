Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill shifts incarceration costs from the county and regional jails to the Department of Corrections for 
approximately 300 prisoners. The department will require significant General Fund appropriations. The amount 
needed will depend in part on the department's decision on where the additional prisoners are ultimately located. The 
department has estimated the additional cost to be around $22 million, with most of that recurring annually.
