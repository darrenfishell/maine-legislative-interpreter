 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3737, sub -§4 is enacted to read:  2 
4.  Child care rates.  The department shall establish payment rates for child care 3 
services that are at least equal to the 75th percentile of l ocal market rates for the various 4 
categories of child care services.  The payment rates for child care services for children 5 
with special needs must be higher than the 75th percentile of local market rates.  6 
Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3762, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by  PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. RRRR, 7 
§2, is further amended to read:  8 
B.  The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in 9 
accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 10 
this purpose or a combina tion of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 11 
families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance for families described in this 12 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  13 
(1)  To continue the pass -through of the first $5 0 per month of current child 14 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 15 
tests and benefit calculations;  16 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 17 
States who are receiving assistanc e under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  18 
Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of 19 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 20 
aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF pr ogram for these categories of 21 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 22 
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  23 
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that h ousehold 24 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 25 
for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 26 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 27 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 28 
through a state -funded program unless that noncitizen is:  29 
(a)  Elderly or disabled, as described under the laws governing supplemental 30 
security income in 42 United States Code,  Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);  31 
(b)  A victim of domestic violence;  32 
(c)  Experiencing other hardship, such as time necessary to obtain proper 33 
work documentation, as defined by the department by rule. Rules adopted by 34 
the department under this division are  routine technical rules as defined by 35 
Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A; or  36 
(d)  Unemployed but has obtained proper work documentation, as defined by 37 
the department by rule.  Rules adopted by the department under this division 38 
are routine technical rul es as defined by Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A; 39 
(3) To provide benefits to certain 2 -parent families whose deprivation is based on 40 
physical or mental incapacity;  41 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0585(01) -1 
 (4)  To provide an assistance program for needy children, 19 to 21 years of age, 1 
who ar e in full -time attendance in secondary school.  The program is operated for 2 
those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United States Social Security 3 
Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the 4 
parent or careta ker relative of those individuals.  Except for the age requirement, 5 
all provisions of TANF, including the standard of need and the amount of 6 
assistance, apply to the program established pursuant to this subparagraph;  7 
(5)  To provide assistance for a pregna nt woman who is otherwise eligible for 8 
assistance under this chapter, except that she has no dependents under 19 years of 9 
age.  An individual is eligible for the monthly benefit for one eligible person if 10 
the medically substantiated expected date of the bi rth of her child is not more 11 
than 90 days following the date the benefit is received;  12 
(6)  To provide a special housing allowance for TANF families whose shelter 13 
expenses for rent, mortgage or similar payments, homeowners insurance and 14 
property taxes equal  or exceed 75% of their monthly income.  The special 15 
housing allowance is limited to $200 per month for each family.  For purposes of 16 
this subparagraph, "monthly income" means the total of the TANF monthly 17 
benefit and all income countable under the TANF pr ogram, plus child support 18 
received by the family, excluding the $50 pass -through payment;  19 
(7)  In determining benefit levels for TANF recipients who have earnings from 20 
employment, the department shall disregard from monthly earnings the 21 
following:  22 
(a)  One  hundred and eight dollars;  23 
(b)  Fifty percent of the remaining earnings that are less than the federal 24 
poverty level; and  25 
(c)  All actual child care costs necessary for work, except that the department 26 
may limit the child care disregard to $175 per month per child or $200 per 27 
month per child under 2 years of age or with special needs;  28 
(7-A)  In determining eligibility and benefit levels, the department may apply a 29 
gross income test only to applicants and not to recipients;  30 
(8)  In cases when the TANF recip ient has no child care cost, the monthly TANF 31 
benefit is the maximum payment level or the difference between the countable 32 
earnings and the standard of need established by rule adopted by the department, 33 
whichever is lower;  34 
(9)  In cases when the TANF reci pient has child care costs, the department shall 35 
determine a total benefit package, including TANF cash assistance, determined in 36 
accordance with subparagraph (7) and additional child care assistance, as 37 
provided by rule, necessary to cover the TANF recipi ent's actual child care costs 38 
up to the maximum amount specified in section 3782 -A, subsection 5 , paragraph 39 
B.  The benefit amount must be paid as provided in this subparagraph.  40 
(a)  Before the first month in which child care assistance is available to an 41 
ASPIRE -TANF recipient under this paragraph and periodically thereafter, the 42 
department shall notify the recipient of the total benefit package and the 43 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0585(01) -1 
 following options of the recipient: to receive the total benefit package 1 
directly; or to have the departm ent pay the recipient's child care assistance 2 
directly to the designated child care provider for the recipient and pay the 3 
balance of the total benefit package to the recipient.  4 
(b)  If an ASPIRE -TANF recipient notifies the department that the recipient 5 
chooses to receive the child care assistance directly, the department shall pay 6 
the total benefit package to the recipient.  7 
(c)  If an ASPIRE -TANF recipient does not respond or notifies the 8 
department of the choice to have the child care assistance paid dire ctly to the 9 
child care provider from the total benefit package, the department shall pay 10 
the child care assistance directly to the designated child care provider for the 11 
recipient.  The department shall pay the balance of the total benefit package 12 
to the r ecipient;  13 
(10)  Child care assistance under this paragraph must be paid by the department 14 
in a prompt manner that permits an ASPIRE -TANF recipient to access child care 15 
necessary for work; and  16 
(11)  The department shall adopt rules pursuant to Title 5, chap ter 375 to 17 
implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subparagraph are 18 
routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 19
