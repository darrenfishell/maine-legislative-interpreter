The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $8,250 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $11,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 
the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to support the anticipated increase in costs resulting from 
additional prosecutions involving death or serious bodily injury to a person. 
Under cutTent statute, the court determines the disposition of forfeited property and may order it deposited to the 
General Fund or that it go to a municipality, county, or state agency that has made a substantial contribution to the 
investigation or prosecution of a related criminal case. This bill keeps that language and adds to the court's options by 
also allowing disposition of forfeited property to, upon request of the investigating agency or prosecuting agency, a 
law enforcement agency in this State that provides case management and other social services to persons with 
substance use disorders. In any future case where the cou1i will opt to use the new provision to redirect forfeited 
property from the General Fund to a local law enforcement agency, revenue will be increased to the receiving agency 
and reduced to the General Fund. No estimate of the amounts redirected can be made at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services from the provisions of this bill are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
