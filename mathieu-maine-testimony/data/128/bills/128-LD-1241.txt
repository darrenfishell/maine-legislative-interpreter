 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  18-A MRSA §3 -906, sub -§(a), as amended by PL 1997, c. 73, §3 and 2 
affected by §4, is further amended to read:  3 
(a).    Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will and except as p rovided in 4 
section 3 -917, the distributable assets of a decedent's estate must be distributed as 5 
follows.  6 
(1).  A specific devisee must receive the thing devised to that devisee, and a spouse or 7 
child who has selected particular assets of an estate as prov ided in section 2 -402 must 8 
receive the items selected.  9 
(2).  Any homestead or family allowance or pecuniary devise may be satisfied by 10 
value in kind, in the personal representative's discretion, if:  11 
(i)  The person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash;  12 
(ii)  The property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date 13 
of its distribution; and  14 
(iii)  No residuary devisee has requested that the asset to be distributed remain a 15 
part of the residue of the estate or if, a residuary devisee has requested that the 16 
asset to be distributed remain a part of the residue of the estate, there are 17 
insufficient other assets to which no residuary devisee has made such a request to 18 
permit satisfaction of the estate's obligations and fu nding of all pecuniary devises 19 
made under the decendent's  decedent's  will. 20 
(3).  For the purpose of valuation under paragraph (2), securities regularly traded on 21 
recognized exchanges, if distributed in kind, are valued at the price for the last sale of 22 
like securities traded on the business day prior to distribution or, if there was no sale 23 
on that day, at the median between amounts bid and offered at the close of that day.  24 
Assets consisting of sums owed the decedent or the estate by solvent debtors as to 25 
which there is no known dispute or defense are valued at the sum due with accrued 26 
interest or discounted to the date of distribution.  For assets that do not have readily 27 
ascertainable values, a valuation as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the dat e 28 
of distribution, if otherwise reasonable, controls. For purposes of facilitating 29 
distribution, the personal representative may ascertain the value of the assets as of the 30 
time of the proposed distribution in any reasonable way, including the employment o f 31 
qualified appraisers, even if the assets may have been previously appraised.  32 
(4).  The residuary estate may be distributed by the personal representative in cash or 33 
in kind, in accordance with the best interests of the residuary devisees.  Residuary 34 
assets may be distributed, at the personal representative's discretion, in pro rata or non 35 
pro rata shares; except that residuary assets not distributed pro rata must be valued as 36 
of the date on which they are distributed.  37 
Sec. 2.  18-A MRSA §3 -911, as enacted  by PL 1979, c. 540, §1, is amended to 38 
read:  39

 §3-911.  Partition for purpose of distribution  1 
When 2 or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in 2 
any real or personal property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of 3

estate, to make partition.  The personal representative shall notify the court of any lien 5 
that may be imposed pursuant to section 3 -917 against an h eir's or a devisee's interest in 6 
the property.   After notice to the interested heirs or devisees and to the Department of 7 
Health and Human Services if the court determines that the interest of an interested heir 8 
or devisee may be subject to a lien pursuant  to section 3 -917, the court shall partition the 9 
property in the same manner as provided by the law for civil actions of partition. The 10 
court may direct the personal representative to sell any property which  that cannot be 11 
partitioned without prejudice to the owners and which  that cannot conveniently be 12
