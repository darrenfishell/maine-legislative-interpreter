STATE OF MAINE  
128TH MAINE LEGISLATURE
JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MARCH 5-11, 2017 AS 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK 
WHEREAS, multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a neurological disease of the central nervous 
system affecting 2,300,000 people worldwide; and   
WHEREAS,  the Greater  New  England  Chapter  of the National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society 
reports that more than 3,000 people are living with MS in the State and that the disease generally 
strikes  people  in the prime  of life, between  20 and 50 years  of age, and  the cause  and course  of 
the often debilitating symptoms of MS remain unknown and no cure currently exists; and  
WHEREAS,  the National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society  has been  committed  for more  than  70 
years  to a world  free  of MS, heightening  public  knowledge  about  and insight  into  the disease; 
and  
WHEREAS, since 1946 the N
ational Multiple Sclerosis Society has been a driving force of MS research, relentlessly 
pursuing prevention, treatments and a cure, and has invested more than $900,000,000 in 
groundbreaking research; and 
WHEREAS, funds raised through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society provide 
$42,100,000 in funding for 380 research projects at the best medical centers, universities and 
other institutions throughout the United States and abroad, leading to many breakthroughs in the 
treatment of MS; and  
WHEREAS, stopping MS in its tracks, restoring what has been lost and ending MS forever 
is the mission of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and one that all Americans and citizens 
of the State should support; now, therefore, be it 
RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature 
now assembled in the First Regular Session, take this occasion to recognize the importance of 
finding the cause and cure of MS, to express our appreciation for the dedication that the Greater 
New England Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has shown toward creating a 
world free of MS and to declare March 5-11, 2017 as Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week in the 
State; and be it further 
RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the Secretary of 
State, be transmitted to the Greater New England Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis 
Society.
