17 origination in accordance with the interest  rate set forth  in section 12942 and that

21 the State,  to the  higher rate set  forth in section 12942, subsection 1.

23 consolidation or refinancing interest rate reduction component of the program does not 
24 remain residing and working in the State  for a minimum of 5 years, all rate reduction 
25 payments made  by the authority must be repaid by that recipient within 90 days.   If a 
26 recipient no longer resides  and works in the State after the initial 5-year period,  that

9 SUMMARY
10 The funds provided by this bond  issue, in the amount of $50,000,000, will be used to 
11 provide funds to the Finance Authority  of Maine for zero-interest  student loans and loan 
12 consolidation or refinancing interest  rate reductions  for certain  Maine residents who agree 
13 to live and work in Maine  for at least 5 years. The bill creates the Maine  Student Loan  
14 Debt Relief Program. Under the program, zero-interest loans  up to $10,000 per year for a 
15 maximum of 5 years are available to certain  Maine  residents who study at qualified in-
16 state institutions of higher  education  and agree to live and work in Maine for at least 5 
17 years following  graduation. Loans  bearing  an annual interest rate of the prime rate of 
18 interest plus 2% are available to those who do not live and work  in the State  upon 
19 graduation.  The Finance Authority of Maine may provide interest  rate reduction 
20 payments to residents who use the authority's  existing  loan consolidation  and refinancing 
21 program. This option is available  to individuals who studied in Maine  or outside of Maine 
22 and agree to live and work in Maine for at least 5 years. The bill exempts from Maine 
23 income tax any benefits  received under the program to the extent  included in federal  
24 adjusted gross income and prohibits  individuals who have  received benefits  under the 
25 program from receiving the Maine  educational  opportunity tax credit.
