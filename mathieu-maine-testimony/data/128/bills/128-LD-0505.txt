This bill amends the laws governing adoption to eliminate the provision of law that 36 
requires that upon adoption of a person born in Maine, unless the adoptive parents or 37 
adopted person who is at least 18 years of age requests otherwise, the original birth  38 
certificate of the adopted person be sealed and a new certificate showing the adoptive 39 
parents as the parents of birth be created.  40
