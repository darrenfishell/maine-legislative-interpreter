become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, accidents and violence related to firearms are pervasive throughout our 3 
society; and  4 
Where as, certain places that serve the public, such as hospitals, have an interest in 5 
restricting the use and possession of firearms in the interest of public safety; and  6 
Whereas, expediency in enacting restrictions on firearm use and possession on 7 
hospital pro perty can better ensure that a tragic accident or act of violence does not occur; 8
