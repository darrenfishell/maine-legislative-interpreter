2 The board department shall  work with the department and the Department of

4 water source program  in accordance with this section.  The Board of Environmental 
5 Protection shall determine flow standards through rulemaking authorized under Title  38, 
6 section 470-H.
7 1.  Site-specific standards.  Upon request of the board, the department  or a person 
8 using or proposing  to use surface waters for agricultural  purposes, the Department of 
9 Environmental Protection  shall determine site-specific flow standards  and water levels for 
10 a water  body used or being  considered for use  as a water source for  agriculture.
11 2.  Compliance  date for water use standards.  An agricultural  producer  has 5 years 
12 from the effective date of rules adopted under  Title 38, section 470-H to meet  the 
13 standards established in those  rules  if that agricultural producer is:
14 A.  An agricultural  producer who has filed or whose predecessor had filed a water use 
15 report under  Title 38, section  470-D prior to December 1st of the year in which  rules  
16 authorized by Title 38, section 470-H are finally adopted; or
17 B.  An agricultural producer who can otherwise document a history of agricultural 
18 water use at the site prior to December 1st of the year in which rules  authorized by 
19 Title 38, section 470-H are  finally adopted.
20 An agricultural  producer who has or whose  predecessor had a permit  or voluntary 
21 agreement establishing withdrawal limits  must adhere to those limits for the 5-year period  
22 or until in compliance  with the standards established  in rule.
23 For the purposes of this subsection, "predecessor" means a person who preceded  an 
24 agricultural producer in the  ownership or  use of  a parcel of land.
25 3.  Assistance to agricultural producers.   Agricultural producers  may seek 
26 assistance from the board  department for the development of sustainable  water sources, 
27 including permitting assistance  where applicable. An agricultural producer must have an 
28 agricultural water use management plan prior to receiving financial support for the 
29 development of an  alternative  water  source.
30 4.  Compliance extension.  The Department  of Environmental Protection, upon 
31 recommendation of the board  department, may grant an extension beyond  the original  5 
32 years to an agricultural producer who qualifies for the 5-year compliance date under 
33 subsection 2 and has a strategy  for compliance with the rules authorized by Title  38, 
34 section 470-H if:
35 A.  The agricultural producer requesting the extension has an agricultural water  use 
36 management plan consistent with the board's  model developed under section 352, 
37 subsection 3;
38 B.  The agricultural  water use management  plan identifies water  storage  options  for 
39 the agricultural producer  and alternative water sources;
40 C.  The agricultural producer has  applied for  funding  and permits as needed;
Page 4 - 128LR2906(01)-11 D.  The agricultural  producer has implemented all feasible  water  use reduction 
2 options that are consistent  with the  agricultural  water use management plan;
3 E.  The agricultural producer has complied with water  withdrawal limits established  
4 in an existing permit or voluntary  agreement;  and
5 F.  Unforeseen or exceptional circumstances, such as weather events, delays in 
6 federal permitting  or federal cost-share funding, have prevented implementation of 
7 the agricultural water use  management plan.
8 5.  Enforcement.   The board department shall examine water withdrawals  for 
9 agricultural uses that result in a violation  of flow rates  or water levels,  consider  any 
10 unforeseen or exceptional circumstances of the agricultural  producers, withdrawing water 
11 from the water  bodies and make recommendations to the Department of Environmental 
12 Protection regarding compliance. Nothing in the responsibilities or actions  of the board 
13 department limits  the enforcement or compliance authority of the Department of 
14 Environmental Protection under Title 38.
15 6.  Biennial report.  The board department shall submit  a report  on the sustainable  
16 agricultural water source program  to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
17 having jurisdiction over agricultural matters and the joint standing committee of the 
18 Legislature having  jurisdiction over natural  resources matters  by January 30th of 
19 odd-numbered years beginning January  30, 2007.
