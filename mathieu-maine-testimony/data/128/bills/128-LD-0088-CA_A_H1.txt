23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment strikes the definition of "cannabis" from the Marijuana Legalization 
25 Act. It amends the definition of "marijuana" and adds a definition of "marijuana 
26 concentrate." The amendment adds a provision to the Marijuana Legalization Act that 
27 prohibits a person from possessing more than 5 grams of marijuana concentrate as part of 
28 the 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana that a person may already legally possess under the Act. 
29 This amendment strikes a provision in the bill that, prior to February 1, 2018, limited 
30 personal marijuana consumption to a private residence. The amendment provides that 
31 personal marijuana consumption by a person 21 years of age or older may occur only in a 
32 private residence or on private property with permission of the owner. It further provides 
33 that consumption may not occur in a motor vehicle or in a private residence that is used 
34 as a day care or baby-sitting service during the hours of operation. 
35 For the purpose of adopting major substantive rules relating to the retail framework 
36 under the Marijuana Legalization Act, which are required to be submitted within 9 
3 7 months of the effective date of the Act, the amendment allows the Commissioner of 
38 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to delegate rule-making authority to the 
39 Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services or the Commissioner of Public 
40 Safety if the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry determines that the

1 expertise and resources of those other departments would be beneficial in the 
2 development of the rules. 
3 The amendment also provides that possession of marijuana is a civil violation for a 
4 person who is 18, 19 or 20 years of age. The penalty for possession of up to 1 1/4 ounces 
5 of marijuana is a fine no less than $350 to no more than $600. The penalty for possession 
6 of up to 2 1/2 ounces is a fine of no less than $700 and no more than $1,000. These 
7 penalties are the same as those that were in law for any nonjuvenile prior to being 
8 repealed by Initiated Bill 2015, chapter 5. Finally, the amendment provides that it is a 
9 juvenile crime under the Maine Juvenile Code for a person under 18 years of age to 
10 possess marijuana and makes a corresponding technical cross-reference change.

This bill delays the effective date ofretail sales of recreational marijuana to February 1, 2018. This delay would 
reduce revenue from the tax on marijuana sales, reducing General Fund revenue and Local Government Fund revenue 
by an estimated $490,000 and $10,000, respectively, in fiscal year 2017-18. 
The state licensing authority, still the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF), can delay 
expenditures of approximately $132,633 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $2,379,534 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 3 permanent 
positions in fiscal year 2017-18 and an additional 15 permanent positions (18 total) in fiscal year 2018-19, related 
costs and certain one-time costs to regulate and control the licensing of the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, 
testing and sale ofretail marijuana and retail marijuana products. As these amounts have not yet been appropriated to 
ACF, no deappropriations are required for the delay in this bill. Additional legislation will still be required to fund the 
licensing and enforcement functions of implementing the legalization of marijuana. 
The bill also allows ACF to delegate rulemaking authority to the Commissioner of the Department of Administrative 
and Financial Services or the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, or both, if there is a determination 
that the expertise and resources of those departments would benefit the rules and the enforcement of the Marijuana 
Legalization Act. 
Establishing civil violations for persons 18, 19 and 20 years of age who possess marijuana may increase fine revenue 
by amounts that are not expected to be significant.
