FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 13, L.D. 12, Bill, "An Act To 
Incorporate Protections for Living Donors into Maine Law" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1. 
Amend the bill in section 2 in ยง2159-D in subsection 2 in paragraph Din the next to 
the last line (page 2, line 1 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "risk" and inserting the 
following: 'justification' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment adjusts language in section 2 of the bill to clarify that insurers may 
not discriminate in the offering, issuance, cancellation, amount of coverage, price or other 
condition of a life insurance, disability insurance or long-term care insurance policy 
based solely and without any additional actuarial justification upon the status of an 
individual as a living organ donor. 
The amendment also removes the section of the bill that requires the Department of 
Health and Human Services to establish, maintain and operate an information service to 
educate the public on live organ donation.
