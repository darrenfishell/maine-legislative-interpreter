Fiscal Note 
Current biennium revenue increase -Municipalities 
Removing the property tax exemption status of land trust organizations and allowing the assessment of service 
charges against certain nonprofits would increase revenue to municipalities. Reducing the rate of excise tax for the 
first two years while increasing the rate for the last four years would result in revenue increases or decreases to 
municipalities by year depending on the age of motor vehicles in the municipality.
