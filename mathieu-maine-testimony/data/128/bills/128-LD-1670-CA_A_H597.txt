'2. Sufficient existing relationship. "Sufficient existing relationship" means a

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. It

sufficient existing relationship with the child or the existence of any other compelling 
state interest that justifies the court's interference with the parent's fundamental right to 
deny the grandparent access to the child. 
The amendment also removes reference to the de facto parentage standard in the bill's 
definition of the type of sufficient existing relationship that confers standing on a 
grandparent. Under the amendment, "sufficient existing relationship" is defined as a 
relationship involving extraordinaiy contact between the grandparent and the child, 
including but not limited to circumstances where the grandpai·ent has been a primary 
caregiver and custodian of the child for a significant period of time. This definition of 
"sufficient existing relationship" is intended to codifiy the Law Court1s decisions in 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 2000 ME 198, 761 A.2d 291, and Robichaud v. Pariseau, 2003 ME 
54, 820 A.2d 1212. 
The amendment also clarifies that a grandparent's ability to join with 2 or more other 
persons and file a child protection petition is not limited by the Grandparents Visitation 
Act.
