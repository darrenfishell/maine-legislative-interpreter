CONFERENCE AMENDMENT  B.  Subject to paragraph A, an employer's contribution rate for the 12 -month period 1 
commencing January 1st of each year is based upon the employer's experience rating 2 
record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.  The employer's reserve 3 
ratio is the percent obtained by dividing the amount, if any, by which the employer's 4 
contributions, credited from the time the employer first or most recently became an 5 
employer, wh ichever date is later, up to and including June 30th of the preceding 6 
year, including any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or 7 
before July 31st of that year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same 8 
period, by the  employer's average annual payroll for the period of 36 consecutive 9 
months ending June 30th of the preceding year.  The employer's contribution rate is 10 
determined under subparagraphs (1) to (8).  11 
 (1)  The commissioner shall prepare a schedule listing all e mployers for whom a 12 
reserve ratio has been computed pursuant to this paragraph, in the order of their 13 
reserve ratios, beginning with the highest ratio.  For each employer, the schedule 14 
must show:  15 
(a)  The amount of the employer's reserve ratio;  16 
(b)  The am ount of the employer's annual taxable payroll; and  17 
(c)  A cumulative total consisting of the amount of the employer's annual 18 
taxable payroll plus the amount of the annual taxable payrolls of all other 19 
employers preceding the employer on the list.  20 
(2)  The commissioner shall segregate employers into contribution categories in 21 
accordance with the cumulative totals under subparagraph (1), division (c).  The 22 
contribution category is determined by the cumulative payroll percentage limits 23 
in column B.  Each contr ibution category is identified by the contribution 24 
category number in column A that is opposite the figures in column B, which 25 
represent the percentage limits of each contribution category.  If an employer's 26 
taxable payroll falls in more than one contribut ion category, the employer must 27 
be assigned to the lower -numbered contribution category, except that an 28 
employer may not be assigned to a higher contribution category than is assigned 29 
any other employer with the same reserve ratio.  30

(3-A)  Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner shall compute a reserve 14 
multiple to determine the schedule and planned yield in effect for a rate year. The 15 
reserve multiple is determined by dividing the fund reserve ratio by the average 16 
benefit cost rate. The determination date is October 31st of each calendar year.  17 
The schedule and planned yield that apply for the 12 -month period commencing 18 
on January 1, 20 08 and every January 1st thereafter are shown on the line of the 19 
following table that corresponds with the applicable reserve multiple in column 20

(4)  The commissioner shall compute the predetermined yield by multiplying the 33 
ratio of total wages to taxable wages for the preceding cal endar year by the 34 
planned yield.  35 
(5)  The commissioner shall determine the contribution rates effective for a rate 36 
year by multiplying the predetermined yield by the experience factors for each 37 
contribution category.  Contribution category 20 in the table in subparagraph (2) 38 
must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%.  The employer's experience 39 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) that 40 
corresponds with the employer's contribution category in column A, except  that 41

CONFERENCE AMENDMENT  years 2002 and 2003.  Beginning January 1, 2018, for rate years when schedule A 1 
is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3 -A), the experience factor in 2 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of 3 
0.00 in column C.  4 
(6)  If, subsequent to the assignment of contribution rates for a rate year, the 5 
reserve ratio of an employer is recomputed and changed, the employer must be 6 
placed in the position on the schedule prepared pursuant to subparagraph (1) that 7 
the employer would have occupied had the corrected reserve ratio been shown on 8 
the schedule.  The altered posit ion on the schedule does not affect the position of 9 
any other employer.  10 
(7)  In computing the contribution rates, only the wages reported by employers 11 
liable for payment of contributions into the fund and net benefits paid that are 12 
charged to an employer's  experience rating record or to the fund are considered in 13 
the computation of the average benefit cost rate and the ratio of total wages to 14 
taxable wages.  15 
(8)  Beginning January 1, 2008, all contribution rates must be reduced by the 16 
Competitive Skills Scho larship Fund predetermined yield as defined in section 17 
1166, subsection 1, paragraph C, except that contribution category 20 under this 18
