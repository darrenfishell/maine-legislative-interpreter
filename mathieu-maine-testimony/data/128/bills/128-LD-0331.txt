SUMMARY  6 
This bill is a recommendation of the Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission 7 
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18 -A, section 1 -803, subsection 2.  8 
The bill addresses the rights of a charitable organization to enforce  a trust of which it 9 
is a beneficiary.  The Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18 -B, section 110 provides that a 10 
charitable organization is considered a qualified beneficiary of the trust if it would be 11 
considered a distributee or permissible distributee of tru st income or principal in 3 12 
different situations.  One situation is whether the charitable organization would be a 13 
distributee or permissible distributee on the date the status is being determined, without 14 
providing additional criteria.  That provision of current law is inconsistent with the 15 
Uniform Trust Code approved by the Uniform Law Commissioners.  The Uniform Trust 16 
Code provides that a charitable organization is a qualified beneficiary if it would be a 17 
distributee or permissible distributee of the tru st if the trust were to terminate on that date.  18 
This bill amends the current law to be consistent with the Uniform Trust Code, making it 19 
clear that the determination is based on whether the charitable organization would be a 20 
distributee or permissible dis tributee if the trust were to terminate on the date that the 21 
beneficiary status determination is being made.  22
