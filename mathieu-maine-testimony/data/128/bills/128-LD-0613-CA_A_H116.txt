128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 429, L.D. 613, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Job Applicants :from Identity Theft" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 26 MRSA §600-A is enacted to read: 
§600-A. Prospective employees' social security numbers 
An employer may not request a social security number from a prospective employee 
on an employment application or during the application process for employment except 
for the purposes of substance abuse testing under subchapter 3-A or a preemployment 
background check. This section does not apply to an employer's request for a social 
security number after the employee has been hired.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development, replaces the bill with language 
to clarify the intent to prohibit the request of a social security number from a prospective 
employee by an employer on an employment application or during the application 
process. An employer may still request a social security number from a prospective 
employee for purposes of a substance abuse test or preemployment background check. 
The amendment further clarifies that an employer is not prohibited from asking for a 
social security number from an individual for any reason after the individual has been 
hired.
