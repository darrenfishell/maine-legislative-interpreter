41 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1118, L.D. 1619 
Prescription Monitoring Program under Title 22, chapter 1603. This enhancement must 
allow a facility that provides methadone for the treatment of opioid dependency to enter 
the name of the methadone treatment facility treating a patient and the dosage 
information for a patient who has given consent. The information may not be accessible 
except to health care professionals during an emergency to the extent necessary to meet a 
bona fide emergency in which the patient's prior info1med consent cannot be obtained. 
Any disclosure in an emergency setting must be entered into the program, including the 
date and time of the disclosure, the nature of the patient's emergency, the name of the 
facility or hospital where the disclosure occurred and the names of the health care 
professionals who accessed the records in the program. The department shall convene 
stakeholders to advise the department on the criteria for the enhancement of the program. 
Stakeholders must include representatives from methadone treatment clinics and 
providers of emergency services. The enhancement of the program must meet the 
requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 7250, subsection 7. The 
department shall, no later than January 30, 2018, provide a report to the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services describing progress on implementing the 
enhancement required pursuant to this section.'
