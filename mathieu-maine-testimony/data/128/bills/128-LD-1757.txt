Page 1 - 128LR2642(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the increases  in the rate of the minimum wage scheduled to take effect  
4 over the  next 4  years could have a detrimental  effect  on the economy  of the State; and
5 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
6 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
7 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
8 therefore,
9 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
10 Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
11 amended to read:
12 1.  Minimum wage.   The minimum  hourly  wage is $7.50  per hour.   Starting January  
13 1, 2017, the minimum  hourly wage  is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018.  Starting 
14 June 1, 2018, the minimum hourly wage is $10.00 $9.50 per hour; starting January 1, 
15 2019, the minimum hourly wage  is $11.00 $10.00 per hour;  and starting January  1, 2020, 
16 the minimum  hourly wage is $12.00 $10.50 per hour.  On ; and starting January 1, 2021 
17 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum hourly wage then in effect  must be 
18 increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living. The increase in the cost of living 
19 must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as of August of the previous  year 
20 over the level  as of August of the year preceding  that year in the Consumer Price  Index  
21 for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI-W,  for the Northeast Region, or its 
22 successor index, as published  by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau  of Labor 
23 Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount  of the minimum wage increase 
24 rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢ , the minimum  hourly  wage  is $11.00.  If the highest  
25 federal minimum wage is increased in excess  of the minimum wage in effect under  this 
26 section, the minimum  wage under this section  is increased to the same amount, effective  
27 on the same date as the increase in the federal  minimum  wage, and must be increased in 
28 accordance with this section thereafter but in no case may the minimum wage exceed the 
29 minimum wage otherwise in effect  under this  section by more  than  $1.00 per  hour .
30 Sec. 2.  26 MRSA  §664, sub-§1-A is enacted  to read:
31 1-A.  Minimum wage  for training and youths.  Notwithstanding  subsection 1, the 
32 following minimum hourly wage may be  paid to the following employees:
33 A.  For the first 90 consecutive days of employment of an employee who is at least 
34 18 years of  age but under 20 years of age, a training  wage that is the greater  of:
35 (1)  Eighty percent of the minimum wage in effect  pursuant to subsection 1, 
36 rounded to  the nearest  5 cents; and
37 (2)  The minimum wage required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act; and
38 B.  For an employee who has not attained  18 years of age, a youth wage  that is the 
39 greater of:
Page 2 - 128LR2642(01)-11 (1)  Eighty percent of the minimum wage in effect  pursuant to subsection 1, 
2 rounded to  the nearest  5 cents; and
3 (2)  The minimum wage required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

5 legislation takes effect when  approved.
