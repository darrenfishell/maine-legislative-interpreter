JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING APRIL 2017  
AS AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH 
 
 WHEREAS,  autism is a spectrum disorder, which means no 2 peo ple with autism are 
affected the same way, and it is a complex developm ental disability that usually appears during 
the first 3 years of life and results in a neurolog ical disorder that affects the functioning of the 
brain and social interaction and communication skil ls; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  in the United States, one in 68 children is diagnos ed with this spectrum 
disorder and prevalence has increased 30% since the  United States Centers for Disease Control 
and Preventionâ€™s study in 2008; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  autism knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries  and neither income nor 
lifestyle nor education affects its occurrence and it is estimated that more than 3,500,000 people 
live with autism spectrum disorder in the United St ates; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  autism costs the United States over $236,000,000,00 0 in annual health care 
costs, most of which are in adult services, and the se costs are anticipated to increase; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  while a single specific cause of autism is not know n, current research links 
it to biological or neurological differences in the  brain, and outdated theories and myths, such as 
autism being a mental illness, have been proven to be false; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  with support, people with autism can live full live s and make meaningful 
contributions to society; now, therefore, be it 
 
 RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature 
now assembled in the First Regular Session, on beha lf of the people we represent, pause in our 
deliberations to acknowledge that the month of Apri l 2017 is Autism Awareness Month and to 
pledge our support and encouragement to all those a ffected by autism; and be it further 
 
 RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution,  duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Autism Society of M aine as a token of our respect and support.
