 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §871, sub -§1-B is enacted to read:  2 
1-B.  Inquiry.   An employer, before employing a person or referring a person for 3 
employment, shall make a good faith inquiry as to whether tha t person is a United States 4 
citizen or an alien, and if the inquiry reasonably indicates that the person is an alien, the 5 
employer shall use the E -Verify program to verify the employment eligibility of that 6 
person.  As used in this section, "E -Verify progr am" means the federal E -Verify program 7 
operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security and other federal 8 
agencies or any successor or equivalent program used to verify a person's employment 9 
eligibility.  10 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §871, sub -§2, as amend ed by PL 2009, c. 637, §2, is further 11 
amended to read:  12 
2.  Penalty.   Violation of subsection 1 or 1 -A is a Class E crime.  It is an affirmative 13 
defense to prosecution under subsection 1 that the employer, before employing a person  14 
or referring a person for  employment, made a good faith inquiry as to whether that person 15 
was a United States citizen or an alien, and if the inquiry reasonably indicated that the 16 
person was an alien, the employer made a further good faith inquiry that reasonably 17 
indicated  used th e E-Verify program to verify  that the alien was lawfully admitted to the 18 
United States for permanent residence or that the United States Immigration and 19 
Naturalization Service had authorized the alien to accept employment in the United 20 
States.  21 
A.  A good f aith inquiry under this subsection must be in writing.  An employment 22 
application form that requests citizenship data, or an alien registration number if the 23 
applicant is an alien, meets the requirement of a good faith inquiry in writing.  24 
B.  A social secu rity account number card is not considered evidence of the United 25 
States Immigration and Naturalization Service's authorization for an alien to accept 26 
employment in the United States.  27 
SUMMARY  28 
This bill requires an employer, before employing a person or ref erring a person for 29 
employment, to make a good faith inquiry as to whether that person is a United States 30 
citizen or an alien, and if the inquiry reasonably indicates that the person is an alien, the 31 
employer must use the E -Verify program operated by the U nited States Department of 32 
Homeland Security to verify the employment eligibility of that person.  33
