10 An applicant  shall submit to the commissioner information demonstrating that the 
11 applicant is a qualified applicant.  If a certified applicant undertakes  to make  an 
12 additional qualified investment, the certified applicant may apply to the 
13 commissioner for an additional certificate of approval.
14 B.  The commissioner, within 30 days of receipt of an application submitted pursuant

17 applicant is not qualified. The certificate  issued by the commissioner must describe 
18 the qualified investment  and specify the total amount of qualified investment 
19 approved under the  certificate.
20 C.  Upon issuance of a certificate of completion in accordance with paragraph  F, the

36 time of the transfer;  or
37 (2)  The commissioner finds  that the transferee will, and has the capacity to, 
38 maintain operations of the headquarters in the State in a manner that meets the 
39 minimum qualifications for continued eligibility  of benefits under this section  
40 after the transfer  occurs. 
41 If the commissioner approves the transfer of the certificate, the transferee, from the 
42 date of the transfer,  must be treated as the certified applicant and as eligible to claim 
43 any remaining benefit under the certificate of approval or the certificate  of 
Page 3 - 128LR2996(01)-11 completion that has not been previously  claimed by the transferor  as long as the 
2 transferee meets  the same eligibility requirements and conditions  for the credit as 
3 applied to the original certified  applicant.
4 E.  The commissioner must  revoke a certificate  of approval if the certified applicant 
5 or a person  to whom a certificate of approval  has been transferred  pursuant to 
6 paragraph D fails to make a qualified  investment within 5 years  of the date of the 
7 certificate of approval.   The commissioner shall  revoke a certificate of approval  or a 
8 certificate of completion if the applicant ceases operations of the headquarters  in the 
9 State or the certificate of approval  or certificate  of completion is transferred to 
10 another person without approval from the commissioner  pursuant to paragraph D.  A 
11 certified applicant whose certificate of completion is revoked within 5 years after the 
12 date issued shall within 60 days following  revocation of the certificate  return to the 
13 State an amount equal to the total credits claimed under this section. A certified 
14 applicant whose certificate of completion is revoked during the period from  6 years 
15 after through  10 years after the date the certificate was issued shall within 60 days 
16 following revocation of the certificate return to the State an amount equal  to the total 
17 credits claimed under this section for the period from 6 years after through 10 years 
18 after the date the certificate was issued.  If credit amounts are recaptured after a 
19 certificate of approval has been transferred as provided  in paragraph  D, the transferee 
20 is responsible  for payment of any credit  amounts  that must  be returned to the State.
21 F.  Upon making the qualified investment  and completing  the headquarters and 
22 employment criteria in subsection 1, paragraph G, a certified applicant shall submit 
23 an application to the commissioner for a certificate of completion.  If the 
24 commissioner determines that a qualified investment has been made, the applicant's 
25 headquarters is located in the State and at least 25% of the applicant's full-time 
26 employees, as measured  at the time of application for the certificate of approval, are 
27 based in the State, the commissioner shall  issue a certificate  of completion  to the 
28 certified applicant as soon  as is practical.  The certificate  of completion must state the 
29 amount of  qualified investment made by the certified applicant.
30 The commissioner may not issue certificates of approval under this subsection  that total,  
31 in the aggregate, more than $100,000,000 of qualified investment or any individual 
32 certificate of approval for more than $40,000,000 of qualified investment.

34 provided in this subsection.
35 A.  Subject  to the limitations under paragraph  B, beginning with the tax year during 
36 which the certificate of completion is issued or the tax year beginning in 2020, 
37 whichever is later,  and for each of the following 19 tax years, a certified applicant is 
38 allowed a credit against the tax due under this Part for the taxable year in an amount  
39 equal to 2% of the certified applicant's qualified  investment amount of actual  
40 qualified investment specified on the certified applicant's certificate of completion  
41 under subsection 2, paragraph  F or the amount of qualified investment  approved by 
42 the commissioner in the certificate of approval under subsection 2, paragraph B,

2 meet or exceed  the following employment targets as measured on the last day of
