 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  33 MRSA §1602 -117, sub -§(d), as enacted by PL 1981, c. 699, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
(d)  Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this 4 
Act, no an amendmen t may not create or increase special declarant rights, increase the 5 
number of units , or change the boundaries of any unit, the allocated interests of a unit , or 6 
the uses to which any unit is restricted, in the absence of unanimous consent of  the 7 
requisite number of  unit owners.  For purposes of this subsection, "requisite number of 8 
unit owners" has the same meaning as in section 1603 -112, subsection (f).  9 
Sec. 2.  33 MRSA §1603 -112, sub -§§(a) and (b), as enacted by PL 1981, c. 699, 10 
are amended to read:  11 
(a)  Portions of the common elements may be conveyed or subjected to a security 12 
interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 80% of the votes in the 13 
association, including 80% of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or 14 
any larger percentage the declaration specifies  a requisite number of unit owners, as 15 
defined in subsection (f) , agree to that action ; provided that all the owners of units to 16 
which any limited common element is allocated must agree in order to convey that 17 
limited common element or subject it to a security interest.  The declaration may specify 18 
a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively 19 
to nonresidential uses .  Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association . 20 
(b)  An agreement to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest 21 
must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same 22 
manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners as defined in subsection  (f). The 23 
agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded 24 
before that date.  The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every 25 
county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and is are effective only upon 26 
recordation.  27 
Sec. 3.  33 MRSA §1603 -112, sub -§(f) is enacted to read:  28 
(f)  As used in this section, "requisite number of unit owners" means:  29 
(1) When there are 9 or fewer units in the association, 100% of the votes allocated to 30 
units in the  association; or  31 
(2) When there are 10 or more units in the association, at least 80% of the votes 32 
allocated to units in the association, rounded up to the next whole number.  33 
SUMMARY  34 
This bill amends the Maine Condominium Act to change the number of votes,  35 
depending on the number of units in the association, needed by owners of units in the 36 
association in order to convey or use as collateral common elements of the condominium 37 
or to amend the declaration of the condominium.  Under this bill, if an associatio n 38

 consists of 9 or fewer units, agreement by all of the owners is necessary; if an association 1 
consists of 10 or more units, agreement by the owners of at least 80% of the votes 2 
allocated to units, rounded up to the next whole number, in the association is  necessary.  3
