 SUMMARY  1 
Part A of this bill authorizes a General Fund bond issue, in the amount of 2 
$10,000,000, to be allocated to the Municipal Gigabit Broadband Network Access Fund 3 
and distributed by the  ConnectME Authority through implementation grants in order to 4 
expand high -speed broadband Internet infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas.  5 
Part B of the bill limits the use of the funds under Part A to implementation grants 6 
awarded from the Muni cipal Gigabit Broadband Network Access Fund and requires the 7 
grants to be expended on open -access nondiscriminatory broadband infrastructure in 8 
unserved or underserved areas.  9 
Part C of the bill amends the laws establishing the Municipal Gigabit Broadband 10 
Network Access Fund to require planning grant applicants to plan for postconstruction 11 
operation and maintenance.  Part C clarifies that a municipality may be eligible for 12 
ConnectME Authority implementation grant funds without relying on planning grant 13 
funds  from the authority if the municipality meets certain statutory planning 14 
requirements.  Part C also clarifies that municipally financed planning expenditures may 15 
be deducted from the 25% cash match requirement of the implementation grant.  The 16 
changes made  in Part C are contingent on the ratification of the bond issue in Part A by 17 
the voters of the State.  18
