COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 55, L.D. 136, Bill, "An Act Regarding 
the Eviction Process" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 3 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 3. 14 MRSA ยง6002, sub-ยง1, 11E and Fare enacted to read: 
E. The tenant or the tenant's guest or invitee is the perpetrator of violence, a threat of 
violence or sexual assault against another tenant, a tenant's guest, the landlord or the 
landlord's employee or agent, except that this paragraph does not apply to a tenant 
who is a victim as defined in section 6000, subsection 4 and who has taken 
reasonable action under the circumstances to comply with the landlord's request for 
protection of the tenant, another tenant, a tenant's guest or invitee, the landlord or the 
landlord's employee or agent or of the landlord's property; or 
F. The person occupying the premises is not an authorized occupant of the premises.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or 
stalking who has taken reasonable actions to comply with a landlord's request for the 
protection of tenants, guests or invitees or the landlord from violence or the threat of 
violence or sexual assault is not subject to eviction with a 7-day notice of termination. 
The amendment also removes the provision of the bill permitting 7-day notice of 
termination of tenancy if a tenant provides false information on the tenant's rental 
application.
