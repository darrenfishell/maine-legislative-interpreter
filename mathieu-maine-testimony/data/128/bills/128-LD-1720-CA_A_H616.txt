2 allowance. 
3 A temporary med.ioal allowance may not 6*:ceed one year. A request for a temporary 
4 medical allowance must be in writing and must specify the dates for which the temporary 
5 medical allowance is requested. The holder of the Class I, Class II or Class III lobster 
6 and crab fishing license on which the temporary medical allowance is based must 
7 maintain a valid license during the duration of the temporary medical allowance. The 
8 holder of the Class I, Class II or Class III lobster and crab fishing license is liable for the

10 Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §6450, sub-§§2 and 3 are enacted to read: 
11 2. Term. A temporary medical allowance may not exceed one year or, upon renewal 
12 under subsection 3, a total of 2 consecutive years. 
13 3. Renewal. The commissioner may renew a temporary medical allowance issued 
14 under subsection 1 for a maximum of one year upon a request in writing from the holder 
15 of the Class I, Class II or Class III lobster and crab fishing license upon which the

17 by the commissioner before the expiration of a current temporary medical allowance 
18 issued to that license holder.' 
19 SUMMARY 
20 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment removes the provision of the bill 
21 that extends the maximum duration of a temporary medical allowance for lobster and 
22 crab fishing license holders from one year to 2 years and instead provides that the 
23 Commissioner of Marine Resources may renew an existing temporary medical allowance 
24 for up to one year upon application of the holder of the license upon which the allowance 
25 is based. As with current law, the amendment provides that a temporary medical 
26 allowance may not exceed one year, but the amendment provides that, upon renewal, the 
27 temporary medical allowance may not exceed a total of 2 consecutive years. 
28 The amendment removes the provisions of the bill that create a temporary terminal 
29 illness medical allowance for lobster and crab fishing license holders diagnosed with a 
30 terminal illness.
