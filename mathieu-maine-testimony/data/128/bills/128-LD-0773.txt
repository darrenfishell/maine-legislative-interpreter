 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  18-A MRSA Art. 6, Pt. 4 is enacted to read:   2 
UNIFORM REAL  PROPERTY TRANSFER ON DEATH ACT (2009)  3 
Prefatory Note  4 
One of the main innovations in the property law of the twentieth century h as been the 5 
development of asset -specific will substitutes for the transfer of property at death. By 6 
these mechanisms, an owner may designate beneficiaries to receive the property at the 7 
owner's death without waiting for probate and without the beneficiary  designation 8 
needing to comply with the witnessing requirements of wills. Examples of specific assets 9 
that today routinely pass outside of probate include the proceeds of life insurance policies 10 
and pension plans, securities registered in transfer on death  (TOD) form, and funds held 11 
in pay on death (POD) bank accounts.  12 
Today, nonprobate transfers are widely accepted. The trend has largely focused on 13 
assets that are personal property, such as the assets described in the preceding paragraph. 14 
However, long -standing uniform law speaks more broadly. Section 6 -101 of the Uniform 15 
Probate Code (UPC) provides:  " A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in  an 16 
insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated 17 
or uncertificate d security, account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, 18 
compensation plan, pension plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, 19 
conveyance, deed of gift , marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a 20 
similar  nature is nontestamentary " (emphasis supplied).  21 
A small but growing number of jurisdictions have implemented the principle of UPC 22 
Section 6 -101 by enacting statutes providing an asset -specific mechanism for the 23 
nonprobate transfer of land. This is done by  permitting owners of interests in real 24 
property to execute and record a transfer on death (TOD) deed. By this deed, the owner 25 
identifies the beneficiary or beneficiaries who will succeed to the property at the owner's 26 
death. During the owner's lifetime, t he beneficiaries have no interest in the property, and 27 
the owner retains full power to transfer or encumber the property or to revoke the TOD 28 
deed.  29 
Thirteen states have enacted statutes authorizing TOD deeds. In the chronological 30 
order of the statutes' ena ctment, the states are: Missouri (1989), Kansas (1997), Ohio 31 
(2000), New Mexico (2001), Arizona (2002), Nevada (2003), Colorado (2004), Arkansas 32 
(2005), Wisconsin (2006), Montana (2007), Oklahoma (2008), Minnesota (2008), and 33 
Indiana (2009).  34 
The time is ri pe for a Uniform Act to facilitate this emerging form of nonprobate 35 
transfer and to bring uniformity and clarity to its use and operation.  36 
PART 4  37 
UNIFORM REAL PROPERT Y TRANSFER ON DEATH ACT  38 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 §6-401.  Short title  1 
This Part may be known and cited as "the Unif orm Real Property Transfer on Death 2 
Act."  3 
§6-402.  Definitions  4 
As used in this Part, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms have 5 
the following meanings.  6 
1.  Beneficiary.   "Beneficiary" means a person that receives property under a tran sfer 7 
on death deed.  8 
2.  Designated beneficiary.   "Designated beneficiary" means a person designated to 9 
receive property in a transfer on death deed.  10 
3.  Joint owner.   "Joint owner" means an individual who owns property concurrently 11 
with one or more other i ndividuals with a right of survivorship.  "Joint owner" includes a 12 
joint tenant and tenant by the entirety.  "Joint owner" does not include a tenant in 13 
common or owner of community property without a right of survivorship.  14 
4.  Person.   "Person" means an in dividual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, 15 
partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, 16 
government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality or any other legal or 17 
commercial entity.  18 
5.  Property.   "Property" means an interest in real property located in this State that 19 
is transferable on the death of the owner.  20 
6.  Transfer on death deed.   "Transfer on death deed" means a deed authorized 21 
under this Part.  22 
7.  Transferor.   "Transferor" means a n individual who makes a transfer on death 23 
deed.  24 
Comment  25 
Paragraph (1) defines a beneficiary as a person that receives property under a transfer 26 
on death deed.  This links the definition of a "beneficiary" to the definition of a "person." 27 
A beneficiary can  be any person, including the trustee of a revocable trust.  28 
Paragraph (2) defines a designated beneficiary as a person designated to receive 29 
property in a transfer on death deed. This links the definition of a "designated 30 
beneficiary" to the definition of a "person." A designated beneficiary can be any person, 31 
including a revocable trust.  32 
The distinction between a "beneficiary" and a "designated beneficiary" is easily 33 
illustrated. Section 13 provides that, on the transferor's death, the property that is the  34 
subject of a transfer on death deed is transferred to the designated beneficiaries who 35 
survive the transferor. If X and Y are the designated beneficiaries but only Y survives the 36 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 transferor, then Y is a beneficiary and X is not. A further illustration com es into play if 1 
Section 13 is made subject to the state's antilapse statute. If X fails to survive the 2 
transferor but has a descendant, Z, who survives the transferor, the antilapse statute may 3 
create a substitute gift in favor of Z. In such a case, the de signated beneficiaries are X and 4 
Y, but the beneficiaries are Y and Z. 5 
Paragraph (3) provides a definition of a "joint owner" as an individual who owns 6 
property with one or more other individuals with a right of survivorship. The term is used 7 
in Sections 1 1 and 13.  8 
Paragraph (4) is the standard Uniform Law Commission definition of a "person."  9 
The effect of paragraph (5) is that the act applies to all interests in real property 10 
located in this state that are transferable at the death of the owner.  11 
Paragraph (6) provides that a "transfer on death deed" is a deed authorized under this 12 
act. In some states with existing transfer on death deed legislation, the legislation has 13 
instead used the term "beneficiary deed." The term "transfer on death deed" is preferred,  14 
to be consistent with the transfer on death registration of securities. See Article 6, Part 3, 15 
of the Uniform Probate Code, containing the Uniform TOD Security Registration Act.  16 
Paragraph (7) limits the definition of a "transferor" to an individual. The t erm 17 
"transferor" does not include a corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, 18 
limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, government or 19 
governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, or any legal or comm ercial entity 20 
other than an individual. The term also does not include an agent or other representative. 21 
If a transfer on death deed is made by an agent on behalf of a principal or by a 22 
conservator, guardian, or judge on behalf of a ward, the principal or ward is the 23 
transferor. By way of analogy, see Uniform Trust Code (2000/2005) Section 103(15) 24 
(defining "settlor") and the accompanying Comment (excluding an individual "acting as 25 
the agent for the person who will be funding the trust"). The power of an ag ent to make or 26 
revoke a transfer on death deed on behalf of a principal is determined by other law, such 27 
as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) (UPC Article 5B), as indicated in the 28 
Comments to Sections 9 and 11 (UPC Sections 6 -409 and 6 -411).  29 
§6-403.  Applicability  30 
This Part applies to a transfer on death deed made before, on or after January 1, 2018 31 
by a transferor dying on or after January 1, 2018.  32 
Comment  33 
This section provides that the act applies to a transfer on death deed made before, on, 34 
or aft er the effective date of the act by a transferor dying on or after the effective date of 35 
the act. This section is consistent with the Uniform Probate Code's provisions governing 36 
transfer on death registration of securities. Those provisions "appl[y] to reg istrations of 37 
securities in beneficiary form made before or after [effective date], by decedents dying on 38 
or after [effective date]." UPC Section 6 -311. 39 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 §6-404.  Nonexclusivity  1 
This Part does not affect any method of transferring property otherwise permitt ed 2 
under the law of this State.  3 
Comment  4 
This section provides that the act is nonexclusive. The act does not affect any method 5 
of transferring property otherwise permitted under state law.  6 
One such method is a present transfer with a retained legal life es tate. Consider the 7 
following examples:  8 
Example 1 . A conveys Blackacre to B while reserving A's right to remain in 9 
possession until A's death. By this conveyance, A has made a present transfer of a future 10 
interest to B. The transfer is irrevocable. The futu re interest will ripen into possession at 11 
A's death, even if B fails to survive A. 12 
Example 2 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 13 
Blackacre, naming B as the designated beneficiary. During A's lifetime, no interest passes 14 
to B, and A may revoke the deed. If unrevoked, the deed will transfer possession to B at 15 
A's death only if B survives A. 16 
As illustrated in these examples, the two methods of transfer have different effects 17 
and are governed by different rules.  18 
§6-405.  Transfer  on death deed authorized  19 
An individual may transfer property to one or more beneficiaries effective at the 20 
transferor's death by a transfer on death deed.  21 
Comment  22 
This section authorizes a transfer on death deed and makes it clear that the transfer is 23 
not an inter vivos transfer. The transfer occurs at the transferor's death.  24 
The transferor is an individual, but the singular includes the plural. Multiple 25 
individuals can readily act together to transfer property by a transfer on death deed, as in 26 
the common  case of a husband and wife who own the property as joint tenants or as 27 
tenants by the entirety. On the effect of a transfer on death deed made by joint owners, 28 
see Section 13(c) and the accompanying Comment.  29 
The transferor may select any form of ownership , concurrent or successive, absolute 30 
or conditional, contingent or vested, valid under state law. Among many other things, this 31 
permits the transferor to reserve interests for the transferor' s estate (e.g., mineral 32 
interests); to specify the nature and ext ent of the beneficiary's interest; and to designate 33 
one or more primary beneficiaries and one or more alternate beneficiaries to take in the 34 
event the primary beneficiaries fail to survive the transferor. This freedom to specify the 35 
form and terms of the t ransferee's interest comports with the fundamental principle of 36 
American law recognized by the Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other 37 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 Donative Transfers) §10.1 that the donor's intention should be "given effect to the 1 
maximum extent allowed by la w." As the Restatement explains in Comment c to §10.1, 2 
"American law curtails freedom of disposition only to the extent that the donor attempts 3 
to make a disposition or achieve a purpose that is prohibited or restricted by an overriding 4 
rule of law."  5 
Notwi thstanding this freedom of disposition, transferors are encouraged as a practical 6 
matter to avoid formulating dispositions that would complicate title. Dispositions 7 
containing conditions or class gifts, for example, may require a court proceeding to sort 8 
out the beneficiaries' interests. Other estate planning mechanisms, such as trusts, may be 9 
more appropriate in such cases.  10 
§6-406.  Transfer on death deed revocable  11 
A transfer on death deed is revocable even if the deed or another instrument contains 12 
a cont rary provision.  13 
Comment  14 
A fundamental feature of a transfer on death deed under this act is that the transferor 15 
retains the power to revoke the deed. Section 6 is framed as a mandatory rule, for two 16 
reasons. First, the rule prevents an off -record instrumen t from affecting the revocability 17 
of a transfer on death deed. Second, the rule protects the transferor who may wish later to 18 
revoke the deed.  19 
If the transferor promises to make the deed irrevocable or not to revoke the deed, the 20 
promisee may have a remedy  under other law if the promise is broken. The deed remains 21 
revocable despite the promise.  22 
§6-407.  Transfer on death deed nontestamentary  23 
A transfer on death deed is nontestamentary.  24 
Comment  25 
This section is consistent with Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -101(a), which 26 
provides: "A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in an insurance policy, contract 27 
of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, 28 
account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, comp ensation plan, pension 29 
plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift, 30 
marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a similar nature is 31 
nontestamentary."  32 
As the Comment to Uniform Probate Code Section  6-101 explains, because the mode 33 
of transfer is declared to be nontestamentary, the instrument of transfer is not a will and 34 
does not have to be executed in compliance with the formalities for wills, nor does the 35 
instrument need to be probated.  36 
Whether a document that is ineffective as a transfer on death deed (e.g., because it 37 
has not been recorded before the transferor's death) should be given effect as a 38 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 testamentary instrument will depend on the applicable facts and on the wills law of the 1 
jurisdiction . Section 2 -503 of the Uniform Probate Code provides in pertinent part: 2 
"Although a document ... was not executed in compliance with Section 2 -502, the 3 
document ... is treated as if it had been executed in compliance with that section if the 4 
proponent of t he document ... establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the 5 
decedent intended the document ... to constitute ... (iii) an addition to or alteration of the 6 
[decedent's] will ...."  7 
§6-408.  Capacity of transferor  8 
The capacity required to make or re voke a transfer on death deed is the same as the 9 
capacity required to make a will.  10 
Comment  11 
This section provides that the capacity required to make or revoke a transfer on death 12 
deed, which is a revocable will substitute, is the same as the capacity requir ed to make a 13 
will. It is appropriate that a will and a transfer on death deed require the same level of 14 
capacity, for both mechanisms are revocable and ambulatory, the latter term meaning that 15 
they do not operate before the grantor's death. This approach i s consistent with the 16 
Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) §8.1(b), which 17 
applies the standard of testamentary capacity, and not the standard of capacity for inter 18 
vivos gifts, to revocable will substitutes: "If the donative  transfer is in the form of a will, 19 
a revocable will substitute, or a revocable gift, the testator or donor must be capable of 20 
knowing and understanding in a general way the nature and extent of his or her property, 21 
the natural objects of his or her bounty , and the disposition that he or she is making of 22 
that property, and must also be capable of relating these elements to one another and 23 
forming an orderly desire regarding the disposition of the property." This section is also 24 
consistent with Uniform Trust  Code Section 601: "The capacity required to create, 25 
amend, revoke, or add property to a revocable trust, or to direct the actions of the trustee 26 
of a revocable trust, is the same as that required to make a will."  27 
A transfer on death deed is not affected i f the transferor subsequently loses capacity. 28 
On the ability of an agent under a power of attorney to make or revoke a transfer on death 29 
deed, see the Comments to Sections 9 and 11.  30 
§6-409.  Requirements  31 
A transfer on death deed:  32 
1.  Essential elements and  formalities.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 33 
2, must contain the essential elements and formalities of a properly recordable inter vivos 34 
deed;  35 
2.  Death of transferor.  Must state that the transfer to the designated beneficiary is 36 
to occur at the transferor's death; and  37 
3.  Recorded before transferor's death.  Must be recorded before the transferor's 38 
death in the public records in the registry of deeds in the county where the property is 39 
located.  40 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 Comment  1 
Paragraph (1) requires a transfer on dea th deed to contain the same essential elements 2 
and formalities, other than a present intention to convey, as are required for a properly 3 
recordable inter vivos deed under state law. "Essential elements" is a term with a long 4 
usage in the law of deeds of re al property. The essential elements of a deed vary from one 5 
state to another but commonly include the names of the grantor and grantee, a clause 6 
transferring title, a description of the property transferred, and the grantor's signature. In 7 
all states, the essential elements of a properly recordable deed include the requirement 8 
that the deed be acknowledged by the grantor before a notary public or other individual 9 
authorized by law to take acknowledgments. See Thompson on Real Property §92.04(c) 10 
(observing t hat a "certificate of acknowledgment or attestation is universally required to 11 
qualify an instrument for recordation"). In the context of transfer on death deeds, the 12 
requirement of acknowledgment fulfills at least four functions. First, it cautions a 13 
transferor that he or she is performing an act with legal consequences. Such caution is 14 
important where, as here, the transferor does not experience the wrench of delivery 15 
because the transfer occurs at death. Second, acknowledgment helps to prevent fraud. 16 
Third, acknowledgment facilitates the recording of the deed. Fourth, acknowledgment 17 
enables the rule in Section 11 that a later acknowledged deed prevails over an earlier 18 
acknowledged deed.  19 
Paragraph (2) emphasizes an important distinction between an inter vi vos transfer and 20 
a transfer on death. An inter vivos transfer reflects an intention to transfer, at the time of 21 
the conveyance, an interest in property, either a present interest or a future interest. In 22 
contrast, a transfer on death reflects an intention that the transfer occur at the transferor's 23 
death. Under no circumstances should a transfer on death be given effect inter vivos; to 24 
do so would violate the transferor's intention that the transfer occur at the transferor's 25 
death.  26 
Paragraph (3) requires a transfer on death deed to be recorded before the transferor's 27 
death in the county (or other appropriate administrative division of a state, such as a 28 
parish) where the land is located. If the property described in the deed is in more than one 29 
county, the d eed is effective only with respect to the property in the county or counties 30 
where the deed is recorded. The requirement of recordation before death helps to prevent 31 
fraud by ensuring that all steps necessary to the effective transfer on death deed are 32 
completed during the transferor's lifetime.  The requirement of recordation before death 33 
also enables all parties to rely on the recording system.  34 
An individual's agent may execute a transfer on death deed on the individual's behalf 35 
to the extent permitted by  other law, such as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006). 36 
This act does not define, but instead relies on other law to determine, the authority of an 37 
agent.  38 
§6-410.  Notice, delivery, acceptance, consideration not required  39 
A transfer on death deed is e ffective without:  40 
1.  Notice, delivery or acceptance.  Notice or delivery to or acceptance by the 41 
designated beneficiary during the transferor's life; or  42 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 2.  Consideration.  Consideration.  1 
Comment  2 
This section makes it clear that a transfer on death deed i s effective without notice or 3 
delivery to or acceptance by the beneficiary during the transferor's lifetime (paragraph 4 
(1)) and without consideration (paragraph (2)).  5 
Paragraph (1) is consistent with the fundamental distinction under this act between a 6 
transfer on death deed and an inter vivos deed. Under the former, but not under the latter, 7 
the transfer occurs at the transferor's death. Therefore, there is no requirement of notice, 8 
delivery, or acceptance during the transferor's life. This does not mean t hat the 9 
beneficiary is required to accept the property. The beneficiary may disclaim the property, 10 
as explained in Section 14 and the accompanying Comment.  11 
Paragraph (2) is consistent with the law of donative transfers. A deed need not be 12 
supported by cons ideration.  13 
§6-411.  Revocation by instrument authorized; revocation by act not permitted  14 
1.  Revocation by instrument.  Subject to subsection 2, an instrument is effective to 15 
revoke a recorded transfer on death deed, or any part of it, only if the instrume nt: 16 
A.  Is one of the following:  17 
(1)  A transfer on death deed that revokes the deed or part of the deed expressly 18 
or by inconsistency;  19 
(2)  An instrument of revocation that expressly revokes the deed or part of the 20 
deed; or  21 
(3)  An inter vivos deed that e xpressly revokes the transfer on death deed or part 22 
of the deed; and  23 
B.  Is acknowledged by the transferor after the acknowledgment of the deed being 24 
revoked and recorded before the transferor's death in the registry of deeds in the 25 
county where the deed i s recorded.  26 
2.  More than one transferor.  If a transfer on death deed is made by more than one 27 
transferor:  28 
A.  Revocation by a transferor does not affect the deed as to the interest of another 29 
transferor; and  30 
B.  A deed of joint owners is revoked only if it is revoked by all of the living joint 31 
owners.  32 
3.  Revocation after recorded.  After a transfer on death deed is recorded, it may not 33 
be revoked by a revocatory act on the deed.  34 
4.  Inter vivos transfer.  This section does not limit the effect of an inte r vivos 35 
transfer of the property.  36 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 Comment  1 
This section concerns revocation by instrument and revocation by act. On revocation 2 
by change of circumstances, such as by divorce or homicide, see Section 13 and the 3 
accompanying Comment.  4 
Subsection (a) provides t he exclusive methods of revoking, in whole or in part, a 5 
recorded transfer on death deed by a subsequent instrument. Revocation by an instrument 6 
not specified, such as the transferor's will, is not permitted.  7 
The rule that a transfer on death deed may not be revoked by the transferor's 8 
subsequent will is a departure from the Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other 9 
Donative Transfers) §7.2 comment e (see also the corresponding Reporter's Note), which 10 
encourages the revocability of will substitutes b y will. However, there is a sound reason 11 
for the departure in the specific case of a transfer on death deed. A transfer on death deed 12 
operates on real property, for which certainty of title is essential. This certainty would be 13 
difficult, and in many cases  impossible, to achieve if an off -record instrument, such as the 14 
grantor's will, could revoke a recorded transfer on death deed. The rule in this act against 15 
revocation by will is also consistent with the uniform acts governing multiple -party bank 16 
accounts . See Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -213(b) ("A right of survivorship arising 17 
from the express terms of the account, Section 6 -212, or a POD designation, may not be 18 
altered by will.")  19 
A recorded transfer on death deed may be revoked by instrument only by ( 1) a 20 
subsequently acknowledged transfer on death deed, (2) a subsequently acknowledged 21 
instrument of revocation, such as the form in Section 17, or (3) a subsequently 22 
acknowledged inter vivos deed containing an express revocation clause. Consider the 23 
follo wing examples:  24 
Example 1 . T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 25 
Blackacre. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and records a second transfer on death deed 26 
for Blackacre, containing an express revocation clause revoking "all my pri or transfer on 27 
death deeds concerning this property." The second deed revokes the first deed. The 28 
revocation occurs when the second deed is recorded. (For the result if the second deed 29 
had not contained the express revocation clause, see Example 5.)  30 
Exampl e 2. T executes, acknowledges, and records two transfer on death deeds for 31 
Blackacre. Both deeds expressly revoke "all my prior transfer on death deeds concerning 32 
this property." The dates of acknowledgment determine which deed revoked the other. 33 
The first  deed is acknowledged November 1; the second deed is acknowledged December 34 
15. The second deed is the later acknowledged, so it revokes the first deed. The 35 
revocation occurs when the second deed is recorded.  36 
Example 3 . T executes and acknowledges a transfe r on death deed for Blackacre. T 37 
later executes and acknowledges a revocation form. Both instruments are recorded. 38 
Because the revocation form is acknowledged later than the deed, the form revokes the 39 
deed. The revocation occurs when the form is recorded.  40 
 
 Page 10 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 Example 4 . T executes and acknowledges a transfer on death deed for Blackacre. T 1 
later executes and acknowledges an inter vivos deed conveying Blackacre and expressly 2 
revoking the transfer on death deed. Both instruments are recorded. Because the inter 3 
vivos deed contains an express revocation provision and is acknowledged later than the 4 
transfer on death deed, the inter vivos deed revokes the transfer on death deed. The 5 
revocation occurs when the inter vivos deed is recorded. (For the result if the inter v ivos 6 
deed had not contained an express revocation clause, see the discussion below on 7 
"ademption by extinction.")  8 
The same rules apply whether the revocation is total or partial. In the previous 9 
examples, suppose instead that the initial transfer on death deed provides for the transfer 10 
of two parcels, Blackacre and Whiteacre, and that the subsequent instrument revokes the 11 
transfer on death deed as to Blackacre. The subsequent instrument revokes the transfer on 12 
death deed in part.  13 
If the property described i n the original deed is in more than one county, the 14 
revocation is effective only with respect to the property in the county or counties where 15 
the revoking deed or instrument is recorded.  16 
Subsection (a)(1)(A) speaks of revocation "expressly or by inconsiste ncy." This 17 
provision references the well -established law of revocation by inconsistency of wills. 18 
Consider the following examples:  19 
Example 5 . T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 20 
Blackacre naming X as the designated beneficiar y. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and 21 
records a transfer on death deed for the same property, Blackacre, containing no express 22 
revocation of the earlier deed but naming Y as the designated beneficiary. Later, T dies. 23 
The recording of the deed in favor of  Y revokes the deed in favor of X by inconsistency. 24 
At T's death, Y is the owner of Blackacre.  25 
Example 6 . T, the owner of Blackacre in fee simple absolute, executes, 26 
acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for Blackacre naming X as the 27 
designate d beneficiary. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death 28 
deed containing no express revocation of the earlier deed but naming Y as the designated 29 
beneficiary of a life estate (or a mineral interest) in Blackacre. Later, T dies. The 30 
recording of the deed in favor of Y partially revokes the deed in favor of X by 31 
inconsistency. At T's death, Y is the owner of a life estate (or a mineral interest) in 32 
Blackacre, and X is the owner of the remainder.  33 
The question is sometimes raised whether a recorded inter vivos deed without an 34 
express revocation clause  operates as a revocation of an earlier transfer on death deed. 35 
The answer highlights the important distinction between "revocation" and "ademption by 36 
extinction." See Atkinson on Wills §134. Revocation means that the instrument is 37 
rendered void. Ademption by extinction means that the transfer of the property cannot 38 
occur because the property is not owned by the transferor at death. The doctrines are 39 
different.  40 
In some instances, revocation and  ademption have the same practical effect: the 41 
designated beneficiary of the property receives nothing. Nothing in this section changes 42 
 
 Page 11 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 that fact, as indicated in subsection (d). However, there are other instances where the 1 
doctrines have differing effects . Consider the following illustration, drawn from the law 2 
of wills.  3 
Example 7 . T executes a will devising Blackacre to A. Later, T becomes legally 4 
incompetent, and G is appointed as T's conservator. G, acting within the scope of his 5 
authority, sells Blacka cre to B for $100,000. Later, T dies. 6 
The law of wills provides that the devise to A is adeemed rather than revoked. This 7 
means that A is not entitled to Blackacre but is entitled to a pecuniary devise in the 8 
amount of $100,000. See UPC Section 2 -606(b); A tkinson on Wills §134; Wasserman v. 9 
Cohen , 606 N.E.2d 901, 903 (Mass. 1993). The result is designed to effectuate T's 10 
presumed intention.  11 
The Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts has begun a 12 
conversation on whether the Uniform Probate Co de's provisions on ademption should be 13 
extended to nonprobate transfers, thus harmonizing the treatment of wills and will 14 
substitutes on this aspect of the law.  15 
This act accepts the well -recognized distinction between revocation and ademption in 16 
order to l eave the door open for such future harmonization, which would effectuate the 17 
presumed intention of nonprobate grantors.  18 
Subsection (b) supplies rules governing revocation by instrument in the event of a 19 
transfer on death deed made by multiple owners. Subse ction (b)(1) provides that 20 
revocation by a transferor does not affect a transfer on death deed as to the interest of 21 
another transferor.  22 
Subsection (b)(2) provides that a transfer on death deed of joint owners is revoked 23 
only if it is revoked by all of the  living joint owners. This rule is consistent with Uniform 24 
Probate Code Section 6 -306, which provides in pertinent part: "A registration of a 25 
security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or 26 
all then surviving owners  without the consent of the beneficiary." Subsection (b)(2) 27 
applies only to a deed of joint owners. A joint tenant who severs the joint tenancy, 28 
thereby destroying the right of survivorship, is no longer a joint owner.  29 
Subsection (c) provides that a record ed transfer on death deed may not be revoked by 30 
a revocatory act performed on the deed. Such an act includes burning, tearing, canceling, 31 
obliterating, or destroying the deed or any part of it.  32 
This act does not define, but instead looks to other law to de termine, the authority of 33 
an agent. An individual's agent may revoke a transfer on death deed on the individual's 34 
behalf to the extent permitted by other law, such as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act 35 
(2006).  36 
§6-412.  Effect of transfer on death deed durin g transferor's life  37 
During a transferor's life, a transfer on death deed does not:  38 
 
 Page 12 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 1.  Affect interest or right of transferor or other owner.  Affect an interest or right 1 
of the transferor or any other owner, including the right to transfer or encumber the  2 
property;  3 
2.  Affect interest or right of transferee.  Affect an interest or right of a transferee, 4 
even if the transferee has actual or constructive notice of the deed;  5 
3.  Affect interest or right of creditor.  Affect an interest or right of a secured o r 6 
unsecured creditor or future creditor of the transferor, even if the creditor has actual or 7 
constructive notice of the deed;  8 
4.  Affect eligibility or public assistance.  Affect the transferor's or designated 9 
beneficiary's eligibility for any form of pub lic assistance;  10 
5.  Create legal or equitable interest.  Create a legal or equitable interest in favor of 11 
the designated beneficiary; or  12 
6.  Subject the property to claims or process.  Subject the property to claims or 13 
process of a creditor of the designat ed beneficiary.  14 
Comment  15 
A fundamental feature of a transfer on death deed under this act is that it does not 16 
operate until the transferor's death. The transfer occurs at the transferor's death, not 17 
before.  18 
Paragraph (1): A transfer on death deed, during th e transferor's lifetime, does not 19 
affect the interests or property rights of the transferor or any other owners. Therefore, the 20 
deed does not, among many other things: affect the transferor's right to transfer or 21 
encumber the property inter vivos; sever a joint tenancy or a joint tenant's right of 22 
survivorship; trigger a due -on-sale clause in the transferor's mortgage; trigger the 23 
imposition of real estate transfer tax; or affect the transferor's homestead or real estate tax 24 
exemptions, if any.  25 
Paragraph (2 ): A transfer on death deed does not affect transferees, whether or not 26 
they have notice of the deed. Like a will, the transfer on death deed is ambulatory. It has 27 
no effect on inter vivos transfers.  28 
Paragraph (3): A transfer on death deed, during the tran sferor's lifetime, does not 29 
affect pre -existing or future creditors, secured or unsecured, whether or not they have an 30 
interest in the property or notice of the deed.  31 
Paragraph (4): A transfer on death deed, during the transferor's lifetime, does not 32 
affec t the transferor's or designated beneficiary's eligibility for any form of public 33 
assistance, including Medicaid. On this point, the drafting committee specifically 34 
disapproves of the contrary approach of Colo. Rev. Stat. §15 -15-403. 35 
Paragraph (5): During the transferor's lifetime, a transfer on death deed does not 36 
create a legal or equitable interest in the designated beneficiary. The beneficiary does not 37 
have an interest that can be assigned or encumbered. Note, however, that this rule would 38 
 
 Page 13 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 not preclude the doctrine of after -acquired title. A warranty deed from a designated 1 
beneficiary to a third party would operate to pass the beneficiary's title to the third party 2 
after the transferor's death.  3 
Paragraph (6): A transfer on death deed, during the transfer or's lifetime, does not 4 
make the property subject to claims or process of the designated beneficiary's creditors. 5 
The deed has no more effect than a will.  6 
If a transferor combines an inter vivos transfer of an interest in property (such as a 7 
mineral intere st) with a transfer on death of the remainder interest, the inter vivos transfer 8 
may have present effect even though the transfer on death does not occur until the 9 
transferor's death.  10 
§6-413.  Effect of transfer on death deed at transferor's death  11 
1.  Upon  death of transferor.  Except as otherwise provided in the transfer on death 12 
deed, in this section or in section 2 -508, 2 -605, 2 -803 or 2 -805 or in Article 2, Part 2, on 13 
the death of the transferor, the following rules apply to property that is the subject  of a 14 
transfer on death deed and owned by the transferor at death.  15 
A.  Subject to paragraph B, the interest in the property is transferred to the designated 16 
beneficiary in accordance with the deed.  17 
B.  The interest of a designated beneficiary is contingent  on the designated 18 
beneficiary surviving the transferor.  The interest of a designated beneficiary that fails 19 
to survive the transferor lapses.  20 
C.  Subject to paragraph D, concurrent interests are transferred to the beneficiaries in 21 
equal and undivided sha res with no right of survivorship.  22 
D.  If the transferor has identified 2 or more designated beneficiaries to receive 23 
concurrent interests in the property, the share of one that lapses or fails for any reason 24 
is transferred to the other or to the others in  proportion to the interest of each in the 25 
remaining part of the property held concurrently.  26 
2.  Subject to all interests.  Subject to Title 33, section 201, a beneficiary takes the 27 
property subject to all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments, contracts,  mortgages, 28 
liens and other interests to which the property is subject at the transferor's death.  For 29 
purposes of this subsection and Title 33, section 201, the recording of the transfer on 30 
death deed is deemed to have occurred at the transferor's death.  31 
3.  Joint owner.  If a transferor is a joint owner and is:  32 
A.  Survived by one or more other joint owners, the property that is the subject of a 33 
transfer on death deed belongs to the surviving joint owner or owners with right of 34 
survivorship; or  35 
B.  The la st surviving joint owner, the transfer on death deed is effective.  36 
4.  No covenant or warranty of title.  A transfer on death deed transfers property 37 
without covenant or warranty of title even if the deed contains a contrary provision.  38

 Comment  1 
Subsection ( a) states four default rules, except as otherwise provided by the transfer 2 
on death deed, by this section, or by other provisions of state law governing nonprobate 3 
transfers. On this last, and the desirability of extending the probate rules governing 4 
antilapse, revocation on divorce or homicide, survival and simultaneous death, and the 5 
elective share of the surviving spouse to nonprobate instruments such as transfer on death 6 
deeds, see the Legislative Note.  7 
The four default rules established by subsection ( a) are these. First, the property that 8 
is the subject of an effective transfer on death deed and owned by the transferor at death 9 
is transferred at the transferor's death to the designated beneficiaries as provided in the 10 
deed. The rule implements the tran sferor's intention as described in the deed. Consider the 11 
following example:  12 
Example 1 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 13 
Blackacre naming X as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate beneficiary if X fails 14 
to surviv e A. Both X and Y survive A. Blackacre is transferred to X at A's death in 15 
accordance with the provisions of the deed.  16 
This default rule implements the fundamental principle that the provisions of the deed 17 
control the disposition of the property, unless ot herwise provided by state law.  18 
The drafting committee approves of the result in In re Estate of Roloff , 143 P.3d 406 19 
(Kan. Ct. App. 2006) (holding that crops should be transferred with the land under a 20 
transfer on death deed because this result would be re ached on the same facts with any 21 
other deed).  22 
The bracketed language at the beginning of subsection (a) enables a state to make the 23 
default rules subject to other statutes, such as an antilapse statute or a statute providing 24 
for revocation on divorce. Cons ider the following examples:  25 
Example 2 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 26 
Blackacre naming X as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate beneficiary if X fails 27 
to survive A. In fact, X and Y fail to survive A, who is survived only by X's child, Z. 28 
Assume that the state's antilapse statute applies to transfer on death deeds and creates a 29 
substitute gift in Z. (For such a statute, see Uniform Probate Code Section 2 -706.) 30 
Blackacre is transferred to Z at A's death in acco rdance with the provisions of the deed as 31 
modified by the antilapse statute.  32 
Example 3 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 33 
Blackacre naming her spouse, X, as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate 34 
beneficiary if X fails to survive A. Later, A and X divorce. Assume that the state's statute 35 
on revocation by divorce applies to transfer on death deeds and revokes the designation in 36 
favor of X, with the effect that the provisions of the transfer on death deed are given 37 
effect as if X had disclaimed. (For such a statute, see Uniform Probate Code Section 38 
2-804.) Assume further that the effect of the putative disclaimer is that X is treated as 39 
having failed to survive A. (See the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act 40 
(1999/2006) Section 6(a)(3)(B) (UPC Section 2 -1106(a)(3)(B).) Blackacre is transferred 41 
 
 Page 15 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 to Y at A's death in accordance with the provisions of the deed as modified by the 1 
revocation on divorce and disclaimer statutes.  2 
Note that the property must be owned by t he transferor at death. Property no longer 3 
owned by the transferor at death cannot be transferred by a transfer on death deed, just as 4 
it cannot be transferred by a will. This is the principle of ademption by extinction, 5 
discussed in the Comment to Section  11. 6 
In almost every instance, the transferor will own the property not only at death but 7 
also when the transfer on death deed is executed, but the latter is not imperative. Consider 8 
the following example. H and W, a married couple, hold Blackacre as tenan ts by the 9 
entirety. H executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for Blackacre in 10 
favor of X. W later dies, at which point H owns Blackacre in fee simple absolute. Later, H 11 
dies. Under the law of some states, there may be a question wheth er the transfer on death 12 
deed is effective, given that H executed it when Blackacre was owned, not by H and W, 13 
but by the marital entity. The correct answer is that the transfer on death deed is effective 14 
at H's death because Blackacre is owned by H at H's death. See, e.g., Mitchell v. 15 
Wilmington Trust Co.,  449 A.2d 1055 (Del. Ch. 1982) (mortgage granted by one tenant 16 
by the entirety is not void upon execution but remains inchoate d uring the lives of both 17 
spouses  and becomes a valid lien if the spouse who e xecuted the mortgage survives the 18 
other spouse or if the spouses get divorced).  19 
The second default rule established by subsection (a) is that the interest of a 20 
designated beneficiary is contingent on surviving the transferor. This default rule treats 21 
wills  and will substitutes alike. The interest of a designated beneficiary who fails to 22 
survive the transferor lapses. On the desirability of extending statutory antilapse 23 
protection to will substitutes such as transfer on death deeds, see the Legislative Note.  24 
The third default rule established by subsection (a) is that concurrent beneficiaries 25 
receive equal and undivided interests with no right of survivorship among them. This 26 
default rule is consistent with the general presumption in favor of tenancy in commo n. 27 
See Powell on Real Property §51.02. The rule is also consistent with Uniform Probate 28 
Code Section 6 -212 governing multiple -party accounts and Section 6 -307 governing the 29 
transfer on death registration of securities.  30 
The fourth and last default rule esta blished by subsection (a) is that, in the event of 31 
the lapse or failure of an interest to be held concurrently, the share that lapses or fails 32 
passes proportionately to the surviving concurrent beneficiaries. Consider the following 33 
example:  34 
Example 4 .  A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 35 
Blackacre naming X, Y, and Z as the designated beneficiaries. X and Y survive A, but Z 36 
fails to survive A. The transfer on death deed is effective and, in the absence of an 37 
antilapse statute, transfers Blackacre to X and Y. This default rule is consistent with the 38 
transferor's probable intention in the absence of an antilapse statute and also with 39 
Uniform Probate Code Section 2 -604(b) on the lapse of a residuary devise. On the 40 
desirability of e xtending statutory antilapse protection to will substitutes such as transfer 41 
on death deeds, see the Legislative Note.  42 
 
 Page 16 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 Subsection (b) concerns the effect of transactions during the transferor's life. The 1 
subsection states an intermediate rule between two e xtremes. One extreme would provide 2 
that transactions during the transferor's life affect the beneficiary only if the transactions 3 
are recorded before the transferor's death. This would unfairly disadvantage the 4 
transferor's creditors and inter vivos transf erees. The other extreme would provide that 5 
transactions during the transferor's life always supersede the beneficiary's interest, even if 6 
the recording act would provide otherwise. Between these two positions is the rule of 7 
subsection (b).  8 
Subsection (b) provides that the beneficiary's interest is subject to all conveyances, 9 
encumbrances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the 10 
property is subject at the transferor's death. "Liens" includes liens arising by operation of 11 
law, such as state Medicaid liens.  12 
The only exception to this rule arises when the state recording act so provides. The 13 
state recording act will so provide only when two conditions are met: (1) the inter vivos 14 
conveyance or encumbrance is unrecorded through out the transferor's life (the legal 15 
fiction in this subsection protects persons who transact with the transferor and record any 16 
time before the transferor's death); and (2) the beneficiary is protected by the recording 17 
act. These two conditions will be me t only in rare instances. Most beneficiaries of transfer 18 
on death deeds are gratuitous, whereas state recording acts typically protect only 19 
purchasers for value. See Powell on Real Property §82.02.  20 
Subsection (c) provides that the survivorship right of a j oint owner takes precedence 21 
over the transfer on death deed. This rule is consistent with the law of joint tenancy and 22 
wills: the right of survivorship takes precedence over a provision in a joint tenant's will.  23 
Subsection (d) states the mandatory rule tha t a transfer on death deed transfers the 24 
property without covenant or warranty of title. The rule is mandatory for two reasons: 25 
first, to prevent mishaps by uninformed grantors; and second, to recognize that a transfer 26 
on death deed is a will substitute. T he rule of this section is consistent with the 27 
longstanding law of wills. As stated by Sir Edward Coke, "an express warranty cannot be 28 
created by will." Coke on Littleton 386a.  29 
§6-414.  Disclaimer  30 
A beneficiary may disclaim all or part of the beneficiary's  interest as provided by 31 
section 2 -801. 32 
Comment  33 
A beneficiary of a transfer on death deed may disclaim the property interest the deed 34 
attempts to transfer. While this section relies on other law, such as the Uniform 35 
Disclaimer of Property Interests Act (19 99/2006), to govern the disclaimer, two general 36 
principles should be noted.  37 
First, there is no need under the law of disclaimers to execute a disclaimer in 38 
advance.  During the transferor's life, a designated beneficiary has no interest in the 39 
 
 Page 17 - 128LR0425(01) -1 
 property. Se e Section 12. Nothing passes to the designated beneficiary while the 1 
transferor is alive, hence there is no need to execute a disclaimer during that time.  2 
Second, an effective disclaimer executed after the testator's death "relates back" to the 3 
moment of t he attempted transfer, here the death of the transferor. Because the disclaimer 4 
"relates back," the beneficiary is regarded as never having had an interest in the 5 
disclaimed property. The Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act (1999/2006) 6 
(UPC Articl e 2, Part 11) reaches this result, without using the language of relation back, 7 
in UDPIA Section 6(b)(1): "The disclaimer takes effect as of the time the instrument 8 
creating the interest becomes irrevocable ...." As the Comment to UDPIA Section 6 9 
explains,  "This Act continues the effect of the relation back doctrine, not by using the 10 
specific words, but by directly stating what the relation back doctrine has been interpreted 11 
to mean."  12 
§6-415.  Liability for creditor claims and statutory allowances  13 
A benefic iary of a transfer on death deed is liable for an allowed claim against the 14 
transferor's probate estate and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse and children to 15 
the extent provided in section 6 -107. 16 
Comment  17 
Alternative A defers to other law, such as Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -102, to 18 
establish the liability of a beneficiary of a transfer on death deed for creditor claims and 19 
statutory allowances.  20 
Uniform Probate Code (UPC) Section 6 -102 was added in 1998 to establish the 21 
principle that recipients of nonprobate transfers can be required to contribute to pay 22 
allowed claims and statutory allowances to the extent the probate estate is insufficient. 23 
The fundamental rule of liability is contained in UPC Section 6 -102(b): "Except as 24 
otherwise provided by statute, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability 25 
to any probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against the decedent's probate 26 
estate and statutory allowances to the decedent's spouse and children to the extent the 27 
estate is  insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The liability of a nonprobate 28 
transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that 29 
transferee." The other provisions of UPC Section 6 -102 implement this liability r ule. 30 
For states not favoring the comprehensive approach of UPC Section 6 -102(b) or the 31 
equivalent, Alternative B provides an in rem liability rule applying to transfer on death 32 
deeds. The property transferred under a transfer on death deed is liable to the  transferor's 33 
probate estate for properly allowed claims and statutory allowances to the extent the 34 
estate is insufficient.  35 
One of the functions of probate is creditor protection. UPC Section 6 -102, referenced 36 
in Alternative A, attempts to provide comprehe nsive creditor protection within the realm 37 
of nonprobate transfers. In addition, this act in Alternative B provides more creditor 38 
protection than is typically available under current law. For many transferors, the transfer 39 
on death deed will be used in lie u of joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Under the 40 
usual law of joint tenancy, the unsecured creditors of a deceased joint tenant have no 41 
 
 Page 18 - 128LR04 25(01) -1 
 recourse against the property or against the other joint tenant. Instead, the property passes 1 
automatically to t he survivor, free of the decedent's debts. See Comment 5 to UPC 2 
Section 6 -102. If the debts cannot be paid from the probate estate, the creditor is out of 3 
luck. Under Alternative B, in contrast, the property transferred under a transfer on death 4 
deed is li able to the probate estate for properly allowed claims and statutory allowances to 5 
the extent the estate is insufficient.  6

The transfer on death deed is likely to be used by consumers for whom the 32 
preparation of a tailored inter vivos revocable trust is too costly. The form in this section 33 
is designed to be understandable and consu mer friendly.  34
