6 beginning January 1, 2018. It removes the 5-year experience requirement in the bill for 
7 property and casualty insurance adjusters to be deemed workers' compensation insurance 
8 adjusters and provides that those individuals licensed as property and casualty insurance 
9 adjusters on January 1, 2018 will be granted both property and casualty and workers' 
10 compensation authorities. This amendment also extends the exemption in current law 
11 applicable to licensure for property and casualty insurance adjusters who are employees 
12 of insurers to include workers' compensation insurance adjusters. The amendment also 
13 adds an effective date of January 1, 2018.

Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would split the current adjuster's license into two seperate categories. The broad category would remain, 
however there would be a workers' compensation adjuster only license. For anyone who took advantage of this new 
license who wasn't otherwise licensed, the Bureau oflnsurance (BOI), within the Department of Professional and 
Financial Regulation, would receive a license fee. The increase in revenue from the increase in licenses is expected to 
be minor.
