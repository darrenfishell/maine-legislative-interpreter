23 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT «A" to H.P. 1206, L.D. 1726 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the 
provisions in the bill that make changes to the laws governing political activities at the 
polling place. It also removes the provision of the bill that removes language that allows 
an authorized person to sign a petition for a direct initiative of legislation or a people's 
veto referendum on behalf of a voter at that votds direction. The amendment removes a 
section in the bill that makes changes to the laws governing when a notary public or other 
person authorized to administer oaths is prohibited from administering an oath to a 
circulator of a petition for a direct initiative of legislation or people's veto referendum and 
replaces it with a new section. The new section provides that a notary public or other 
person authorized to administer oaths is not authorized to administer an oath to a 
circulator of a petition for a direct initiative of legislation or people's veto referendum 
petition if that notary public or other person has provided services to initiate or promote 
that direct initiative of legislation or people's veto referendum. Finally, the amendment 
makes changes to the deadlines governing submission of municipal official candidate 
nomination papers, municipal official candidate withdrawals and petitions for local 
option elections on the sale of liquor. These deadline changes make those provisions 
consistent with other deadlines enacted for similar submissions under Public Law 2017, 
chapter 248.
