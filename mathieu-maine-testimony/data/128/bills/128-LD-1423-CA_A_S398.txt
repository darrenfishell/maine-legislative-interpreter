128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " A " to S.P. 493, L.D. 1423, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend Certain Laws Governing Child Care Providers" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 2 to 9 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 2. 22 MRSA §8301-A, sub-§1-A, 1C, as amended by PL 2005, c. 530, §7, 
is further amended to read: 
C. "Family child care provider" means a person who provides day care in that 
person's home on a regular basis, for consideration, for ~ 1 to 12 children under 13 
years of age who are not the children of the provider or who are not residing in the 
provider's home. If a provider is caring for children living in that provider's home 
and is caring for no more than i 1 other children, the provider is not required to be 
certified as a family child care provider.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. It retains only those 
sections of the bill that allow a person who receives a child care subsidy to make up the 
difference between the amount of the subsidy and the total cost of the child care without 
losing the subsidy and allow a person to care for up to 4 children in the person's home 
without that person being required to become certified as a family child care provider.

This bill will reduce General Fund licensing revenue collected by the Depmiment of Health and Human Services by 
$160 annually beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 due to allowing a person to care for up to 4 children in the person's 
home without that person's being required to become certified as a family child care provider. Currently there are two 
providers that fall into this category and the current license fee is $160 every 2 years.
