This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $27 ,500 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $22,500 in fiscal year 2018-19 
to a newly created Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program within the Finance Authority of Maine to establish and 
administer a student loan forgiveness program for teachers to match student loan forgiveness funds awarded to 
teachers under the United States Depaitment of Education's teacher loan forgiveness program. Of these amounts, 
$10,000 per year is for administrative costs and $5,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 is for one-time rulemaking costs. The 
balance of $12,500 per year reflects the cost of forgiving one loan each year. The actual cost of this provision will not 
be known until the number of teachers who apply and are deemed eligible for this program are identified, but the cost 
is expected to be significant. In order for funds to be awarded to all eligible teachers under this program, additional 
General Fund appropriations will be required.
