Page 1 - 128LR2830(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the City of Bath is authorized pursuant to state law and its charter  to 
4 borrow money and to issue its general obligation bonds  and notes in furtherance of its 
5 municipal purposes;  and
6 Whereas, at a city referendum held November  7, 2017, the voters  of the city voted 
7 to adopt a bond  ordinance  that authorized the city to issue up to $2,800,000 of its general 
8 obligation bonds and notes  to finance  sidewalks  and street  and road construction,  
9 reconstruction and paving projects, as described in the notices, warrants  and ballots for 
10 the referendum;  and
11 Whereas, the voters  of the city voted in favor  of the bond  question, 1,834 in favor 
12 and 396 against, with 108 blank ballots; and
13 Whereas, Section 1009 of the city charter requires that the complete text of the bond 
14 ordinance be published  in a newspaper of general circulation in the city not less than 10 
15 days nor more than 15 days prior to the election;  and
16 Whereas, while  the complete text of the bond ordinance was published in a 
17 newspaper of general circulation in the city, it was published 4 days prior  to the election 
18 and not between 10 and  15 days prior  to the election;  and
19 Whereas, the failure to publish the text of the bond ordinance as strictly  required by 
20 the city charter creates a legal technicality that could affect the marketability of the bonds 
21 or notes to be issued by the  city in connection  with the projects; and
22 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
23 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
24 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
25 therefore,
26 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
27 Sec. 1.  Validation and authorization.  Notwithstanding any provision of the 
28 Maine Revised  Statutes or the charter of the City of Bath to the contrary, the City of Bath 
29 referendum conducted  on November  7, 2017 and the proceedings  related to that 
30 referendum are validated and made effective.  The City of Bath  is authorized  to enter into 
31 contracts and to issue bonds  or notes  of the city in an amount  not to exceed $2,800,000 to 
32 finance sidewalks  and street and road construction, reconstruction and paving  projects,  all 
33 as set forth in "Bond  Ordinance - Question One"  of the warrant and ballot for the 
34 referendum.
35 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
36 legislation takes effect when  approved.
