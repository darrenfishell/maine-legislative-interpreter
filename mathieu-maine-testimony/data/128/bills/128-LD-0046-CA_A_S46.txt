Consistency among Medical Professionals with Regard to Jury Duty Exemption" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Provide Consistency with Regard to Jury Duty Exemption' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 14 MRSA §1211, as amended by PL 2005, c. 60, § 1, is further amended to 
read: 
§1211. Disqualifications and exemptions from jury service 
A prospective juror is disqualified to serve on a jury if that prospective juror is not a 
citizen of the United States, 18 years of age and a resident of the county, or is unable to 
read, speak and understand the English language. The following persons are exempt 
from serving as jurors: The Governor, judges, physieiatts attd dentists providittg aeti11e 
patient eare, veterittariafls with or iH aH aefr,ze veterinary medieine praetiee, sheriffs, 
attorne~·s at la-v,r active duty military and all persons exempt under Title 37-B, section 
185.' 
SUMMARY 
Current law requires that all persons chosen for jury service must be selected at 
random from the broadest feasible cross-section of the population. The bill proposes 
achieving consistency in exemptions among medical professionals by adding nurse 
practitioners who are providing active patient care to other medical professionals who are 
providing active patient care and are currently exempt. This amendment creates 
consistency among medical professionals and others by removing all statutory 
exemptions from jury duty except for the Governor, active duty military and deployed 
state National Guard, thus increasing the juror pool.
