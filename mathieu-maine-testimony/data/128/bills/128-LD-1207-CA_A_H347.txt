HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 843, L.D. 1207, Bill, "An Act To 
Make Technical Changes to Maine's Marine Resources Laws" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, under current law the allowable bait for fishing for lobsters is unclear, 
restrictions on holders of marine harvesting demonstration licenses are preventing activity 
during the busiest summer months and the State's ability to track sales of marine 
organisms is hindered; and 
Whereas, the State's marine industries provide significant economic benefit; and 
Whereas, providing clarity, expanding economic opportunities and allowing 
effective management of the State's marine industries are necessary before the summer 
season begins; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1. 
Amend the bill in section 2 in subsection 1 in the last 2 lines (page 1, lines 14 and 15

animal hide from which the hair has been removed or fat attached to an animal hide from 
which the hair has been removed as long as the total thickness of fat and animal hide does 
not exceed 1 1/4 inches.'

6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment retains the provisions of the bill that prohibit the sale of offal for use 
8 as bait to fish for or take lobsters or crabs and that exempt the holder of a marine 
9 harvesting demonstration license from the prohibition on hauling on Sundays in the 
10 summer. 
11 The amendment removes the provision of the bill that specifies that license 
12 revocation for a conviction of scrubbing egged lobsters may be permanent. 
13 The amendment removes the provision of the bill limiting the commercial pelagic 
14 and anadromous fishing license to residents unless a nonresident's state allows residents 
15 of Maine to fish for those species in that state. 
16 The amendment provides that the definition of "offal" does not include fat attached to 
17 an animal hide from which the hair has been removed as long as the total thickness of fat 
18 and animal hide does not exceed 1 1/4 inches. The amendment provides that a holder of a 
19 Class I, Class II or Class III lobster and crab fishing license or noncommercial lobster and 
20 crab fishing license is not eligible to obtain a marine harvesting demonstration license 
21 and that the Commissioner of Marine Resources may permanently revoke the marine 
22 harvesting demonstration license of a person who sells, retains, ships or transports any 
23 portion of the catch or does not release all organisms alive into the area from which the 
24 organisms were harvested under that license. The amendment requires the holder of a 
25 retail seafood license buying directly from a harvester a species for which an electronic 
26 reporting requirement is in place to obtain an endorsement for that species from the 
27 Department of Marine Resources at no cost.

Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue decrease -General Fund 
Any additional costs to the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) from modifications to the definition of offal, 
marine demonstration license eligibility requirements and seafood license endorsement requirements are anticipated l 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Provisions allowing DMR to permanently revoke 
the marine demonstration license of a person who does not release or return organisms harvested for demonstration 
purposes may result in a minor loss of General Fund revenue.
