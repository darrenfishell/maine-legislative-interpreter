39 COMMIITEE AMENDMENT "H" to H.P. 1112, L.D. 1616 
Section 1 corrects a clerical error in the law governing the use of income from the 
rental of facilities in Limestone. 
Sections 2 and 3 correct grammatical errors in the reporting requirements concerning 
agricultural fairs that receive slot machine revenue. 
Section 4 revises section 34 of the bill, concerning the powers and duties of the 
Maine State Housing Authority, to remove paragraph 0, which is amended in another bill 
that includes the same corrections. 
Sections 5 and 6 repeal and replace 2 exceptions from the prohibition on sharing tax 
information to resolve conflicts created by Public Law 2015, chapter 490 and Public Law 
2015, chapter 494. Section 5 repeals and replaces the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, 
section 191, subsection 2, paragraph ZZ, which addresses information concerning Pine 
Tree Development Zones. Section 6 repeals and replaces Title 36, section 191, 
subsection 2, paragraph AAA, which addresses sharing of information with the Office of 
Program Evaluation and Government Accountability to facilitate the review of tax 
expenditures. Section 6 also acknowledges that Public Law 2017, chapter 211 enacts a 
new subsection 2, paragraph CCC, so there is no longer a need for "and" at the end of 
paragraph AAA. 
Sections 7 and 8 change the tenn "husband and wife" to "spouses" in the tax laws 
governing property tax exemptions for veterans and the real estate transfer tax. 
Section 9 amends an amending clause in a public law chapter by adding a reference 
to a public law chapter that was erroneously omitted and that amended the composition of 
the Board of Trustees of the University of Maine System. 
Section 10 amends a clerical error in the name of the Greater Augusta Utility District 
in the original private and special law. 
Part C of the amendment does the following. 
Section 1 corrects a drafting error made in Public Law 2017, chapter 143, and section 
4 provides that the changes are effective 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, which is 
the effective date of Public Law 2017, c. 143. 
Section 2 corrects a drafting error in Public Law 2017, chapter 179 concerning 
contracts involving the Maine Community College System. This section corrects the 
provision to provide that a contract that contains one or more of the listed prohibited 
provisions is not void, as the language in chapter 179 states, but that the provisions are 
void; the rest of the contract is not affected. Section 4 provides that the changes are 
effective 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, which is the effective date of Public Law 
2017, chapter 179. 
Section 3 amends a statute governing home heating oil delivery drivers to correct a 
cross-reference to a provision that would otherwise prohibit home heating oil delivery 
drivers from bleeding a residential home heating oil burner because they lack a license 
from the Maine Fuel Board. Section 39 of the bill incorrectly addressed this issue.
