22 SUMMARY 
23 This amendment is the majority report of the committee. Like the bill, the 
24 amendment provides a defense to prosecution for an owner of a vehicle if a person other 
25 than the owner is charged with eluding a law enforcement officer. The amendment adds 
26 to the provision that, if asked by a law enforcement officer, the owner must disclose the 
27 name of the operator of the vehicle. The amendment extends the defense available to a 
28 dealer or transporter to a dealer who loans the vehicle using loaner plates.
