Public Law 2013, c. 368 enacted legislation that shifted the responsibility for funding the normal cost of teacher 
retirement from the State to local school administrative units with the State contributing a percentage of the cost as 
part of its contribution to the total cost of Pre-K-12 public education through the General Purpose Aid for Local 
Schools program (GPA). This legislation proposes to repeal that law and return the responsibility for fully funding 
the normal cost component of teachers' retirement back to the State. The net General Fund cost of this proposal is 
$22,243,151 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $22,329,171 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $45,274,070 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $46,519,107 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Teacher Retirement program, within the Department of Education as a result of the State being 
required to fund 100% of the normal cost of teacher retirement. 
This bill also includes General Fund deappropriations of $23,030,919 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $24,189,936 in fiscal 
year 2018-19 to the GPA program, within the Department of Education, to remove the State's share of the normal cost 
of teacher retirement, estimated to be 50.87 % in fiscal year 2017-18 and 52.00% in fiscal year 2018-19.
