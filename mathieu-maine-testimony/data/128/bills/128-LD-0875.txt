SUMMARY  13 
This bill changes the formula for calculating distributions of state -municipal revenue - 14 
sharing funds.  The bill provides that rev enue -sharing funds will be distributed only to 15 
municipalities with mill rates exceeding 10 mills.  The bill also provides an adjustment 16 
that results in greater reimbursements to municipalities that have a lower mill rate than 17 
their average mill rate for th e preceding 5 years than to municipalities that do not.  The 18 
new distribution formula applies beginning in the 2018 -19 fiscal year.  19
