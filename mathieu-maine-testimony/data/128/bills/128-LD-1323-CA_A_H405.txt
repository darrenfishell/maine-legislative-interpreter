SUMMARY 
This amendment adds sections to the bill regarding certifying and notarizing petitions 
for a direct initiative or people's veto referendum. The amendment requires that a 
circulator sign a petition in the presence of a notary public or other authorized person to 
verify by oath or affirmation that the circulator personally witnessed all signatures to the 
petition. After administration of the oath or affirmation by the notary public or other 
authorized person, the notary public or other authorized person is required to sign the 
notarial certificate in the presence of the circulator. It also requires the notary public or 
other authorized person to maintain a log of the petitions for which the notary public or 
other authorized person administered the circulator's oath. 
The amendment also provides that a notary public or other authorized person is 
prohibited from notarizing a petition for a direct initiative or people's veto if the notary 
public or other authorized person is employed or compensated by a petition organization 
or ballot question committee for any purpose other than providing notarial acts.
