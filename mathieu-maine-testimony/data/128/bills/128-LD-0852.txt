 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA ยง2513, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 45, Pt. A, ยง4, is amended to 2 
read:  3 
ยง2513.  Notice required  4 
Every plaintiff seeking damages under this Act must give written notice to all 5 
defendants within 180 days of the date of the server's conduct creating liability under this 6 
Act.  The notice must specify the time, place and circumstances of the server's conduct 7 
creating liability under this Act and the time, place and circumstances of any resulting 8 
damages.  No error or omission in the notice voids the effect of the notice, if otherwise 9 
valid, unless the error or omission is substantially material.  Failure to give written notice 10 
within the time specified is grounds for dismissal of a claim , unless the plaintiff provides 11 
written notice within the limits of section 2514 and shows good cause why notice could 12 
not have reasonably been filed within the 180 -day limit.  For purposes of this section, 13 
"good cause" includes the inability of the plaint iff to obtain investigative records from a 14 
law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency.  15 
SUMMARY  16 
This bill amends the Maine Liquor Liability Act to provide that the inability of a 17 
plaintiff to obtain investigative records from a law enforcement office r or law 18 
enforcement agency constitutes good cause as to why the plaintiff could not reasonably 19 
file notice to all defendants within the 180 -day limit.  20
