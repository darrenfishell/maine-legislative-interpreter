SUMMARY  5 
This bill amends the marine resources licensing consent to inspection provision to 6 
allow marine pat rol to place covert electronic surveillance equipment on lobster vessels 7 
for the purpose of determining if a license holder is violating any laws or rules regarding 8 
the hauling of lobster gear.  It also creates a process under which the covert electronic 9 
surveillance equipment may be used, including the requirement for probable cause. It 10 
expands the violations for which a marine resources license may be administratively 11 
suspended to include the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17 -A, chapter 15, theft, chapter 12 
31, offenses against public administration, and criminal offense against a marine patrol 13 
officer.  These are already included in the list of violations for which a license may be 14 
suspended following conviction.  Violations of Title 17 -A, chapter 33, arson and other 15 
property destruction, are added to both license suspension provisions, administrative 16 
suspension and following conviction.  17
