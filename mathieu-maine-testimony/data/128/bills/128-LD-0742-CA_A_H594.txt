Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would allow growers of industrial hemp licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry (ACF) to grow industrial hemp from a clone or tissue cultures removed from live crops grown from a 
certified seed source. The bill would also direct ACF to adopt rules for the application and licensing of industrial 
hemp grown indoors, but only if the license is for an academic research program conducted through a post-secondmy 
institution. Any additional costs to the ACF as a result ofrulemaking are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. 
Because any additional licensees or licensed acreage would be limited to those involved in research activities through 
post-secondary institutions, it is estimated that there will be a limited number of program participants, generating 
minor Other Special Revenue Funds revenue.
