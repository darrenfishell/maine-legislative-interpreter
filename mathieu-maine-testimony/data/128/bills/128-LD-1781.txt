2 commissioner shall enter into an agreement on behalf  of the State with the qualified 
3 applicant. That agreement must provide  that:
4 (1)  The State  shall allow the credit provided  for in this section  as it is in effect on

20 50% or more of the voting  stock of the certified applicant, application may be made  
21 to the commissioner to approve transfer  of the certificate of approval  to that person in 
22 connection with the transfer of the stock  or facility.   The commissioner shall grant the

30 the transferee intends to continue  the operations of the shipbuilding facility in 
31 substantially the same manner as prior to the transfer  and has the financial 
32 capability to do so.  In addition, prior to approval of any transfer, the 
33 commissioner may request and be provided with the report and audit of the 
34 transferor pursuant  to section 6854.  The commissioner may condition the 
35 approval of  the transfer  based  upon the findings of  the report and  audit.
36 If the commissioner grants  a transfer of the certificate of approval, the transferee 
37 must be treated as the certified applicant for all purposes of this section.  For 
38 purposes of calculation of employment and qualified  investments  of the certified 
39 applicant, the qualified employees and the qualified investments of the transferor 
40 prior to transfer must be considered the qualified employees  and qualified 
41 investments of the  transferee.
42 E.  A certificate  of approval  must be revoked by the commissioner if the certified 
43 applicant has not made  qualified investments  of at least $100,000,000 within 5 years 
44 after issuance of the certificate of approval.  A certified applicant  whose certificate of 
Page 4 - 128LR2789(01)-11 approval is revoked  within 5 years  after issuance of the certificate of approval shall

34 SUMMARY
35 For tax years beginning on or after January  1, 2020 and continuing for the next 19 
36 years, this bill provides a tax incentive  for major  investments in a shipbuilding facility 
37 and the preservation  of jobs at that shipbuilding facility by allowing the shipbuilding 
38 facility an annual income tax credit equal to 3% of the shipbuilding facility's  total 
39 qualified investment,  as long as certain employment levels are maintained.  In order  to 
40 qualify for the credit, the shipbuilding facility must make  expenditures after January 1, 
41 2018 of at least $100,000,000 that are related to the construction,  improvement, 
Page 6 - 128LR2789(01)-11 modernization or expansion of the shipbuilding facility and maintain at least 5,000 
2 employees.  If the shipbuilding facility  employs  at least 5,250 employees, the facility is 
3 entitled to an amount equal to 110%  of the credit.   The facility may employ fewer than 
4 5,000 employees in 2 separate years  within the 20-year period and still qualify for the 
5 credit, but at a prorated reduction.
6 The purpose of this bill is to encourage  major  investments in shipbuilding facilities in 
7 this State, to ensure the long-term survival of the shipbuilding industry, to preserve 
8 numerous opportunities for jobs for the people of this State  and to make the State more  
9 competitive in the shipbuilding industry and thus ensure the preservation and betterment 
10 of the economy of the  State  for the benefit  of its people.
