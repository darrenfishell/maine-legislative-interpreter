128th MAINE LEGISLATURE 
LD 1775 LR 2810(03) 
An Act To Further Delay the Implementation of Certain Provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act 
Fiscal Note for House Amendment ''A" to Committee Amendment nA" 
Sponsor: Rep. Fredette of Newport 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential loss of revenue from delayed marijuana sales 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Delaying the implementation of the provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act (MLA) from April 18, 2018 to 
January 31 > 2019 or to the effective date of legislation approving rules implementing the MLA, whichever is earlier, 
may reduce revenue anticipated to be received through the sale of marijuana. Current estimates had already assumed 
that these revenues would begin to ramp up at the beginning of January of 2019. If the ramp up begins at the end of 
January of2019 there may be some loss ofrevenue in fiscal year 2018-19. As the delay from this amendment related 
to revenue assumptions is only one month at most and possibly less, depending on subsequent legislation, the amount 
of any reduction is not expected to be significant and no revenue loss is booked at this time.
