FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT" A" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 165, 
L.D. 209, Bill, "An Act To Amend the Laws Governing Temporary Sign Usage" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 by striking out all of paragraph L and inserting 
the following: 
'L. Temporary signs placed within the public right-of-way for a maximum of 6 12 
weeks per calendar year. A temporary sign may not be placed within 30 feet of 
another temporary sign bearing the same or substantially the same message. A 
temporary sign may not exceed 4 feet by 8 feet in size. A sign under this paragraph 
must be labeled with include or be marked with the name and address of the 
individual, entity or organization that placed the sign within the public right-of-way 
and the designated time period the sign will be maintained v,rithin the publie right of 
way.' 
SUMMARY 
The bill, as amended by Committee Amendment 11A,11 requires that temporary signs 
placed in the public right-of-way be marked with the date that the sign was erected. This 
amendment removes that requirement and eliminates the requirement in current law that 
such temporary signs be labeled with the designated time period that the sign will be 
maintained.
