128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
HOUSE AMENDMENT" A» to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 716, 
L.D. 1014, Bill, "An Act To Require a Person To Notify Law Enforcement Officers of 
the Possession of a Hypodermic Needle" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 in subsection 1 in the last line (page 1, line 20 in 
amendment) by striking out the following: "or detention" 
SUMMARY 
Committee Amendment "A" provides that a person is guilty of the Class D crime of 
failure to inform a law enforcement officer of a hypodermic apparatus if the person in 
fact has a hypodermic apparatus in possession on the person's body and the person in fact 
fails to inform a law enforcement officer that the person is in possession of a hypodermic 
apparatus on the person's body during the course of any arrest or detention of the person. 
This amendment removes criminal liability for a person who fails to inform a law 
enforcement officer that the person is in possession of a hypodermic apparatus on the 
person's body during the course of any detention so that only a person who fails to inform 
a law enforcement officer that the person is in possession of a hypodermic apparatus on 
the person's body during the course of any arrest is subject to criminal liability.
