SUMMARY  28 
This bill makes technical changes to Maine's marine resources laws.  It clarifies that 29 
license revocation for a conviction of scrubbing egged lobsters may be permanent.  It 30 
prohibits the sale of offal for use as b ait to fish for or take lobsters or crabs.  It creates a 31 
residency requirement for a commercial pelagic and anadromous fishing license, but 32 
allows for licensure of a nonresident if an applicant documents that the applicant's state of 33 
residence allows Maine  residents to purchase a license and fish for pelagic and 34 
anadromous species in that state.  Finally, it exempts the holder of a marine harvesting 35 
demonstration license from the prohibition on hauling on Sundays in the summer.  36
