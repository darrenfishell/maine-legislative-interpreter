128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 689, L.D. 1837, Bill, "An Act To 
Allow Cash Prizes for Certain Raf:(les Conducted by Charitable Organizations" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, recent changes to the laws governing raffles have hampered the ability of 
charitable nonprofits and civic organizations to conduct the types of raffles that generate 
a significant percentage of revenues raised by those organizations in a calendar year;· and 
Whereas, the law must be amended before the expiration of the 90-day period 
because charitable nonprofits and civic organizations use raffles to raise funds for their 
charitable purposes and it is a hardship for those groups to be limited in their fund raising; 
and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,1 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 17 MRSA §1837-A, sub-§§2 to 4, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. 
KKKKK, §25, are amended to read:
