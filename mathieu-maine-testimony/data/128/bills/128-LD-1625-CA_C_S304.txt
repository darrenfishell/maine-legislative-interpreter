Potential current biennium cost savings -General Fund 
The bill excludes the election of Governor, State Senator and State House representative from being required to use 
ranked-choice voting in general and special elections, but keeps it for United States Senator and United States 
Representative to Congress. It also keeps it for for all 5 positions for primary elections. Implementation is delayed 
until elections held after December 1, 2019, so no appropriations are required in this bill. 
Additional cost to the Department of Secretary of State associated with conducting a study and reporting the results 
can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
