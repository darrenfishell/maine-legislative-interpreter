SUMMARY  21 
This bill establishes a method of automatically registering eligible individuals to vote.  22 
The Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles, when receiving any 23 
documentation from an individual doing business with the bureau, including applying  for 24 
or renewing a driver's license or nondriver identification card, is required to scan and 25 
electronically store the documentation provided by the applicant.  If the documentation 26 
provides proof of eligibility to vote, including citizenship, age and resi dency, that 27 
individual is added to the central voter registration system and relevant information is 28 
transmitted to election officials unless the individual, at the time of the collection of the 29 
documentation, chooses not to be registered to vote.  30 
An appli cation or document used to collect information that may be used to register 31 
an individual must contain a notice that the individual's information may be used to 32 
register that individual to vote, meaning that the information would be available by 33 
persons ot her than the State or election officials.  An election official must provide the 34 
same notice to an individual upon receipt of the registration record from the Bureau of 35 
Motor Vehicles and also must inform the individual of the ability to choose not to be 36 
registered to vote and to pick a party affiliation. If the individual fails to respond within 37 
21 days, the individual is considered a registered voter.  38 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR0050(01) -1 
 The Secretary of State and the Governor are allowed to designate other state agencies 1 
and departments and  public and private entities, such as colleges and municipal clerk 2 
offices, as so -called source agencies that are allowed to submit registration information to 3 
the bureau for inclusion in the central voter registration system, but only if those 4 
agencies, a s part of their normal course of business, collect information that provides 5 
proof of eligibility to vote.  Beginning in 2022, an entity that is designated under the 6 
National Voter Registration Act of 1993 as a voter -registration agency that collects 7 
infor mation that provides proof of voter eligibility is designated a source agency.  A 8 
source agency is required to comply with the same restrictions regarding sharing and use 9 
of documentation as the bureau.  10 
Information from a source agency may also be used to update an individual's voter 11 
registration.  12
