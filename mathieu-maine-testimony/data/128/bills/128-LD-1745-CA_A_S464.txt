128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " (\" to S.P. 644, L.D. 1745, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding a Biomass-generated Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement and Payments to 
Contractors" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Establish the Wood Energy Program' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the Legislature intended, with the enactment of Public Law 2015, chapter 
483, to ensure that a biomass facility that was closed down would not qualify to 
participate in a competitive solicitation for biomass resources because it would fail to 
meet the requirement that a biomass facility was operational at least at a 50% capacity for 
60 days prior to the initiation of a competitive solicitation and continued to operate at that 
capacity except for planned or forced outages; and 
Whereas, a review of a contract for biomass resources to determine if contract 
requirements were met was just concluded at the Public Utilities Commission; and 
Whereas, the contract for biomass resources that was under review is with a 
biomass facility that received a contract in spite of the Legislature's intent to limit 
qualified applicants to those entities that were actively operating a biomass facility at the 
time a competitive solicitation was initiated; and 
Whereas, the Legislature wants to ensure that those funds provided in Public Law 
2015, chapter 483 that are not going to be paid to the biomass facility because not all 
contract requirements were met are used to support the forest products industry, 
especially since those requirements not met were those that would have directly benefited 
the forest products industry, and to do so this legislation must take effect immediately;

boilers or boilers using biofuels derived from wood; and the installation of new wood­
fueled boilers or boilers using biofuels derived from wood. 
Sec. 2. Contract evaluation; fund transfer. If, in its annual evaluation of a 2-
year contract entered into pursuant to Public Law 2015, chapter 483, the Public Utilities 
Commission finds that an entity that was awarded a contract for biomass resources is not

payment or any contract payment, those funds that would have been paid to the entity had 
contract requirements been met must be transferred to the wood energy fund established 
in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 10124, subsection 2. Notwithstanding 
Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection 5, any funds remaining in the cost 
recovery fund established in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection 5 that

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report and it replaces the bill. It specifies that, if the 
Public Utilities Commission finds that an entity awarded a contract for biomass resources 
pursuant to Public Law 2015, chapter 483 is not meeting contract requirements and 
therefore is not qualified to receive the full contract payment or any contract payment, 
those funds that would have been paid had contract requirements been met must be 
transferred to the wood energy fund. It also specifies that any funds remaining in the cost 
recovery fund established in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection 5 that 
are not needed to pay above-market costs for biomass resources must also be transferred 
by the Public Utilities Commission to the wood energy fund. It establishes the wood 
energy fund and creates the Wood Energy Program within the Efficiency Maine Trust. It 
requires the trust to use funds, if there are any, to provide incentives and low-interest or 
no-interest loans for new wood-derived thermal energy or cogeneration projects. It

$0 $0 $0 
At the close of fiscal year 2015-16 $13,400,000 was transferred from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund 
to the Cost Recove1y Fund at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to pay above-market costs of certain biomass 
contracts. This bill moves any money remaining from the transfer that is detennined by the PUC to not be needed for 
the original purpose to be credited to the newly created Wood Energy Fund within the Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT). 
The PUC has detem1ined that $766,027 is available to be directed into the Wood Energy Fund at this time. Transfers 
in addition to the $766,027 may be made in the future if the PUC makes certain detenninations. 
This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the Wood Energy Fund within the EMT of $266,027 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and $500,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to provide incentives and low or no-interest loans for new 
wood-derived thennal energy or co generation projects. Additional costs to the Finance Authority of Maine to consult 
with the EMT in the development of program incentives and distribution of funds from the wood energy fund where 
appropriate can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
