128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "p,,, to H.P. 39, L.D. 53, "RESOLUTION, 
Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Prohibit Payment Per 
Signature for Citizen Petition Drives" 
Amend the resolution by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Prohibit Payment per Signature on Petitions for Direct Initiatives and 
People's Veto Referendums' 
Amend the resolution by striking out everything after the title and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §904-C is enacted to read: 
§904-C. Payment per signature; prohibition 
1. Findings. The Legislature finds that the practice of paying persons who collect 
signatures for initiative or referendum petitions based on the number of signatures the 
persons collect has corrupted the signature collecting process and is eroding public 
confidence in the petition· process. The Legislature finds that the large numbers of 
invalidated signatures that have been collected during petition efforts by persons who 
were paid for the number of signatures collected provides strong evidence that the 
practice of paying for signatures collected has corrupted the signature gathering process. 
The Legislature further finds that the State has a vital interest in ensuring that the 
signature gathering process is not corrupted by practices that erode public confidence in 
the petition process. 
2. Payment per signature. A circulator of an initiative or a referendum petition, a 
direct initiative or people's veto organization registered in accordance with section 903-C 
or a person who causes the circulation of an initiative or referendum petition may not 
receive payment for the collection of signatures if that payment is based on the number of 
signatures collected. This section does not prohibit a circulator of an initiative or a 
referendum petition, a direct initiative or people's veto organization registered in

accordance with section 903-C or a person who causes the circulation of an initiative or 
referendum petition from being paid a salaiy or fee that is not based on the number of 
signatures collected.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution 
of Maine. The amendment instead amends the statutes governing ballot questions to 
prohibit the circulator of an initiative or referendum petition or a petition organization 
from receiving payment for the collection of signatures based on the number of signatures 
collected. The amendment clarifies that a salary or fee for the collection of signatures is 
not prohibited if it is not based on the number of signatures collected.
