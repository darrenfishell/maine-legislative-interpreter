This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment establishes the Statewide

and review the data and provide an annual report to the joint standing committees of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal justice and public safety matters and health

The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pmsuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill provides an ongoing appropriation of $1,560 to the Legislature for the costs of legislators serving on the 
Statewide Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. The Department of Public Safety will require a General Fund 
appropriation of $10,000 in fiscal year 2019-20 for the administrative cost to supp01t the Council. Additional costs to 
the Department of Conections and the Department of Health and Human Services associated with this legislation cat 
be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
