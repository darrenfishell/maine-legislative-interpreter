is presently designated a highly toxic chemical as described in section 1733.  Information 36 
developed and collected under this section must be added to the alternative chemical 37 
work plan.  38 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR1218(01) -1 
 §1736.  Transition prioriti es 1 
The transition team described in section 1734, subsection 2 shall develop a priority 2 
ranking of all highly toxic chemicals identified under section 1735 for use in determining 3 
priority for transition to safer alternatives.  The transition team may consi der other 4 
chemicals, both toxic and nontoxic, in a separate priority ranking.  In developing a 5 
priority ranking, the transition team shall, at a minimum, consider for each highly toxic 6 
chemical:  7 
1.  Exposure potential.  The frequency with which employees a re exposed to the 8 
highly toxic chemical or the likelihood of potential employee exposure to the highly toxic 9 
chemical;  10 
2.  Associated harms.  The potential harms associated with the highly toxic chemical 11 
as based on information available to the employer; a nd 12 
3.  Alternatives analysis.  An analysis of the anticipated difficulty of transitioning to 13 
a safer alternative, both from a technical and from a financial perspective, as determined 14 
under section 1737.  15 
Information developed and collected under this secti on must be added to the 16 
alternative chemical work plan.  17 
§1737.  Alternatives analysis  18 
For each highly toxic chemical identified under section 1735, the transition team shall 19 
develop an alternatives analysis that must:  20 
1.  Alternatives.  Identify all altern atives that can potentially and reasonably be 21 
substituted in place of the highly toxic chemical.  The employer shall contact chemical 22 
suppliers and manufacturers for possible safer alternatives;  23 
2.  Effects.  Evaluate the potential effects of transitioning  to each alternative, 24 
including, but not limited to, effects on energy use, water use, the environment and 25 
employee health and safety;  26 
3.  Harms.  Describe any potential harms associated with the alternative; and  27 
4.  Costs.  Provide a detailed financial an alysis of the potential short -term and long - 28 
term costs of substituting each alternative for a highly toxic chemical.  29 
The transition team shall review the analysis developed under this section and the 30 
priority ranking developed under section 1736 and shall determine the highly toxic 31 
chemicals identified under section 1735 for which safer alternatives will be tested and 32 
evaluated for transition under section 1738.  Information developed and collected under 33 
this section must be added to the alternative chemica l work plan.  34 
§1738.  Testing, evaluation and implementation of safer alternative  35 
1.  Develop testing process.  After review of all information generated or collected 36 
under sections 1736 and 1737, the transition team shall, for each highly toxic chemical, 37 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR1218(01) -1 
 determine whether to proceed with testing and evaluation of an alternative that the 1 
transition team determines to be a safer alternative.  The transition team shall develop and 2 
implement a process for testing and evaluating the feasibility of transition to a safer 3 
alternative.  4 
2.  Transition.  If, after testing and evaluation of the safer alternative pursuant to 5 
subsection 1, the transition team elects to proceed with transition on a permanent basis, 6 
the transition team shall develop and recommend a process for implementing a permanent 7 
transition to the safer alternative.  8 
3.  Permanent transition.  If the transition team recommends permanent transition 9 
pursuant to subsection 2 to the safer alternative and the safer alternative analysis under 10 
sections 1736 and  1737 and the testing and evaluation under subsection 1 are favorable, 11 
the employer shall, with the transition team, develop and implement a process for 12 
permanent transition to the safer alternative.  13 
4.  Process for decision of no transition.  If the emplo yer elects not to proceed with 14 
permanent transition pursuant to subsection 3, the employer shall record the basis for its 15 
decision.  The employer may not elect not to proceed with permanent transition without 16 
proper justification.  If the results of the sa fer alternative analysis under sections 1736 and 17 
1737 and the testing and evaluation under subsection 1 are favorable, the employer's 18 
decision not to proceed with the safer alternative is not justified.  19 
If the employer elects not to proceed with the use of  the safer alternative, the employer 20 
shall submit a report to the department detailing the basis for not proceeding.  21 
5.  Additional information for work plan.  Information developed and collected 22 
under this section must be added to the alternative chemical  work plan.  23 
§1739.  Discontinuance of safer alternative  24 
1.  Discontinuance of safer alternative.  At any time following completion of the 25 
permanent transition process to a safer alternative under section 1738, subsection 3, the 26 
employer may determine that substitution of the safer alternative is no longer technically, 27 
financially or otherwise feasible and elect to discontinue use of the safer alternative only 28 
if the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 are met.  29 
2.  Justification of discontinuance. The employer  may not discontinue use of a safer 30 
alternative following completion of the permanent transition process under section 1738, 31 
subsection 3 without proper justification. To justify a decision to discontinue use of the 32 
safer alternative, the employer shall, w ith the transition team, conduct another safer 33 
alternative analysis under sections 1736 and 1737 and review the testing and evaluation 34 
under section 1738, subsection 1.  If the results of the safer alternative analysis and 35 
testing and evaluation continue t o be favorable, the employer has not justified a decision 36 
to discontinue use of the safer alternative.  37 
3.  Report of discontinuance.  If the employer elects to discontinue use of a safer 38 
alternative under subsection 1, the employer shall submit a report to  the department 39 
detailing the basis for discontinuance.  Information developed and collected and reports 40 
submitted under this section must be added to the alternative chemical work plan.  41

Every 3 years, an employer shall certi fy that the employer has audited the employer's 2 
compliance with this chapter.  The audit must include review of the highly toxic 3 
chemicals previously identified in the alternative chemical work plan and review of 4 
whether there are new highly toxic chemical s to be evaluated for transitioning to safer 5 
alternatives. The employer shall develop a report of the audit findings and the response to 6 
the findings and shall also document that any deficiencies have been corrected. The audit 7 
report under this section mus t be added to the alternative chemical work plan, and the 8 
employer shall retain the 2 most recent audit reports on file pursuant to section 1742.  9 
§1741.  Reporting requirements  10

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill enacts the Toxic Chemicals in the Workplace Act to create a statutory and 2 
regulatory framework designed to prevent harm to employees by reducing exposure to 3 
highly toxic chemicals in the workplace and thereby decrease the rates o f cancer and 4 
other chronic diseases in the State, improve workplace chemical management and safety 5 
and ensure safer workplaces and healthier communities.  6 
This bill specifically:  7 
1.  Directs employers to identify highly toxic chemicals and directs the Depar tment of 8 
Labor to publish lists of online resources that identify highly toxic chemicals;  9 
2.  Requires employers subject to the provisions of the Act to develop and implement 10 
a written alternative chemical work plan and designate a transition team to assis t in 11 
transitioning from highly toxic chemicals in the workplace to safer alternatives;  12 
3.  Directs the transition team to inventory all chemicals in the workplace, both toxic 13 
and nontoxic, and determine which chemicals have been designated as highly toxic 14 
chemicals;  15 
4.  Requires the transition team to develop a priority ranking of all identified highly 16 
toxic chemicals, based on a number of criteria, to assist in determining which chemicals 17 
will be transitioned to safer alternatives;  18 
5.  Directs the transiti on team, as part of developing the priority ranking, to conduct 19 
for each highly toxic chemical an alternatives analysis that includes, among other things, 20 
a detailed financial analysis of the costs of substituting an alternative;  21 
6.  Requires the transitio n team to decide which alternatives to highly toxic chemicals 22 
are safer alternatives and which safer alternatives should be tested and evaluated for 23 
permanent transition.  After testing and evaluation of selected safer alternatives, the 24 
employer, with the transition team, may elect to transition to a safer alternative on a 25 
permanent basis;  26 
7.  Requires an employer to contact chemical suppliers and manufacturers for 27 
possible safer alternatives and to implement a process for permanent transition to the 28 
safer alternatives.  If the employer elects not to use safer alternatives, the employer must 29 
submit a report to the Department of Labor detailing the basis for not proceeding with the 30 
transition to the safer alternatives;  31 
8.  Requires employers to complete self -audits for compliance with this Act;  32 
9.  Stipulates reporting and records retention requirements for the employer, as well 33 
as guidelines for access to information by employees and state agencies;  34 
10.  Requires annual employee training that follows the Unit ed States Department of 35 
Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration's globally harmonized system of 36 
classification and labeling of chemicals;  37
