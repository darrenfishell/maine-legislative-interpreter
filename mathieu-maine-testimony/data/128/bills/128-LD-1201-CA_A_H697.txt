CO~ITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 838, L.D. 1201 
1 Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
2 Indians, to apply for and receive a license to operate a casino. 
3 2. It specifies that, as a condition of a joint tribal entity's receiving a license, a casino 
4 must be located: 
5 A. On land that on January 1, 2018 was owned by the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
6 Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs or the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
7 Indians or land held in trust by the United States or by any other person or entity for 
8 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band ofMicmacs or 
9 the Houlton Band ofMaliseet Indians; 
10 B. On land located in the unorganized territory; or 
11 C. On land in a municipality and that municipality approves of the operation of the 
12 casino in that municipality, either by vote of its legislative body or in a referendum of 
13 the voters of the municipality. 
14 3. It exempts a casino licensed to a joint tribal entity from the provision in current 
15 law that prohibits a new casino or slot machine facility from being located within 100 
16 miles of an existing casino or slot machine facility. The amendment provides that a 
17 casino licensed to a joint tribal entity may not be located within 50 miles of an existing 
18 facility. 
19 4. The amendment provides that a change in the composition of a joint tribal entity 
20 does not invalidate a casino license issued to the entity as long as the change occurs no 
21 sooner than 6 months after the license is issued and the entity still consists of at least 2 
22 federally recognized Indian tribes in the State who own equal shares of the entity in its 
23 entirety. 
24 5. Finally, the amendment changes the provision in current law .that states that 
25 distributions of net slot machine revenue from the casino located in Oxford County to the 
26 Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe revert to the operator if one or both 
27 operate or receive distributions from a newly licensed casino. The amendment provides 
28 that the distribution of that slot machine revenue would instead be deposited into the 
29 General Fund if either the Penobscot Nation or the Passamaquoddy Tribe operated or 
30 received distributions from a newly licensed casino.

This bill authorizes the Gambling Control Board to accept an application for a casino license from a joint tribal entity 
comprised of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band ofMicmacs and the Houlton Band of 
Maliseet Indians. The location of the facility cannot be located within 50 miles of an existing casino facility. The facility 
would be taxed at the rate of25% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill also requires that when 
the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation begin receiving distributions from the new joint tribal entity casino, the 
distributions they currently receive from the Oxford Casino will instead go to the General Fund. 
The bill exempts the applicant for a casino license from paying the $250,000 one-time non-refundable privilege fee and 
from the $5,000,000 minimun license fee required by MRSA Title 8, section 1018, subsection 1-A, but the applicant would 
be subject to an application fee of $225,000, a slot machine registration fee of $35,000, a table game initial privilege fee of 
$800,000 and a table game registration fee of $800. This would generate $1,060,800 in the first year for the Gambling 
Control Board. Renewal fees for the casino operator, slot machines registration, table games registration and a table games 
privilege fee will generate an estimated $123,800 annually thereafter. Annual state General Fund costs associated with 4 
positions and other related expenses are estimated to be $878,835 
Presented below is an estimate of the potential revenues that may be generated from the new facility and the subsequent 
distribution of those revenues. This fiscal note assumes a total of 350 slot machines and 8 table games, generating annual 
revenue of$5,475,373 for the State's General Fund. A reduction in revenue to Hollywood Casino and Oxford Casino is 
anticipated because of the increased competition for customers created by the new casino. That reduction's impact on the 
General Fund is not estimated at this time but would be pattially offset by this bill's provision that the current distributions 
from Oxford Casino to the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation be diverted to the General Fund once the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation begin receiving revenue from the new casino. Overall, the authorization of 
a third casino which distributes 25% of net slot machine income and 16% of net table game income to the General Fund 
will result in significant additional revenue to the General Fund.
