 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to prevent large fluctuations based on geographical location in the 5 
retail price of gasoline and  other motor fuel sold at service stations throughout the State.  6 
The bill proposes to prohibit a service station from charging more than a set amount for a 7 
gallon of motor fuel.  The retail price per gallon would be determined weekly and would 8 
be based on  the average cost of a gallon of that motor fuel for the State, as determined by 9 
the Governor's Energy Office, plus an allowance for transportation and staffing based on 10 
the geographical area in which the service station is located.  11
