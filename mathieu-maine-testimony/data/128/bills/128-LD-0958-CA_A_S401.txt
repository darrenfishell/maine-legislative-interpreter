32 SUMMARY 
33 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and adopts 
34 selected provisions of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act. This 
35 amendment does the following. 
36 I. It defines "volunteer health practitioner" as an individual who provides health 
37 services or veterinary services, whether or not the individual receives compensation, as 
3 8 long as the individual is not providing services in this State as part of a preexisting 
39 employment relationship. "Volunteer health practitioner" also includes individuals who 
Page 8 -128LR1409(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 314, L.D. 958 
1 are not state residents who provide health services or veterinary services in this State 
2 while employed by a disaster relief organization. 
3 2. It provides for advanced registration of volunteer health practitioners from this 
4 State or other states who agree to provide health services or veterinary services during a 
5 civil emergency or health emergency in this State declared by the Governor or the 
6 Department of Health and Human Services. Registration systems must determine 
7 whether registrants are licensed to provide health services or veterinary services and are 
8 in good standing with the relevant licensing entities in this State and other states. 
9 3. It authorizes volunteer health practitioners licensed in other states to provide health 
10 services and veterinary services in this State during a declared civil emergency or public 
11 health emergency. While an emergency declaration is in effect, the Department of Health 
12 and Human Services, in coordination with the Department of Defense, Veterans and 
13 Emergency Management, Maine Emergency Management Agency, may limit the 
14 duration and geographical areas in which a volunteer health practitioner may practice as 
15 well as types of volunteer health practitioners who are authorized to provide health 
16 services or veterinary services. 
17 4. It requires a volunteer health practitioner to comply with both the scope of practice 
18 laws in this State and the scope of practice laws in the state where the individual is 
19 licensed while providing health services or veterinary services in this State during a 
20 declared emergency. The Governor or the Governor's designee may by order modify or 
21 restrict the health services or veterinary services that a volunteer health practitioner may 
22 provide during a declared emergency. 
23 5. It subjects a volunteer health practitioner to discipline by the appropriate state 
24 licensing board for health services or veterinary services provided in this State during a 
25 declared emergency. An individual who is licensed in Maine and who provides health 
26 services or veterinary services during a declared emergency in another state as a 
27 volunteer health practitioner is also subject to discipline by the appropriate state licensing 
28 board. 
29 6. It protects a volunteer health practitioner from civil liability for injury or death 
30 arising out of the provision of health services or veterinary services in accordance with 
31 the requirements of the uniform act to the same extent that a health care practitioner in 
32 this State is protected from civil liability for volunteer activities under the Maine Health 
33 Security Act. 
34 7. It authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules to 
35 implement the uniform act in consultation with the Maine Emergency Management 
3 6 Agency and rule-making agencies in other states that have adopted similar legislation.
