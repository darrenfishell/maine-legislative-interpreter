 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1891, sub -§4, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. A, §1 2 
and affected by Pt. D, §1, is amended to read:  3 
B.  Adjudication of a person under this subchapter as a de facto par ent establishes 4 
parentage, and the court shall determine parental rights and responsibilities in 5 
accordance with section 1653.  The court shall make appropriate orders for the 6 
financial support for the child in accordance with the child support guidelines under 7 
chapter 63.  An order requiring the payment of support to or from a de facto parent 8 
does not relieve any other parent of the obligation to pay child support unless 9 
otherwise ordered by a court.  An order under this paragraph may not require the 10 
payme nt of child support from a de facto parent to another parent of the child if the 11 
de facto parent became a de facto parent due to the unwillingness or inability of the 12 
other parent to provide care for the child.  13 
SUMMARY  14 
This bill prohibits a child support o rder from requiring payment of child support from 15 
a de facto parent to another parent of the child if the de facto parent became a de facto 16 
parent due to the unwillingness or inability of the other parent to provide care for the 17 
child.  18
