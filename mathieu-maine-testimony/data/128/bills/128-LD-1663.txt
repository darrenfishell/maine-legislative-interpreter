Page 1 - 128LR2640(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  32 MRSA ยง11002,  sub-ยง2, as amended by PL 1995, c. 397, ยง101, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 2.  Conducting business in this State.  "Conducting business in this State"  means 
5 the collection  or attempted  collection of a debt due another by a debt collector located in 
6 this State; the face-to-face solicitation of creditors in this State as clients and the 
7 collection or attempted collection of their debts  by a debt collector, wherever  located; or 
8 the collection or attempted collection of debts incurred between a debt from a consumer 
9 in this State and  creditor  in this State  by a  debt collector, wherever located.
10 SUMMARY
11 This bill modernizes the Maine Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by removing  the 
12 condition that a debt collector's  solicitation of business from Maine creditors be "face to 
13 face" before  a license must be obtained and by requiring that a debt collector,  wherever  
14 located, obtain a  license before collecting debts from a  consumer in this State.
