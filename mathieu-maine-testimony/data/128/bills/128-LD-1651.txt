Page 1 - 128LR2425(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, implementing a system for the regulation and administration  of the 
4 cultivation, distribution  and retail sale of recreational marijuana, a controlled substance, is 
5 a complex function with significant financial  costs; and
6 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
8 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
9 therefore,

16 require a retail  marijuana  licensee, prior to selling or furnishing retail marijuana or a retail 
17 marijuana product to a consumer or to another  licensee, to submit the marijuana or 
18 marijuana product to a retail marijuana testing facility  for testing pursuant to this section 
19 to ensure  that the marijuana or marijuana product does not exceed the maximum level  of 
20 allowable contamination  for any contaminant that is injurious to health and for which 
21 testing is required and to ensure  correct  labeling.  The Commissioner of Agriculture,
