supplies and strive for a higher degree of protection around source water areas or areas 22 
that are used as public drinking water supplies; and to allow the State, municipalities and 23

public water supplies ; and to improve testing for and treatmen t of contaminants in 25 
residential private drinking water wells . 26

1.  Purpose.   The Legislature finds that there is a growing threat to the state's  State's  29 
drinking water  from a variety of contaminants and that testing of private residential water 30 
supplies may be  is necessary under certain circumstances  to protect the public health. The 31 
Legislature recognizes that certain testing may be prohibitively expensive and 32 
accordin gly provides for state -funded testing as set forth in this section.  33
