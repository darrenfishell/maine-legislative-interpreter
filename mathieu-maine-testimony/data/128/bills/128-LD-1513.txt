transmission and di stribution utilities to enter into long -term contracts for:  5 
A.  Capacity resources;  6 
B.  Any available energy associated with capacity resources contracted under 7 
paragraph A:  8 
(1)  To the extent necessary to fulfill the policy of subsection 2, paragraph A; or 9 
(2)  If the commission determines appropriate for purposes of supplying or 10 
lowering the cost of standard -offer service or otherwise lowering the cost of 11 
electricity for the ratepayers in the State.  Available energy contracted pursuant to 12 
this subparagr aph may be sold into the wholesale electricity market in 13 
conjunction with solicitations for standard -offer supply bids; and  14 
C.  Any available renewable energy credits associated with capacity resources 15 
contracted under paragraph A.  The price paid by the i nvestor -owned transmission 16 
and distribution utility for the renewable energy credits must be lower than the price 17 
received for those renewable energy credits at the time they are sold by the 18 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility.  19 
The commiss ion may permit, but may not require, investor -owned transmission and 20 
distribution utilities to enter into contracts for differences that are designed and intended 21 
to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 22 
developme nt.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 23 
for long -term contracts for investor -owned transmission and distribution utilities under 24 
this subsection having the same legal and financial effect as the procedures used for 25 
standard -offer service pursuant to section 3212 for investor -owned transmission and 26 
distribution utilities.  27 
The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible, demand response or energy 28 
efficiency capacity resources.  These contracts are not subject to  the rules of the State 29 
Purchasing Agent.  In a competitive solicitation conducted pursuant to subsection 6, the 30 
commission shall allow transmission and distribution utilities to submit bids for 31 
interruptible or demand response capacity resources.  32 
Capacity  resources contracted under this subsection may not exceed the amount 33 
necessary to ensure the reliability of the electric grid of this State, to meet the energy 34 
efficiency program budget allocations articulated in the triennial plan as approved by the 35 
comm ission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4 or any annual update plan approved 36 
by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 6 or to lower customer costs as 37 
determined by the commission pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 10.  38 
The commis sion may not direct an investor -owned transmission and distribution utility to 39 
enter into a long -term contract under this section unless the commission determines that 40 
the instate economic benefits substantially outweigh the expected costs of the contract.  41 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1508(01) -1 
 Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a capacity 1 
resource may not be contracted under this subsection unless the commission determines 2 
that the capacity resource is recognized as a capacity resource for purposes of any 3 
regional or federal capacity requirements.  4 
The commission shall ensure that any long -term contract authorized under this subsection 5 
is consistent with the State's goals for greenhouse gas reduction under Title 38, section 6 
576 and the regional greenhouse gas  initiative as described in the state climate action plan 7 
required in Title 38, section 577.  8 
SUMMARY  9 
This bill prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from directing an investor -owned 10 
transmission and distribution utility to enter into a long -term contra ct for capacity 11 
resources or energy or renewable energy credits associated with capacity resources unless 12 
the commission determines that the instate economic benefits substantially outweigh the 13 
expected costs of the contract.  14
