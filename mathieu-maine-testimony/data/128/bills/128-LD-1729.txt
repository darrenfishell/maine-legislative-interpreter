Page 1 - 128LR2706(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง316 is  enacted to read:
3 ยง316.  Customer-constructed  service drops
4 1.  Definitions.   As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
5 following terms  have the following  meanings.
6 A.  "Large transmission  and distribution utility"  means a transmission and 
7 distribution utility serving more than  500,000 retail  customers.
8 B.  "Service drop" means the service  cable or other conductor providing  secondary 
9 voltage to a customer's service entrance  equipment from  a transformer or from a 
10 secondary conductor, as defined by the commission by rule.
11 2.  Service drop reimbursements.  The construction and reimbursement of costs of 
12 the construction of a service  drop by a customer of a large transmission and distribution 
13 utility is governed  by the  following:
14 A.  At the request of the customer, the large transmission and distribution  utility shall 
15 reimburse a customer for a  customer-constructed service drop as long as:
16 (1)  The service drop is no more  than 150 feet in length if the service drop is 
17 located on the same side of the street as the large transmission and distribution 
18 utility's distribution facilities or no more than 200 feet if the service drop is 
19 located on the opposite side of the street from the large transmission and 
20 distribution utility's distribution facilities;  and
21 (2)  The service  drop meets  the National Electrical Safety Code and the large  
22 transmission and distribution utility's standards; and
23 B.  The price paid by the large  transmission and distribution utility to reimburse  the 
24 customer for a customer-constructed service drop, regardless of whether the service 
25 drop was constructed underground or aboveground, may not exceed the amount the 
26 large transmission and distribution utility would have expended if that utility had 
27 constructed an aboveground service drop to serve that customer.
28 3.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to carry  out the provisions of this 
29 section.  Rules  adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules  as defined 
30 in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
31 SUMMARY
32 This bill establishes requirements relating to so-called electric  service drops 
33 constructed by customers  of large electric transmission and distribution utilities.  The bill 
34 requires a utility to reimburse a customer for an aboveground or underground customer-
35 constructed service drop at the customer's request, but limits  the price to be paid to the 
36 cost the  utility  would have expended to construct an  aboveground service drop.
