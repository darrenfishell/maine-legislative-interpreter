Fiscal Note 
Contingent cunent biennium revenue increase -General Fund 
The bill increases the reimbursement amount for certified production wages from 12% to 25%, increases the cap on 
the reimbursement of wages from $50,000 to $100,000 and provides a reimbursement of 20% of nonwage production 
expenses. The implementation of these changes is contingent upon the development and evaluation of a dynamic 
fiscal analysis that results in a positive fiscal impact on revenue. Reimbursement costs from this bill without taking 
into account additional revenue generated from the dynamic aspect of the activity is estimated to be $750,000 to the 
General Fund in fiscal year 2018-19 and more than $1,000,000 in subsequent years. 
Additional costs to the Legislature's Office of Fiscal and Program Revi~w, the Department of Economic and 
Community Development, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and the University of Maine 
System can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
