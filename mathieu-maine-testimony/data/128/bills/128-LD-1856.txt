Page 1 - 128LR2925(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, this legislation,  regarding the burial of cremated remains,  must take effect 
4 before the expiration of the 90-day period so that it may apply  to burials  this spring; and
5 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
6 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
7 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
8 therefore,
9 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
10 Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง2843, sub-ยง3-A,  as enacted  by PL 2017, c. 101, ยง1, is 
11 amended to read:
12 3-A.  Permit  for burial  of cremated remains  in public burying  ground.  If 
13 cremated remains  are buried in a public burying ground in this State, the person  in charge 
14 of the public burying ground  shall  may endorse  and provide the date the cremated  
15 remains were buried on each permit with which that person is presented and return it to 
16 the State Registrar  of Vital Statistics  or to the clerk  of the municipality in which the 
17 public burying ground  is located within 7 days after the date of burial .  If there is no 
18 person in charge of the public  burying ground,  an official of the municipality in which  the 
19 public burying ground  is located shall may endorse and provide  the date the cremated 
20 remains were buried on each such permit  and present it to the State Registrar  of Vital  
21 Statistics or the clerk of the municipality.  The funeral director or authorized person shall 
22 may present a copy  of each permit, after endorsement if the permit has been  endorsed , to 
23 the State  Registrar of Vital Statistics or the clerk of the municipality where  death 
24 occurred and to the clerk who issued the permit.  For the purposes of this subsection,  
25 "public burying ground"  has the same meaning as in Title 13, section 1101-A, subsection  
26 4.
27 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
28 legislation takes effect when  approved.
29 SUMMARY
30 Current law requires a person in charge of a public burying ground  or, if no such 
31 person exists, an official of the municipality  where  the public burying ground is located, 
32 to endorse and provide  the date cremated remains were buried on the permit  for burial of 
33 cremated remains and return the permit  to the State Registrar  of Vital Statistics or the 
34 clerk of the municipality in which the public burying ground  is located.  It also requires  
35 the funeral director or authorized person  to present a copy of each permit, after 
36 endorsement, to the State Registrar of Vital  Statistics  or the clerk  of the municipality  
37 where the death occurred and to the clerk who issued the permit.   This bill makes these 
38 required actions voluntary.
