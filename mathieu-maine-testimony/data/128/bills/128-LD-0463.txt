SUMMARY  18 
This bill amends the laws on funding the county jails  and the transfer of prisoners 19 
among county jails and the Department of Corrections.  The bill clarifies that a county jail 20 
that receives a transfer of a prisoner from a sending county jail or the Department of 21 
Corrections may charge the sending county jai l or the Department of Corrections a per 22 
diem charge for the transferred prisoner.  The bill clarifies in the funding formula for 23 
county jails that the jails are credited for the prisoners who are committed to the custody 24 
of or detained by the sheriff of t hat county.  The bill removes the cap on tax assessments 25 
for correctional services that is specific to the jails and imposes the limitation on county 26 
assessments that applies more generally to the counties as set forth in the Maine Revised 27 
Statutes, Title 30-A, section 706 -A. 28
