The bill establishes an excise tax of 1 ¢ per 25 gallons of groundwater extracted from springs or other underground 
sources by operators that extracted more than 1 million gallons in the previous calendar year, beginning on October 1, 
2017. The revenue from this excise tax is transferred to the Maine Water Quality Testing and Monitoring Fund 
(MWQTMF) within the Depattment of Environmental Protection (DEP). The newly established fund will be used to 
provide grants to public and private entities for testing wells and other drinking water sources for heavy metals, 
bacteria and other contaminants, for a lake water quality monitoring and support program and for well water 
remediation services. It is estimated that the excise tax will generate $216,000 in General Fund revenue for transfer to 
the MWQTMF in fiscal year 2017-18 and $360,000 annually thereafter. Up to 10% of the revenue transferred into the 
fund may be used by the DEP for development and administration of the program. 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations to the DEP of $16, 791 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $19,588 in fiscal 
year 2018-19 and allocations to the MWQTMF of $14,291 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $19,5 88 in fiscal year 2018-9 
for one patt-time Environmental Specialist Ill position to administer the grant program, the lake water quality 
monitoring and support program and the well water remediation program. The bill also includes allocations to the 
MWQTMF of $201, 709 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $340,412 in fiscal year 2018-19 for administrative costs of the 
department, grants to public or private entities involved in well water testing programs, a contract with a private 
organization to monitor and supp01t lake water quality and well water remediation services.
