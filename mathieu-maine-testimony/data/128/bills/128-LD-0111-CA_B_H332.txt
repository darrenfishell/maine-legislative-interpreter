24 This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
25 This amendment replaces the bill, which requires the establishment of a veterans 
26 treatment court in Androscoggin County. Instead, this amendment relies on the enabling 
27 language already in statute for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court to establish 
28 veterans treatment courts where appropriate and provides the funding for the courts as 
29 well as for the services to be provided for the 2018-2019 biennium only.

This bill includes one-time General Fund appropriations of $10,800 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $14,400 in fiscal year 
2018-19 for the Judicial Department to establish a Veterans Court. The Gbvemor's biennial budget for the 2018-2019 
biennium, LD 390, provides funding to increase the rate paid to Active Retired Judges. This estimate of fiscal impact 
may need to be revised based on final Legislative action on the biennial budget. 
The bill also includes one-time General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$125,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $125,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 for case management services provided by the 
Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services for a veteran's treatment program.
