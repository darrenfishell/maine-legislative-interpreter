for 2 Senior Revenue Agent positions and related costs to review and process sales tax collection allowances. The 
establishment of a sales tax collection allowance will reduce General Fund revenues by $588,000 in fiscal year 2017-
18 and $815,360 in fiscal year 2018-19 and Local Government Fund revenues by $12,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 
$16,640 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
General Fund and Local Government Fund revenue would be increased if a person were to voluntarily collect and 
remit sales and use tax under this legislation or if the court were to lift any potential injunction filed against the state.
