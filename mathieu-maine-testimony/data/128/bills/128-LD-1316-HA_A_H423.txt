This amendment directs the Department of Marine Resources to annually issue one elver exporter's license to the 
Houlton Band ofMaliseet Indians at no cost. This is in addition to the elver dealer's license required by the original 
bill. Since the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has not purchased an elver exporter's license in the past, there is no 
anticipated revenue loss from this directive.
