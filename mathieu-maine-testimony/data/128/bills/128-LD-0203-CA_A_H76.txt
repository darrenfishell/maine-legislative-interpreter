referendum question asking voters to choose if the State should seek placement in the 
Atlantic Standard Time Zone and opt out of observing daylight saving time. 
3. It provides that if the referendum question is approved, the Secretary of State is 
required to request that the United States Secretary of Transportation place the State in
