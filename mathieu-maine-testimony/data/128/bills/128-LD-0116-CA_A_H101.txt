General Fund revenue of $839,429 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $836,371 in fiscal year 2018-19 and an increase in 
Local Government Fund revenue of $17,131 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $34,200 in fiscal year 2018-19. Under current 
law the General Fund revenue collected in one year is transferred the following year to the Multimodal Transportation

$839,429 in fiscal year 2018-19. The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $839,429 in fiscal 
year 2018-19 to the Department of Transportation .
