Fiscal Note 
Potential conflict with worksharing agreements 
This amendment establishes a filing fee for complaints filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission. The 
commission has indicated that such a fee is specifically prohibited in the commission's worksharing agreements with 
the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Equal Opportunity Commission. The 
commission also indicates that the estimated $150,000 that could be generated annually from the new fees would be 
dwarfed by the 45% of the commission's annual revenue that would be immediately terminated because of the 
violation of aggreements.
