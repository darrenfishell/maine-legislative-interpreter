The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill provides a property tax exemption to veterans at least 62 years of age who have served on active duty or have 
qualifying disabilities. The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $15,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services to reimburse municipalities for administrative costs associated 
with implementing this property tax exemption. General Fund appropriations would need to be provided beginning in 
fiscal year 2019-20 to reimburse municipalities for 100% of the exemption.
