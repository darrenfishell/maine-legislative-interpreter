Current biennium cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Any additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) from requiring a visual impact assessment 
(VIA) from an expedited wind energy development located within 8 miles of a scenic resource of state or national 
significance are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The requirement 
that any rules enacted with regard to expedited wind pennitting be defined as major substantive rules will increase 
DEP rnlemaking costs.
