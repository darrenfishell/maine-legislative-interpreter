SUMMARY  8 
This bill establishes the Local Infrastructure Fund and the Local Infrastructure 9 
Matching Grant Program, whic h is administered by the Department of Transportation to 10 
provide matching grants to a municipality that undertakes a project in that municipality to 11 
maintain, improve or construct roads or bridges.  The fund is funded by continuing the 12 
temporary reduction of transfers to the Local Government Fund, so -called state -municipal 13 
revenue sharing, at 2% instead of 5% and requiring the other 3% of the revenue from 14 
taxes imposed on sales and income to be deposited in the Local Infrastructure Fund.  The 15 
formula for de termining the limit of a grant to a municipality is the same as the formula 16 
used to determine the distribution to a municipality from the Local Government Fund. 17 
The effect of this is to allow a municipality to receive 5% in revenue sharing, depending 18 
on th e size of the infrastructure project undertaken by that municipality.  19
