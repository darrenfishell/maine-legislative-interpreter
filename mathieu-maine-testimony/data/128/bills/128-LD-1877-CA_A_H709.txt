SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "ft,, to H.P. 1309, L.D. 1877, Bill, "An Act To 
Expand the Areas Subject to Municipal Residency Restrictions for Sex Offenders" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Expand and Clarify the Areas Subject.to Municipal Residency 
Restrictions for Sex Offenders' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §3014, sub-§2, ,rB, as amended by PL 2013, c. 161, §1, is 
repealed and the following enacted in its place: 
B. A municipality may prohibit residence by a sex offender up to a maximum 
distance of 750 feet surrounding the real property comprising: 
(1) A public or private elementary, middle or secondary school; 
(2) A municipally owned or state-owned park, athletic field or recreational 
facility that is open to the public where children are the primary users; or 
(3) A municipally owned or state-owned property leased to a nonprofit 
organization for purposes of a park athletic field or recreational facility that is 
open to the public where children are the primary users.' 
SUMMARY 
When the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 30-A, section 3014, subsection 2, paragraph 
B was amended in 2013, the legislation inadvertently omitted the ability of a 
municipality, by ordinance, to prohibit a sex offender from residing within 750 feet of 
property comprising a municipally owned or state-owned park, athletic field or 
recreational facility that is open to the public where children are the primary users; the 
exclusion was permitted only if that municipally owned or state-owned property was 
leased to a nonprofit organization.
