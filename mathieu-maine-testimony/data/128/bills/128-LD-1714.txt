Page 1 - 128LR2762(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Department  of Health and Human Services  amended its rules 
4 governing the MaineCare program to provide  that anyone  with a direct  or indirect 
5 "ownership interest" of any size in a MaineCare provider,  and every officer, director or 
6 member of a MaineCare provider,  is personally liable for the provider's  debts owed to the 
7 department; and
8 Whereas, the rule amendment contravenes  a foundational principle of our political  
9 and economic  system assuring that a provider organization's members, directors and, if 
10 applicable, shareholders are protected from the organization's liabilities  except in 
11 extraordinary circumstances; and
12 Whereas, the imposition of personal liability  for a provider organization's debts on 
13 employees, officers,  directors,  members and shareholders will disruptively alter 
14 established insurance risks, financial arrangements  and investor and creditor expectations 
15 and may deter qualified persons from serving  in positions of trust or responsibility in 
16 nonprofit or  for-profit organizations that deliver  health care to Maine people; and
17 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
18 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
19 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
20 therefore,
21 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
22 Sec. 1.  22 MRSA  §1714-A, sub-§5, as amended by PL 2003, c. 419, §5, is 
23 further amended  to read:
24 5.  Department  may offset.   The department may offset  against current 
25 reimbursement owed to a provider  or any entity  related by ownership  or control  to that 
26 provider any debt it is owed by that provider after the debt becomes collectible.  The 
27 department shall adopt  rules  that implement  this subsection and define the ownership or 
28 control relationships that are subject to an offset under this subsection , except that the 
29 department may not define  any ownership or control relationship  as subject to an offset 
30 unless the relationship allows  the person whose  relationship is the subject  of the offset to 
31 control at least the number  of votes of the provider's  governing body or management that 
32 is needed to govern the operations of the provider.  Rules  adopted pursuant  to this 
33 subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title  5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
34 Sec. 2.  22 MRSA  §1714-A,  sub-§10  is enacted  to read:
35 10.  No imposition of liability on other persons.   The department may not by any 
36 means, including without limitation any rule or any contract or agreement with a 
37 provider, impose liability  for a debt under this section on any person  other  than the 
38 provider notified of the debt pursuant to subsection  2 or a person subject  to collection by 
39 offset pursuant  to rules  adopted  under subsection 5.  This subsection  does not prohibit the 
Page 2 - 128LR2762(01)-11 department from seeking  recovery of civil penalties from any person as provided in 
2 section 15.
3 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
4 legislation takes effect when  approved.
5 SUMMARY
6 This bill clarifies  requirements for the definition of an ownership or control  
7 relationship for purposes  of determining  when the Department of Health  and Human 
8 Services may offset  debts owed to the department by a provider against current 
9 MaineCare reimbursement  due to that provider or an entity  related to that provider.  It 
10 clarifies that the department may not offset current reimbursement owed  to an entity 
11 related by ownership or control to the provider unless the person whose relationship  is the 
12 subject of the offset has the voting power to govern  the operation of the provider owing 
13 the debt.  The bill prohibits the department  from imposing liability  for a debt owed by a 
14 provider on any person  except a provider notified  in accordance with statute of the debt 
15 or a person  subject to collection  by offset.   The bill retains the provision in current  law 
16 allowing the department to recover  a debt by seeking a  civil penalty  for a  false claim.
