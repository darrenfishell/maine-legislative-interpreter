 SUMMARY  1 
This bill updates the charter provisions for state -chartered credit unions in the 2 
following ways:  3 
1.  Putting state -chartered credit unions in line with their federally chartered 4 
counterparts by repealing the guaranty fund requirements and allowing dividend 5 
payments  when the credit union establishes and maintains adequate levels of net worth.  6 
Currently, state -chartered credit unions must have a percentage of gross income set aside 7 
before there may be a dividend payment to a member.  The bill directs the Superintende nt 8 
of Financial Institutions to adopt rules regarding the composition of net worth, the levels 9 
that must be maintained and procedures that must be followed to restore net worth if it 10 
falls below the minimum standard to continue to safeguard credit union me mbers;  11 
2.  To ensure safe and smooth day -to-day operations of state -chartered credit unions 12 
and consistent with the trend followed by credit unions in other states, allowing the 13 
manager or chief executive officer of a credit union, rather than the board of  directors, to 14 
expel a member for certain types of conduct.  The expelled member must be informed of 15 
the grounds for the expulsion and may appeal the expulsion;  16 
3.  Increasing the percentage of total surplus that state -chartered credit unions may 17 
invest in  real estate and fixed assets from 50% to 60%; and  18 
4.  To bring Maine's state charter in line with its federal counterpart, directing the 19 
superintendent to consider federal laws and regulations when determining whether a new 20 
credit union service corporatio n primarily serves a credit union or credit union members 21 
and removing a general reference to a statutory provision that in itself is not specific to 22 
credit unions and instead incorporating language from that provision that requires credit 23 
unions to notify  the superintendent in writing 10 days prior to organizing as or investing 24 
in a credit union service corporation and vesting the superintendent with the power to 25 
prescribe the manner and form of the credit union service corporation's books and 26 
accounts.  27
