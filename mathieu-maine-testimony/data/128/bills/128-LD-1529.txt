SUMMARY  20 
This bill amends the laws governing home construction contrac ts in the following 21 
ways.  22 
1.  It increases the threshold upon which a written home construction contract is 23 
required from $3,000 to $5,000.  24 
2.  It repeals the provision in current law that allows homeowners or lessees and 25 
home construction contractors to e xempt themselves from the home construction contract 26 
requirements by mutual consent.  27 
3.  It requires a home construction contractor to deposit funds received from a home 28 
construction contract into a business account that is separate from any account used f or 29 
personal use by the contractor. A home construction contractor who violates this 30 
requirement commits a misapplication of home construction funds, a new Class E crime 31 
established by the bill, which also subjects the contractor to the escrow requirements 32 
established by the bill and a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000.  33 
4.  If a home construction contractor has been convicted of misapplication of home 34 
construction funds or home repair fraud in the State, or any similar crime in another 35 
jurisdic tion, the bill requires the contractor to put funds received in an escrow account or 36 
obtain an indemnity contract or surety bond.  A person who violates these requirements is 37 
subject to a civil violation that carries a fine of not less than $100 nor more t han $1,000.  38 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR1649(01) -1 
 A person who violates these requirements and causes a homeowner or lessee to suffer a 1 
financial loss that is more than $1,000 but not more than $10,000 commits a Class D 2 
crime and commits a Class C crime when that financial loss is more than $ 10,000.  3
