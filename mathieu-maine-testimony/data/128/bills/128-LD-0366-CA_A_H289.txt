COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITIEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 272, L.D. 366 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
3 It deletes the provisions of the bill authorizing law enforcement agencies to transport 
4 aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States to a federal facility and creating 
5 private rights of action. It removes from the complaint process the provision that a 
6 government entity is ineligible to receive state funds if the Attorney General determines 
7 the entity is in violation of the provisions concerning the sharing and use of immigration 
8 and citizenship information or restricting the enforcement of federal immigration law. 
9 The amendment also provides that if the Attorney General, upon investigation, 
10 determines that a government entity is violating the law, the Attorney General must issue 
11 an opinion stating that finding. The government entity has 30 days to appeal the finding 
12 to the Superior Comt. If the Superior Court agrees with the Attorney General, the court 
13 must immediately enjoin the policy or practice. Each day the government entity 
14 continues the policy or practice results in a $500 fine. If the Superior Court disagrees 
15 with the Attorney General, the Attorney General must immediately certify that the 
16 government entity is in compliance with the law.
