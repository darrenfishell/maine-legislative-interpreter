This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment repeals the provision of law that 
prohibits a person who has been issued a learner's permit from operating a motor vehicle 
while using a handheld electronic device or mobile telephone. The amendment repeals 
the section of law that prohibits minors from operating a motor vehicle while using a 
handheld electronic device and mobile telephone. The amendment also repeals the 
section of law that prohibits any person from operating a motor vehicle while engaging in 
text messaging. 
The amendment incorporates the definition of "mobile telephone" into the definition 
of "handheld electronic device." The amendment excludes text messaging from the 
definition of "using" to reflect the different penalties for using a handheld electronic 
device and for text messaging while operating a motor vehicle. 
Like the bill, the amendment expands the prohibition on minors and a person who has 
been issued a learner's permit operating a motor vehicle while using a handheld electronic
