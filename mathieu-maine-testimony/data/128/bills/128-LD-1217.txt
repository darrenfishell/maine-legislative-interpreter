SUMMARY  30 
This bill implements changes in the efficiency and effectiveness of statutorily 31 
required independent evaluations of research and development activities and economic 32 
development incentives that are the responsibility of the Department of Economic and 33 
Communi ty Development. The Government Oversight Committee identified these 34 
changes in its ongoing follow -up of the recommendations included in the Office of 35 
Program Evaluation and Government Accountability's 2006 report on economic 36 
development programs in Maine. Current law requires the department to conduct an 37 
independent evaluation of research and development activities and a separate evaluation 38 
of economic development incentives that are not covered in the research and development 39 
evaluation. Since the primary purpose of research and development activities is to support 40 
economic development, this bill combines the statutory provisions related to both these 41 
evaluations into a requirement for conducting and funding one independent evaluation 42 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR2258 (01)-1 
 that encompasses both.  The bill also changes the required cycle for evaluation from every 1 
2 years, with results reported to the Legislature during second regular sessions, to every 4 2 
years, with results reported during first regular sessions. This is intended to allow the 3 
Legis lature more time to consider the recommendations from evaluation reports and 4 
allow for recommendations to be implemented in between evaluation periods. 5 
Additionally, this bill establishes the objectives for the evaluation and ties those 6 
objectives and any recommendations made to the State's long -term economic plan 7 
developed by the Maine Economic Growth Council pursuant to the Maine Revised 8 
Statutes, Title 10, section 929 -A, subsection 1. There is currently a separate bill, 9 
Legislative Document 367, before t he 128th Legislature addressing the Maine Economic 10 
Growth Council's responsibilities for that plan. Lastly, this bill seeks to ensure that 11 
evaluation results are considered and acted on, as appropriate, by assigning responsibility 12 
for review and action to both the Department of Economic and Community Development 13 
and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor, 14 
commerce, research and economic development matters.  15
