The rules must be based on the particular operational requirements of each activity, the 
most recently adopted federal sanitation standards and the most recent generally accepted 
research data, in a manner so as to protect the public health and safety while allowing 
reasonable use of the State's shellfish and whole scallops. 
5. Right of entry. Whenever a certificate has been issued under this section, the 
commissioner, or the commissioner's agent, must have access to any establishment or part 
thereof for the purpose of inspection or collection of samples. Denial of access is 
grounds for suspension or revocation of any certificate or license under the provisions of 
section 63 72. 
6. Products embargoed and condemned. The commissioner, or the 
commissioner's agent, shall indefinitely embargo, condemn or order to be destroyed any 
shellfish, shellfish product or whole scallop in any establishment whenever it is 
determined that the product is of unsound quality, contains any filthy, decomposed or 
putrid substance, or may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe. The 
commissioner and the commissioner's agent shall cooperate with those state and federal 
agencies having similar responsibility in the protection of public health and in enforcing 
the order to embargo, condemn or destroy. 
In the event that any shellfish, shellfish product or whole scallop in any establishment is 
embargoed, condemned or ordered destroyed, the commissioner, or the commissioner's 
agent, shall, as soon thereafter as practical, notify the owner in writing of the amount and 
kind of shellfish, shellfish product or whole scallop embargoed, condemned or destroyed. 
9. Disposition of fees. The commissioner shall deposit fees collected under this 
section in the Shellfish Fund under section 6651. 
Sec. 3. Effective date. That section of this Act that amends the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 12, section 6852, subsection 4 takes effect April 1, 2018.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The bill establishes a fee of $50 for a shellfish 
sanitation certificate and establishes additional permits for authorized activities under a 
shellfish sanitation certificate. The permits established are a recirculating wet storage 
permit, a flow-through wet storage permit, a bulk tagging permit and a shellfish buying 
station permit. A recirculating wet storage permit is $200, unless the holder provides 
weekly test results showing compliance with federal sanitation standards, in which case 
the fee is $100; a flow-through wet storage permit is $100; a bulk tagging permit is $50; 
and a shellfish buying station permit is $100. The amendment increases the fee for a retail 
seafood license from $28 to $100. The amendment establishes a fee of $200 for a 
depuration certificate. Like the bill, the amendment requires the fees collected to be 
deposited in the Shellfish Fund. The amendment provides specified dates on which the 
Department of Marine Resources may begin assessing fees established in the amendment.
