 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the provisions of the citizen -initiated legislation, Legislative Document 3 
1701, An Act to Legalize Marijuana, were approved by majority vote in the November 8, 4 
2016 General Election; and  5 
Whereas, Public Law 2017, chapter 1, which was enacted by the 128th Legislature 6 
and signed into law on January 27, 2017, delays the implementation of the retai l sales 7 
portion of the Marijuana Legalization Act until February 1, 2018 but did not change the 8 
ability of persons over 21 years of age to cultivate and possess marijuana for personal 9 
use; 10 
Whereas, the lack of safe, regulated establishments for individuals  over 21 years of 11 
age to legally purchase marijuana during this time will encourage black market activity 12 
which could result in an increase in access to marijuana by individuals under 21 years of 13 
age; and  14 
Whereas, certain measures to discourage minors from  using marijuana illegally, to 15 
further clarify the provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act and to create a revenue 16 
stream to aid in the enforcement activities for deterring black market sales of marijuana 17 
need to be implemented as soon as possible; an d 18 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 19 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 20 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 21 
therefore,  22

SUMMARY  21 
This bill provides clarifications to the Marijuana Legalization Act, as approved at 22 
referendum in November 2016, as follows:  23 
1.  It specifies that, for purposes of the Marijuana Legalization Act, a minor is a 24 
person who is under 21 years of age.  The bill prohibits the possession, purchase and 25 
transportation of marijuana by minors, and the furnishing of marijuana to minors, except 26 
when permitted under the Maine Medic al Use of Marijuana Act and in other certain 27 
circumstances.  The prohibitions in this bill are modeled on the statutes prohibiting the 28 
possession, purchase and transportation of alcohol by minors;  29 
2.  It specifies that the state licensing authority is the Department of Administrative 30 
and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations;  31 
3.  It allows for the limited sale of adult use marijuana while the bureau begins the 32 
rule-making process and issuing licenses for retail marijuana e stablishments pursuant to 33 
those rules by allowing medical marijuana dispensaries to sell limited marijuana retail 34 
products to persons 21 years of age or older in accordance with certain conditions.  These 35 
early sales begin on the effective date of this bil l and end December 31, 2018 unless the 36 
bureau has not yet begun issuing licenses for retail marijuana establishments.  In that 37 
case, medical marijuana dispensaries can continue to sell limited marijuana retail 38 
products until the bureau begins, through fina l agency action, to issue licenses for retail 39 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR1608(01) -1 
 marijuana establishments.  It allows dispensaries to purchase prepared marijuana and 1 
marijuana products from registered primary caregivers for purposes of distribution to 2 
persons 21 years of age and older.  It imposes a marijuana tax of 10% of the sale price of 3 
limited marijuana retail products.  It allocates 10% of the tax revenue to the host 4 
community where the dispensary is located, 45% of the special tax revenue to the 5 
Department of Health and Human Services  to fund regulatory oversight and enforcement 6 
of sales of limited marijuana retail products as well as efforts by the department to deter 7 
use of marijuana by persons under 21 years of age and the remaining 45% to the 8 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation  and Forestry or the bureau to fund 9 
administration, regulatory development and enforcement of the Marijuana Legalization 10 
Act. It also imposes state sales tax on limited marijuana retail products; and  11 
4.  It imposes a cap on the issuance of primary caregive r registry identification cards.  12
