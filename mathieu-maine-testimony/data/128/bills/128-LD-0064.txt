SUMMARY  32 
This bill makes several changes to the foreclosure mediation program.  33 
First, it makes the mediation program mand atory for all parties when a plaintiff 34 
commences an action for the foreclosure of an owner -occupied residential property of no 35 
more than 4 units that is the primary residence of the owner -occupant.  36 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0630(01) -1 
 Second, it requires the mediation to start not more than 9 0 days after the defendant 1 
receives the foreclosure complaint.  The bill requires the plaintiff to notify the Supreme 2 
Judicial Court when the defendant has received the complaint, at which time the court 3 
will refer the parties to mediation.  The court is r equired to notify the parties of the 4 
referral to mediation, and the mediation must then be scheduled to begin within 90 days 5 
from the date the complaint was received by the defendant.  6 
Third, the bill requires the cost of mediation to be paid equally by the  plaintiff and the 7 
defendant.  Currently, the plaintiff pays for mediation services.  8 
Fourth, the bill eliminates the requirement that the attorneys for the plaintiff and the 9 
defendant, if the defendant is represented, attend the mediation.  A party's attor ney may 10 
attend mediation, and an attorney in attendance is required to mediate in good faith and is 11 
subject to appropriate sanctions for failing to mediate in good faith.  12
