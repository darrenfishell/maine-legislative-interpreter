SUMMARY  14 
This bill ena cts the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act as the 15 
Maine Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, Article 10 in the Maine 16 
Revised Statutes, Title 18 -A. 17 
The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approve d the 18 
Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act in July 2015.  19 
The Prefatory Note and accompanying comments to the Maine Revised Uniform 20 
Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act provide a summary and explanation of the 21 
Revised Uniform Fiduciary A ccess to Digital Assets Act.  The Revised Uniform 22 
Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act provides an important update for the Internet age.  23 
A generation ago, files were stored in cabinets, photos were stored in albums and mail 24 
was delivered by a human bei ng.  Today, people are more likely to use the Internet to 25 
communicate and store information.  The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital 26 
Assets Act ensures users retain control of their digital property and can plan for its 27 
ultimate disposition after their death but also takes into account the digital privacy that 28 
users and those with whom they communicate have a right to expect under federal law 29 
and the unique authentication issues inherent in a paperless record -keeping system.  30 
Unless the user instru cts otherwise, legally appointed fiduciaries will have the same 31 
access to digital assets as they have always had to tangible assets and the same duty to 32 
comply with the user's instructions.  33 
This bill modifies the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital  Assets Act to be 34 
consistent with existing Maine law with regard to conservators.  35

Section 9 of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, included in this 4 
bill as the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18 -A, section 10 -109. 5 
Part C provides that th e provisions of this bill take effect January 1, 2018.  6
