Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA ยง3111 is enacted to read: 
ยง3111. Recovering costs of opioid antagonists 
1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
following terms have the following meanings. 
A. "Health insurance" has the same meaning as in Title 24-A, section 704. 
B. "Opioid antagonist" means naloxone hydrochloride or other similarly acting drug 
that is approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of an 
opioid overdose. 
C. "Opioid-related drug overdose" has the same meaning as in Title 22, section 2353, 
subsection 1, paragraph C. 
2. Reimbursement. When a municipality or county or an agent of either 
administers an opioid antagonist to an individual experiencing an opioid-related drug 
overdose, the municipality or county or agent may make all reasonable efforts to identify 
whether that individual has previously been administered an opioid antagonist. The 
municipality or county or agent may make all reasonable efforts to recover from the 
individual's health insurance provider the cost of the dose administered if it is not the first 
opioid antagonist administered to the individual.'

11 ~ COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1074, L.D. 1558 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment removes 
the requirement in the bill that a municipality or county or agent of either make all 
reasonable efforts to identify whether an individual has previously been administered an 
opioid antagonist and to recover the cost from the individual if it is a 2nd or subsequent 
treatment. The amendment, instead, authorizes a municipality, county or agent to make 
efforts to identify prior treatment with an opioid antagonist, and it authorizes the 
municipality or county to make efforts to recover from the individual's health insurance 
provider the cost of the dose administered if it is a 2nd or subsequent treatment. The 
amendment removes the provision in the bill that imposes a $1,000 fine on a municipality 
or county that does not meet the bill's requirements.
