application for such a permit is submitted by an individual, the de12artment may not object 
to the issuance of the permit pursuant to 7 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 3 60 .3 04

referred to as water spinach, and then approve the application. The amendment clarifies 
that the State is prohibited from objecting to the issuance of a federal pe1mit as long as
