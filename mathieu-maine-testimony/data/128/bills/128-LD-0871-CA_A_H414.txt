Accessible by a Public Way and Any Means Other than a Public Way' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 3 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 3. 33 MRSA ยง173, sub-ยง6 is enacted to read: 
6. Access to the property. Information describing the means of accessing the 
property by: 
A. A public way, as defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 59; and 
B. Any means other than a public way, in which case the seller shall disclose 
information about who is responsible for maintenance of the means of access, 
including any responsible road association. if known by the seller.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment requires the disclosure in the sale of residential property of 
information regarding the means of accessing the property. The amendment revises the 
disclosure to a declaration of how the property is accessible: by a public way as well as 
by any means other than a public way. If the property is accessible by means other than a 
public way, whether as the only means of access or in addition to access via a public way, 
the owner is required to disclose information about who is responsible for maintenance of 
the means of the non-public way access, including any responsible road association, if 
known. The disclosure will put the prospective buyer on notice that access to the 
property may be limited and that there is a possibility that the property is subject to 
membership in a road association, which may require the payment of assessments. The 
amendment changes the title.
