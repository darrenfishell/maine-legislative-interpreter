Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Allowing former employees covered by either the State Employees and Teachers Retirement program or the 
Participating Local Districts program that are currently not eligible for disability retirement benefits under the Maine 
Public Employees Retirement System to be eligible if very specific criteria are met may result in increased plan costs 
in the future as a result of higher disability benefits being paid. The actual cost can not be determined at this time and 
will depend on the actual individuals who may become eligible for benefits in the future because of this legislation.
