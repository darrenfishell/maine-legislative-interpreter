 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to streamline the process for moving teachers and administrators 5 
from provisional certification to professional certification by including in that 6 
certification process elements of the locally adopted and state -approved evaluation 7 
system conducted by supervisory personnel that is used to evaluate and improve teacher 8 
and administrator performance.  Th e local support system that includes the pairing of 9 
mentors with mentees and is commonly known as the professional learning community 10 
support system must remain distinctly separate from any evaluation by supervisory 11 
personnel.  12
