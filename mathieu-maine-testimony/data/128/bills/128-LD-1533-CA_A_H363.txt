SUMMARY 
This amendment requires the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to establish a process by which an 
existing agency liquor store in the same municipality to which another agency liquor 
store is applying to relocate may submit support of or objections to the bureau regarding 
the relocation. The bill proposes to eliminate from the criteria for issuance of a new 
agency liquor store license that the applicant be licensed to sell beer and wine for at least 
one year prior to application and that the applicant was not found to have violated any 
provision of that license. The amendment provides that an applicant is not required to 
have been previously licensed to sell beer and wine, but that if the applicant was licensed 
to conduct those sales the applicant did so without a violation of law. The amendment 
adds a requirement that the applicant demonstrate that the applicant will act as a 
responsible licensee. The amendment also changes the laws regarding mobile service 
bars at golf courses and disc golf courses, reflecting changes made in Public Law 2017, 
chapter 17.
