paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 33

SUMMARY  35 
Part A specifies that holding land primarily for conservation or public access 36 
purposes is not a benevolent and charitable purpose, which is a condition necessary to 37 
obtaining an exemption from property tax.  This Part allows a land t rust organization to 38 
enroll land owned by it in the open space tax law program, which would provide up to a 39 
95% reduction in the assessed value of that land as long as certain conditions are met.  40 
This Part also removes the 15,000 -acre limit on the size of  land that may be enrolled in 41 
the open space tax law program.  42 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0729(01) -1 
 Part B expands the authorization for municipal assessment of service charges for 1 
certain municipal costs against certain property exempt from property tax to remove the 2 
exemption for student hou sing and parsonages and to remove the limit on application of 3 
the charge to residential property used for rental income.  The service charges may be 4 
levied only against an owner that has total real estate assets in the municipality with an 5 
assessed value o f $10,000,000 or more.  The existing cap of 2% of the gross annual 6 
revenues of the institution or organization is retained.  7 
Part C reduces the rate of the excise tax imposed on motor vehicles for the first and 8 
2nd year from 24 mills to 18 mills and 17 1/2  to 16 mills, respectively; and increases the 9 
excise tax for the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th year from 13 1/2 mills to 14 mills, 10 mills to 11.5 10 
mills, 6 1/2 mills to 10 mills and 4 mills to 6 mills, respectively.  After the 6th year, the 11 
mill rate reverts to 4  mills.  12
