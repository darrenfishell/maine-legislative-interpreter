Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue decrease -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This legislation requires that any funds received on behalf of the Saxl Park Advisory Committee be held in an interest­
bearing account and any interest on balances in the account be credited back to the same purpose. This would result 
in a minor decrease in General Fund revenue and an increase in dedicated revenue not requiring any change to the 
budget. Any additional costs to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services are expected to be minor 
and can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted resources.
