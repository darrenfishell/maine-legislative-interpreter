2.  Presumption.   If a firefighter who contracts cancer has met the requirements of 4 
subsections 3, 6 and  7, there is a rebuttable  conclusive  presumption that the firefighter 5 
contracted the cancer in the course of employment as a firefighter and as a result of that 6 
employment, that sufficient notice of the cancer has been given and that the disease was 7 
not oc casioned by any willful act of the firefighter to cause the disease.  8 
SUMMARY  9 
Under current law, there is a rebuttable presumption that if a firefighter meeting 10 
certain requirements contracts cancer, the cancer was contracted in the course of that 11 
employmen t and as a result of that employment.  This bill amends that provision of law to 12 
establish the presumption as conclusive, rather than rebuttable.  13
