Regarding Large-scale Community Solar Procurement" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:

Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3209-A, as corrected by RR 2017, c. 1, §32, is amended to 
read: 
§3209-A. Net energy billing 
The commission may adopt or amend rules governing net energy billing. Rules 
adopted or amended under this section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice 
under which a customer is billed on the basis of net energy over the billing period taking 
into account accumulated unused kilowatt-hour credits from the previous billing period. 
1. Billing based on gross output prohibited. A customer may not be required to 
meter the gross output of a facility used for net energy billing purposes in order to 
participate in net energy billing. Net energy for a net energy billing customer must be 
calculated based on the difference between the ldlowatt-hours delivered by a transmission 
and distribution utility to that customer over a single billing period and the kilowatt-hours 
exported by that customer to the transmission and distribution utility over that same 
billing period, taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt-hour credits from the 
previous billing period. For the purposes of this subsection, "gross output" means all of 
the energy generated by a facility used by a net energy billing customer for net energy 
billing purposes during an applicable period, including all energy that is used to offset the 
usage of that customer. 
2. Shared interest. In the service territory of an investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utility, the number of net energy billing customers that participate in net

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 499, L.D. 1444 
1 energy billing through a shared interest or the number of meters associated with a shared 
2 interest may not exceed 50. For the purposes of this subsection, "shared interest" means 
3 an interest in a facility used for net energy billing purposes shared by multiple net energy 
4 billing customers that have distinct billing accounts with an investor-owned transmission 
5 and distribution utility. 
6 This subsection is repealed July 1, 2020. 
7 Sec. 2. Rules. The Public Utilities Commission shall amend its net energy billing 
8 rules by October 1, 2018 to conform with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 
9 3209-A, subsections 1 and 2. The commission may not make any other changes to rules 
10 adopted pursuant to Title 35-A, section 3209-A except as required by this section until 
11 July 1, 2020.' 
12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment is the majority report of the committee, and it replaces the bill and 
14 changes the title. It prohibits a transmission and distribution utility from requiring a 
15 customer to meter the gross output of a facility used for net energy billing purposes in 
16 order to participate in net energy billing. It specifies that net energy is calculated based 
17 on the difference between the kilowatt-hours delivered by a transmission and distribution 
18 utility to a customer over a single billing period and the kilowatt-hours exported by that 
19 customer to the transmission and distribution utility over the same billing period, taking 
20 into account unused kilowatt-hour credits. In the service territory of an investor-owned 
21 transmission and distribution utility, it limits the number of net energy billing customers 
22 that may participate in net energy billing through a shared interest or the number of 
23 meters associated with a shared interest to 50 until July 1, 2020. It requires the Public 
24 Utilities Commission to amend its net energy billing rules by October 1, 2018 to conform 
25 with these provisions. It prohibits the commission from making any other changes to its 
26 net energy billing rules until July 1, 2020.
