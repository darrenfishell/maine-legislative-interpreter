the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Education and 33 
the Commissioner of Labor as well as the Treasurer of State, the President of the Senate 34 
and the Speaker of the H ouse of Representatives.  Base funding for universal child care is 35

the federal Child Care and Development Fund block grant.  37

Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services is directed to develop 39
