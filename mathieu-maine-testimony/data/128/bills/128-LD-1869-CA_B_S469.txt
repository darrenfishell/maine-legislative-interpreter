Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the allocations for funding the total cost of K-12 public education in 2018-2019 including the 
state contribution of $1, 115,378,083. Because General Fund appropriations and Other Special Revenue Funds

provided in Public Law 2017, c. 284, the 2018-2019 biennial budget, no additional funding is required.
