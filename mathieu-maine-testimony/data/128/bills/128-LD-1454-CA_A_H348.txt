Fiscal Note 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
This bill modifies the criteria that allows a person who has been denied a limited entry fishing license as a result of 
their military service's impact on eligibility requirements to seek a waiver from the Department of Marine Resources. 
Because these waivers will allow more licenses to be issued to a limited number of individuals who previously were 
unable to qualify for a license, there may be a minor increase to General Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds 
revenue.
