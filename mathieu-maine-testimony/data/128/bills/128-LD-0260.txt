4.  Triennial plan.   The board shall vote on a detailed, triennial, energy efficiency, 6 
alternative energy resources and conservation plan that includes the quantifiable measures 7 
of performance developed under subsection 3 and make a full report of the vote to the 8 
commission in accordance with this subsection.  The triennial plan must provide 9 
integrated planning, program design and implementation strategies for all energy 10 
efficiency, alternative energy resources and conservation programs administered  by the 11 
trust, including but not limited to the electric efficiency and conservation programs under 12 
section 10110, the natural gas efficiency and conservation programs under section 10111, 13 
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 101 09, the Heating 14 
Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund under section 10119 and any state or federal 15 
funds or publicly directed funds accepted by or allocated to the trust for the purposes of 16 
this chapter.  The triennial plan must include provisions for t he application of appropriate 17 
program funds to support workforce development efforts that are consistent with and 18 
promote the purposes of the trust.  Beginning January 1, 2011, the triennial plan must 19 
specify the appropriate participation of the State in n ational and regional carbon markets.  20 
The plan must be consistent with the comprehensive state energy plan pursuant to Title 2,  21 
section 9 10205 , subsection 3, paragraph C  2. 22 
A.  The triennial plan must be developed by the trust, in consultation with entiti es and 23 
agencies engaged in delivering efficiency programs in the State, to authorize and 24 
govern or coordinate implementation of energy efficiency and weatherization 25 
programs in the State.  The triennial plan must identify all achievable cost -effective 26 
energy efficiency savings and related programs that could be implemented pursuant 27 
to sections 10110 and 10111, the costs and benefits of such programs and the basis 28 
and support for such identified costs and benefits.  The trust shall conduct an 29 
evaluation of a ll cost -effective potential for electrical and natural gas energy 30 
efficiency savings in the State at least once every 5 years.  31 
(1)  Transmission and distribution utilities and natural gas utilities shall furnish 32 
data to the trust that the trust requests un der this subsection to develop and 33 
implement the triennial plan or conduct the evaluation of all cost -effective 34 
potential for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency savings subject to such 35 
confidential treatment as a utility may request and the board  determines 36 
appropriate pursuant to section 10106.  The costs of providing the data are 37 
deemed reasonable and prudent expenses of the utilities and are recoverable in 38 
rates.  39 
B.  In developing the triennial plan, the staff of the trust shall consult the boa rd and 40 
provide the opportunity for the board to provide input on drafts of the plan.  41 
B-1.  In developing the triennial plan, the trust shall provide the joint standing 42 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters an opportunity 43 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1211(01) -1 
 to provide input on the plan, which may occur at the same time the trust consults with 1 
other entities in the development of the plan.  2 
C.  The board shall review and approve the triennial plan by affirmative vote of 2/3 of 3 
the trustees upon a finding that the p lan is consistent with the statutory authority for 4 
each source of funds that will be used to implement the plan, advances the state 5 
energy efficiency targets in paragraph F and reflects the best practices of program 6 
administration under subsection 2.  The plan must include, but is not limited to, 7 
efficiency and conservation program budget allocations, objectives, targets, measures 8 
of performance, program designs, program implementation strategies, timelines and 9 
other relevant information.  10 
D.  Prior to submi ssion of the triennial plan to the commission, the trust shall offer to 11 
provide a detailed briefing on the draft plan to the joint standing committee of the 12 
Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters and, at the request of the 13 
committee, shall pro vide such a briefing and opportunity for input from the 14 
committee.  After providing such opportunity for input and making any changes as a 15 
result of any input received, the board shall deliver the plan to the commission for its 16 
review and approval.  The co mmission shall open an adjudicatory proceeding and 17 
issue an order either approving the plan and issuing the appropriate orders to 18 
transmission and distribution utilities and gas utilities or rejecting the plan and stating 19 
the reasons for the rejection.  Th e commission shall reject elements of the plan that 20 
propose to use funds generated pursuant to sections 3210 -C, 10110, 10111 or 10119 21 
if the plan fails to reasonably explain how these elements of the program would 22 
achieve the objectives and implementation requirements of the programs established 23 
under those sections or the measures of performance under subsection 3.  Funds 24 
generated under these statutory authorities may not be used pursuant to the triennial 25 
plan unless those elements of the plan proposing t o use the funds have been approved 26 
by the commission.  The commission shall approve all elements of the triennial plan 27 
it determines to be cost -effective, reliable and achievable and shall incorporate into 28 
gas utility and transmission and distribution rate s sufficient revenue to provide for the 29 
procurement of energy efficiency resources identified within the plan pursuant to 30 
section 10110, subsection 4 -A and section 10111, subsection 2.  The commission 31 
shall approve or reject the entire plan or elements of the plan within 120 days of its 32 
delivery to the commission.  The board, within 30 days of final commission approval 33 
of its plan, shall submit the plan to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 34 
having jurisdiction over energy matters together with any explanatory or other 35 
supporting material as the committee may request and, at the request of the 36 
committee, shall provide a detailed briefing on the final plan.  After receipt of the 37 
plan, the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdic tion over energy 38 
matters may submit legislation relating to the plan.  39 
E.  The trust shall determine the period to be covered by the triennial plan except that 40 
the period of the plan may not interfere with the delivery of any existing contracts to 41 
provide e nergy efficiency services that were previously procured pursuant to 42 
efficiency and conservation programs administered by the commission.  43 
F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 44 
energy efficiency and weathe rization programs that are available to all energy 45 
consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types.  The plan must set forth the costs 46 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR1211(01) -1 
 and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 1 
funding necessary to meet those go als: 2 
(1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;  3 
(2) Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 4 
to participate in and share the costs of cost -effective home weatherization to a 5 
minimum standard of weathe rization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;  6 
(3) Reducing peak -load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 7 
megawatts by 2020;  8 
(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 9 
20% and heating fuel savings of at lea st 20%, as defined in and determined 10 
pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 11 
section 10120;  12 
(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 13 
efficiency products and services in the State by 20 20; and  14 
(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 15 
in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals established in Title 38, 16 
section 576.  17 
The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity f or carbon 18 
emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market.  Any 19 
program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 20 
may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions  21 
generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.  22 
Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 23 
trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 24 
as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 25 
low-income weatherization programs.  26 
As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 27 
#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 28 
processes.  29
