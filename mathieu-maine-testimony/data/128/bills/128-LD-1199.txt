SUMMARY  10 
This bill amends the Maine Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in the following ways:  11 
1.  It defines the term "debt buyer" and requires debt buyers to obtain debt collector 12 
licenses from the Superintendent of Consumer Credit Protect ion; 13 
2.  It requires creditors to transfer specific documentation when selling or otherwise 14 
transferring a consumer debt to another creditor or to a debt buyer;  15 
3.  It prevents a debt buyer from obtaining a default judgment in a collection action 16 
due to th e nonappearance of the consumer in court and instead requires the debt buyer to 17 
provide admissible evidence in support of its claim;  18 
4.  It prohibits a debt buyer from seeking to garnish a consumer's wages to enforce a 19 
judgment obtained against the consume r in a collection action; and  20 
5.  It makes it unlawful for a creditor or a debt collector to attempt to collect a debt 21 
that has been paid, discharged in bankruptcy court or for which the statute of limitations 22 
has expired.  23 
This bill also amends the Maine R evised Statutes, Title 16 to prevent debt buyers 24 
from enjoying the presumption of correctness attendant to an account annexed form of 25 
court action when bringing a lawsuit to enforce a debt.  26
