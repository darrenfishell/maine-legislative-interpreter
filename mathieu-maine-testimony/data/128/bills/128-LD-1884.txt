3 CHAPTER  16
4 COMMUNITY PROTECTION ORDERS
5 SUBCHAPTER 1
6 GENERAL PROVISIONS
7 §401.  Definitions
8 As used in this chapter, unless  the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 
9 have the following meanings.
10 1.  Community protection order.  "Community protection order" means a written 
11 order signed by the court that prohibits and enjoins temporarily, if issued pursuant to 
12 subchapter 2, or on an extended  basis, if issued pursuant  to subchapter 3, a named  
13 individual from having a firearm in that individual's custody or control or owning, 
14 purchasing, possessing  or receiving or attempting to purchase or receive a  firearm.
15 2.  Family or household member.  "Family  or household member" has the same  
16 meaning as  in Title 19-A, section 4002, subsection 4.
17 3.  High-risk individual.  "High-risk individual" means  an individual who presents  
18 an imminent and substantial risk of serious  bodily injury or death to the individual or to 
19 another individual  and:
20 A.  Has a mental illness that may be controlled by medication  but has not 
21 demonstrated a pattern of voluntarily and consistently taking the individual's 
22 medication while not under  supervision; or
23 B.  Is the subject  of documented  evidence  that would give rise to a reasonable belief 
24 that the individual  has a  propensity for violent or  emotionally unstable conduct.
25 The fact that an individual has been released from a mental health facility or has a mental 
26 illness that is currently  controlled by medication  does not establish  that the individual 
27 presents an imminent and substantial risk of serious bodily injury  or death  to the 
28 individual or to another individual for the purposes of this chapter.  As used in this 
29 subsection, "mental illness"  has the same  meaning as in section 3318-A, subsection  1, 
30 paragraph B.
31 4.  Restrained individual.  "Restrained individual" means  an individual who is the 
32 subject of  a community protection order.

Page 2 - 128LR2943(01)-11 §411.  Petition
2 A law enforcement officer or a family  or household  member of a high-risk individual

4 prohibiting and enjoining  the high-risk  individual  who is the subject of the petition from  
5 having in that individual's  custody  or control  or owning,  purchasing,  possessing or 
6 receiving a firearm or attempting  to purchase or receive a firearm. A petition  for a

11 section 411, a court may issue a temporary community protection order  only if the court  
12 finds by clear and convincing evidence that there is cause to believe both of the 
13 following:
14 A.  The  subject of  the petition is  a high-risk individual; and
15 B.  A temporary community  protection  order  is necessary to prevent serious  bodily 
16 injury or death to the  subject  of the petition  or to another  person.
17 2.  Testimony or affidavit under  oath.  The court, before issuing a temporary 
18 community protection order, shall  examine under oath the petitioner and any witness the 
19 petitioner may produce after informing the petitioner and any witness that false testimony 
20 made under  oath is perjury, as defined  in Title 17-A,  section 451, and is a Class C crime.  
21 In lieu of examining the petitioner  and witness, the court may require the petitioner and 
22 witness to submit a written  affidavit  signed under oath. An affidavit supporting a petition  
23 for the issuance of a temporary community  protection order  must set forth the facts  
24 tending to establish  the grounds of the petition  or the reason for believing that the 
25 grounds exist.
26 3.  Determination on same day.  The court shall issue  or deny a temporary 
27 community protection order on  the day that the petition is submitted to the court.
28 4.  Ex parte  order.   The court may issue a temporary community protection  order on 
29 an ex parte  basis.

5 custody or control or own, purchase, possess or receive or attempt  to purchase or receive

7 matter connected with the order."
8 §414.  Effect of temporary community protection order; surrender  of firearm
9 1.  Effect.  A temporary community protection order  prohibits and enjoins the 
10 restrained individual from  having a firearm in the restrained individual's custody or

12 receive a firearm.
13 2.  Surrender order.   Upon issuance of a temporary community protection order,  the

19 served with a temporary community protection order and upon request of a law 
20 enforcement officer, shall immediately surrender all firearms in a safe manner  to the

29 serve the community protection order.  The  law enforcement officer shall:
30 1.  Serve order.  Serve  the temporary community protection order on the restrained 
31 individual as soon as practicable after issuance if the restrained individual  can reasonably 
32 be located;
33 2.  File with court.  File with the court a copy  of the temporary community 
34 protection order  and an inventory of all firearms surrendered as a result of the service of

3 shall retain any firearm surrendered  to a law enforcement officer or law enforcement  
4 agency pursuant to section  414 until the expiration of the temporary community 
5 protection order  that has been  issued against the restrained individual, unless an extended 
6 order is  issued pursuant to section 421.
7 2.  Return  of firearm.  Upon the later of the expiration of a temporary community 
8 protection order  and the expiration of an extended  community protection order, the law 
9 enforcement agency shall return any firearm surrendered by the restrained individual to 
10 the restrained  individual.  The law enforcement agency  may dispose of an unclaimed 
11 firearm in accordance with Title 25, section 3503-A.
12 3.  Law enforcement agency held harmless  for damage to firearm.  A law 
13 enforcement agency must  be held harmless  for any unintentional  damage  to a firearm 
14 surrendered pursuant  to section 414 arising from the prudent and reasonable 
15 transportation and  storage of the surrendered  firearm.
16 4.  Return  to other claimant.  If a person other than the restrained individual  claims  
17 title to a firearm surrendered pursuant  to section 414 and the person is determined  by the 
18 law enforcement agency  that has custody of the firearm to be the lawful owner of the 
19 firearm, the law  enforcement  agency  shall  return the firearm  to that  other person.
20 SUBCHAPTER 5
21 ISSUE  OF EXTENDED COMMUNITY PROTECTION  ORDERS
22 §421.  Hearing
23 Within 21 days after the date upon which  the restrained individual  was served a 
24 temporary community protection order,  the District  Court  shall  hold a hearing to 
25 determine if an extended community protection  order  should issue. At a hearing under 
26 this section,  the petitioner has the burden  of proving  by clear and convincing evidence  
27 that both  of the following are  true:
28 1.  Significant danger to self or others.  The restrained individual poses a 
29 significant and continuing danger  of causing  serious bodily injury or death  to the 
30 restrained individual or presents a continuing substantial  risk of injury to another  
31 individual by having  a firearm in that restrained individual's custody  or control or 
32 owning, purchasing, possessing or  receiving a firearm; and
33 2.  Necessary to prevent harm to self or others.  A community protection order is 
34 necessary to reduce the probability of substantial bodily injury to the restrained individual  
35 or another  individual.
36 The prosecutor shall represent a petitioner  at a hearing  conducted pursuant  to this 
37 section.
Page 5 - 128LR2943(01)-11 §422.  Issuance  of extended community protection order; term of  order
2 1.  Issue.  If the court  finds that the petitioner has met the burden  of proof under 
3 section 421, the court shall issue an extended community protection order  prohibiting the 
4 restrained individual from  having in that individual's  custody or control  or owning, 
5 purchasing, possessing  or receiving or attempting to purchase or receive a  firearm.
6 2.  Term.  An extended community protection order issued pursuant  to this 
7 subchapter expires 180 days  from the date the order is issued.
8 §423.  Dissolution of community protection order
9 If the court finds at a hearing under  section 421 that there is not clear and convincing  
10 evidence to support the issuance of an extended community  protection  order, the court 
11 shall dissolve  any temporary community protection order in effect and may not issue an 
12 extended community protection  order.
13 §424.  Return of firearm
14 Upon the expiration of an extended community  protection order pursuant to section 
15 422, subsection 2 or the dissolution of a community protection order  pursuant to section

17 protection order must be returned to that individual in accordance with section 417, 
18 subsection 2.
19 SUBCHAPTER 7
20 OFFENSE
21 §431.  Offense
22 An individual  who owns or possesses a firearm  knowing that the individual  is 
23 prohibited from doing so by a temporary  community protection order issued pursuant to 
24 subchapter 3 or an extended community protection order  issued after notice  and a hearing 
25 pursuant to subchapter 5 commits a Class D crime. As part of any sentence, the court 
26 shall prohibit  the individual from having in the individual's  custody or control, owning, 
27 purchasing, possessing,  receiving or attempting to purchase or receive a firearm for a 2-
28 year period to commence upon the expiration of  the community protection order.
29 Sec. 2.  19-A MRSA §4002, sub-§4,  as amended by PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. C, §24 
30 and affected by Pt. D, §1, is further amended to read:
31 4.  Family or household members.  "Family or household members"   means spouses 
32 or domestic partners  or former spouses  or former domestic  partners, individuals presently  
33 or formerly  living together as spouses, parents of the same child, adult household  
34 members related by consanguinity or affinity or minor children of a household member 
35 when the defendant is an adult household member  and, for the purposes  of Title 15, 
36 chapter 16, Title  15, section 1023, subsection 4, paragraph B-1 and Title 15, section 
37 1094-B, this chapter and Title 17-A, sections 15, 207-A, 209-A, 210-B, 210-C, 211-A, 
38 1201, 1202 and 1253 only, includes individuals presently or formerly living together and 
Page 6 - 128LR2943(01)-11 individuals who are or were sexual partners. Holding oneself  out to be a spouse is not 
2 necessary to constitute "living as spouses."    For purposes of this subsection, "domestic 
3 partners" means 2 unmarried adults who are domiciled  together under  long-term  
4 arrangements that evidence a commitment to remain responsible indefinitely for each 
5 other's welfare.
6 SUMMARY
7 This bill creates a community protection  order  to authorize  a court to order a person  
8 to surrender  that person's firearms temporarily for 21 days or on an extended basis for 
9 180 days when it has been proved that the person poses  a danger of causing personal  
10 injury to  that person or another  person. The bill provides  that:
11 1.  A law enforcement  officer or a family or household  member may file a petition for 
12 a temporary  community protection  order, which expires in 21 days.  A temporary 
13 community protection order may be issued on an ex parte basis.  The court is required to 
14 hold a hearing  to determine if the temporary community  protection order  should be 
15 extended for an  additional 180  days;
16 2.  A person who is the subject of a community  protection order  is required  to 
17 surrender all firearms  in the person's possession to a law enforcement officer. The 
18 firearms must  be returned  to the person at the expiration of the community  protection 
19 order; and
20 3.  A person who possesses  firearms in violation of a community protection order 
21 commits a Class D crime.  Part of the sentence must  include a prohibition on possession of 
22 firearms for an  additional 2 years.
