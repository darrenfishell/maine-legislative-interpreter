This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $100,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 to a 
newly created DARE Education Reimbursement Fund within the Depaiiment of Education to reimburse school 
districts for the cost of providing DARE programs to students. 
The bill provides one-time transfers of $100,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $100,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund from the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund. 
The Depaiiment of Education has indicated that it does not have staff available to oversee the reimbursement fund. 
Until the volume of work associated with implementing the requirements of this legislation are known, it is unclear 
whether the department can administer the fund within existing resources without impacting other programs and 
services.
