SUMMARY  14 
Current law allows temporary signs to be placed within a public right -of-way for a 15 
maximum of 6 weeks  in a calendar year.  16 
This bill increases to approximately 12 weeks the amount of time that a temporary 17 
sign may be placed within a public right -of-way but restricts the use of those signs to 18 
election years by specifying that they may be placed during the p eriod from May 1st 19 
before a primary election to the Sunday immediately following that primary election and 20 
from October 1st before a general election to the Sunday immediately following that 21 
general election.  22
