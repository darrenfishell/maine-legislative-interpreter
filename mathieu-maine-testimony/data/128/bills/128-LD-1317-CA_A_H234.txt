This bill reinstates the tax credit for employer-assisted day care, which expired at the end of 2015, for tax years 
beginning in 2017 and changes the amount of the credit. It would result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of 
$98,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $294,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a reduction in Local Government Fund 
revenue of $2,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $6,000 in fiscal year 2018-19.
