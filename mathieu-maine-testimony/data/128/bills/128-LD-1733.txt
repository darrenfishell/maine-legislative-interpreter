2 This bill strikes the provisions in current law that define the organizational makeup of 
3 career and technical education centers and regions  and instead authorizes the Department 
4 of Education to adopt rules  that define  the organizational  makeup of career  and technical  
5 education centers and regions.  The bill clarifies that a satellite program may be affiliated 
6 with a region.
