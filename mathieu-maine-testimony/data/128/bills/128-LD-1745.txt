2 Sec. 1.  Legislative findings; contract termination and fund distribution.  
3 The Legislature finds that Stored Solar, LLC,  a Maine  limited liability company  with 
4 biomass resource  facilities located in Jonesboro and West Enfield,  has failed to achieve  
5 the in-state economic benefits required under Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section  1 by 
6 failing to provide  payments  to logging contractors in a reasonable time and by failing to 
7 make sufficient  in-state biomass  purchases pursuant to the contract entered into between 
8 Central Maine Power Company and Stored  Solar,  LLC,  pursuant to Public Utilities 
9 Commission Docket No. 2016- 00084 and in accordance with Public Law 2015, chapter 
10 483, section 1.  The Legislature further  finds that Stored Solar, LLC has failed  in its 
11 commitment to continually operate its biomass resource  facilities at least at 50% capacity 
12 except for planned and forced outages; therefore, notwithstanding any provision of Public 
13 Law 2015,  chapter  483, the Public Utilities Commission:
14 1.  Fund transfer prohibited.  May not transfer any funds  from the fund established  
15 in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection  5 for the above -market costs for 
16 energy supplied  from  the biomass resources of Stored  Solar, LLC pursuant to any 
17 contract entered  into pursuant to Public Utilities Commission  Docket  No. 2016-00084 
18 and in effect on  the effective date of this Act;
19 2.  Payments to logging contractors.  Shall distribute funds from the fund 
20 established in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, subsection 5 that are designated 
21 for Stored Solar, LLC to logging  contractors that have not received payment for services 
22 provided, as of the effective date of this Act, to Stored  Solar, LLC to run its biomass 
23 resource facilities  in Jonesboro and West  Enfield; and
24 3.  Fund transfer.  Shall direct a transmission and distribution utility to enter  into a 
25 contract for no more  than 40 megawatts  of biomass resources with the biomass resource 
26 facility that submitted the next-highest ranked  conforming  bid after Stored Solar, LLC in 
27 response to the competitive solicitation issued by the Public Utilities Commission on June 
28 17, 2016,  pursuant to Public Utilities Commission Docket  No. 2016-00084, if the

31 must be paid with any funds  remaining  in the fund after making all payments under 
32 subsection 2.  The contract requirements in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section 1, 
33 subsection 3 govern the contract entered into in accordance  with this subsection.  Any 
34 funds remaining in the fund established in Public Law 2015, chapter 483, section  1, 
35 subsection 5 after all the above- market costs are paid in accordance with this subsection  
36 and payments are made in accordance with subsection 2 must be transferred to the Maine  
37 Budget Stabilization Fund  established  under  Title  5, section 1532.
38 Sec. 2.  Recovery of funds.  The Public Utilities Commission shall request that the 
39 Attorney General  investigate Stored  Solar,  LLC and institute any proceedings against  
40 Stored Solar, LLC to recover from Stored  Solar,  LLC  an amount equal  to the amount of 
41 funds that were distributed  by the commission to contractors  in accordance with section 
42 1, subsection 2.  If the State  prevails in its action against  Stored Solar, LLC under  this 
43 section, the court shall  award  to the State the costs of investigation, expert  witness fees,

4 SUMMARY
5 This bill contains legislative findings regarding the failure of Stored Solar, LLC to 
6 achieve in-state economic benefits  and to continually operate its biomass resource 
7 facilities at least at 50% capacity  except for planned and forced  outages as required by 
8 law and contract.
9 This bill prohibits the Public Utilities Commission from  providing any funds from  the 
10 cost recovery  fund to pay the above- market  costs for energy  supplied from the biomass 
11 resources of Stored Solar, LLC  pursuant to a contract entered  into between Central Maine  
12 Power Company and Stored Solar,  LLC.  It requires  the commission to distribute funds 
13 from the cost recovery fund that are designated for Stored Solar, LLC to contractors that 
14 have not received  payment for services provided to Stored Solar, LLC to run its biomass 
15 resource facilities in Jonesboro and West  Enfield.  It requires the commission to direct a 
16 transmission and distribution utility to enter  into a contract for no more than 40 
17 megawatts of biomass resources with a biomass facility  that serves  the ISO-NE region  
18 and that was the next-highest  conforming bid after Stored Solar,  LLC in a competitive 
19 solicitation issued by the Public  Utilities Commission on June 17, 2016.  It requires the 
20 above-market costs of the contract to be paid from any funds remaining  in the cost 
21 recovery fund after payments are made to contractors and subject to meeting contract 
22 terms.
23 This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to request  that the Attorney 
24 General investigate  Stored  Solar, LLC and institute any proceedings against  Stored Solar, 
25 LLC to recover  from Stored Solar,  LLC  an amount  equal to the amount of those funds 
26 distributed to contractors by the commission pursuant to this legislation.   It specifies  that 
27 any money  recovered by the Attorney  General must  be transferred  to the Maine Budget 
28 Stabilization Fund established under the Maine Revised  Statutes, Title 5, section  1532.
