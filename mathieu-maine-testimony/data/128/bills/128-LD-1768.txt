30 A.  Segregate a portion of the sample for that person's  own testing.  Within  5 days 
31 after notice of the test result  is given to the employee or applicant, the employee or 
32 applicant shall notify  the employer of the testing laboratory selected  by the employee 
33 or applicant.  This laboratory must  comply with the requirements  of this section 
34 related to testing laboratories.  When the employer  receives notice  of the employee or 
35 applicant's selection, the employer shall  promptly send the segregated  portion of the 
36 sample to the named testing laboratory, subject to the same chain of custody 
37 requirements applicable  to testing of the employer's portion of the sample.   The 
38 employee or applicant shall  pay the costs of these  tests.  Payment for these tests may 
39 not be required  earlier than when notice of the choice  of laboratory is given to the 
40 employer; and
41 B.  In the case of an employee, have a blood sample taken from  the employee  by a 
42 licensed physician, registered physician's assistant, registered nurse or a person  
43 certified by the Department  of Health and Human Services to draw blood samples.   
Page 10 - 128LR2645(01)-11 The employer shall have this sample tested  for the presence of alcohol  or marijuana 
2 metabolites, if those substances are to be tested for under  the employer's written  
3 uniform impairment and substance use testing policy  adopted  pursuant to subsection  
4 2.  If the employee requests that a blood sample be taken as provided in this 
5 paragraph, the employer may not test any other sample from the employee for the 
6 presence of these substances.
7 (1)  The Department  of Health and Human Services may identify,  by rules  
8 adopted under section  687, other substances of abuse for which an employee may 
9 request a blood sample be tested instead of a urine sample if the department 
10 determines that a sufficient correlation exists between the presence of the 
11 substance in an individual's blood and its effect  upon the individual's 
12 performance.
13 (2)  No An employer may not require,  request or suggest that any employee  or 
14 applicant provide a blood sample for substance abuse use testing purposes nor 
15 may any employer  conduct a substance abuse use test upon a blood sample  
16 except as  provided in this paragraph.
17 (3)  Applicants  do not have the right  to require the employer to test a blood 
18 sample as provided  in this  paragraph.
19 5-A.  Point of collection screening  test.  Except as provided in this subsection, all 
20 provisions of this subchapter regulating  screening tests apply to noninstrumented  point of 
21 collection test devices described  in section 682, subsection  7, paragraph  A, subparagraph 
22 (1).
23 A.  A noninstrumented point of collection  test described in section  682, subsection 7, 
24 paragraph A, subparagraph  (1) may be performed at the point of collection  rather 
25 than in a laboratory.  Subsections 6 and 7 and subsection 8, paragraphs A to C do not 
26 apply to such screening tests.  Subsection 5 applies  only to a sample that results in a 
27 positive test  result.
28 B.  Any sample that results  in a negative  test result must be destroyed.  Any sample 
29 that results in a postive positive  test result must be sent to a qualified testing 
30 laboratory consistent with subsections  6 to 8 for  confirmation  testing.
31 C.  A person  who performs a point of collection screening test or a confirmation test 
32 may release the results of that test  only as follows.
33 (1)  For a point of collection screening test that results in a preliminary positive 
34 or negative  test result,  the person performing the test shall release the test result 
35 to the employee who is the subject of the test immediately.
36 (2)  For a point of collection screening test that results in a preliminary positive 
37 test result,  the person performing the test may not release the test result to the 
38 employer until after  the result of the confirmation test has  been  determined.
39 (3)  For a point of collection screening test that results  in a preliminary  negative  
40 test result,  the person performing the test may not release the test result to the 
41 employer until after the result of a confirmation test would have been determined 
42 if one had been performed.
Page 11 - 128LR2645(01)-11 (4)  For a confirmation  test, the person performing  the test shall release the result 
2 immediately to the employee who is the  subject of the test  and to the employer.
3 6.  Qualified testing laboratories  required.   No An employer may not perform any 
4 substance abuse use test administered to any of that employer's employees.   An employer 
5 may perform  screening  tests administered to applicants  if the employer's testing facilities  
6 comply with the requirements for testing laboratories under this subsection.   Except as 
7 provided in subsection 5-A, any substance abuse use test administered under  this 
8 subchapter must be performed in a qualified  testing laboratory that complies with this 
9 subsection.
10 B.  The laboratory must  have written testing  procedures and procedures to ensure a 
11 clear chain  of custody.
12 C.  The laboratory  must demonstrate satisfactory performance in the proficiency  
13 testing program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the College  of American 
14 Pathology or the American  Association for Clinical Chemistry.
15 D.  The laboratory  must comply with rules adopted by the Department of Health  and 
16 Human Services under section 687.  These rules  shall  must ensure  that:
17 (1)  The laboratory  possesses  all licenses or certifications that the department 
18 finds necessary or desirable  to ensure reliable and  accurate test results;
19 (2)  The laboratory follows proper quality  control procedures, including, but not 
20 limited to:
21 (a)  The use of internal quality controls  during each substance abuse use test 
22 conducted under this subchapter, including  the use of blind samples and 
23 samples of known concentrations  which  that are used to check the 
24 performance and calibration  of testing equipment;
25 (b)  The internal  review and certification process for test results, including 
26 the qualifications of the person who performs  that function in the testing 
27 laboratory; and
28 (c)  Security measures  implemented by the testing laboratory; and
29 (3)  Other necessary  and proper  actions  are taken to ensure reliable and accurate 
30 test results.
31 7.  Testing procedure.  A testing laboratory shall perform a screening test on each 
32 sample submitted  by the employer for only those substances  of abuse that the employer 
33 requests to be identified.  If a screening test result is negative, no further  test may be 
34 conducted on that sample.   If a screening test result is positive, a confirmation test shall 
35 must be performed on that sample.   A testing laboratory shall  retain all confirmed 
36 positive samples  for one year in a manner  that will inhibit deterioration of the samples  
37 and allow  subsequent retesting.  All other samples shall  must  be disposed of immediately 
38 after testing.
39 8.  Laboratory report of test results.   This subsection governs the reporting  of test 
40 results.
Page 12 - 128LR2645(01)-11 A.  A laboratory report of  test results shall must, at a minimum, state:
2 (1)  The name of the  laboratory that  performed the test or tests;
3 (2)  Any confirmed positive results on any tested  sample.
4 (a)  Unless the employee  or applicant consents, test results shall may not be 
5 reported in numerical or quantitative  form but shall must state only that the 
6 test result was positive or negative.  This division does not apply  if the test or 
7 the test results become the subject of any grievance procedure, administrative 
8 proceeding or civil action.
9 (b)  A testing laboratory and the employer must shall ensure that an 
10 employee's unconfirmed positive screening test result cannot be determined 
11 by the employer in any manner, including, but not limited to, the method  of 
12 billing the employer for the tests performed by the laboratory and the time 
13 within which results are provided to the employer.  This division does not 
14 apply to test  results for  applicants;
15 (3)  The sensitivity or cutoff level  of the confirmation  test; and
16 (4)  Any available information concerning the margin  of accuracy  and precision 
17 of the test methods employed.
18 The report shall  may not disclose the presence or absence of evidence of any physical  
19 or mental condition or of any substance other than the specific substances  of abuse  
20 that the employer requested to be identified.  A testing laboratory shall  retain records 
21 of confirmed  positive results in a numerical or quantitative form  for at  least 2 years.
22 B.  The employer shall promptly notify  the employee or applicant tested  of the test 
23 result.  Upon request of an employee or applicant, the employer shall promptly 
24 provide a legible copy of the laboratory report to the employee or applicant.  Within 3 
25 working days after notice of a confirmed  positive test result, the employee or 
26 applicant may submit information to the employer  explaining or contesting  the 
27 results.
28 C.  The testing  laboratory  shall send test reports for samples segregated at an 
29 employee's or applicant's  request under subsection  5, paragraph A, to both the 
30 employer and the employee or applicant tested.
31 D.  Every employer whose uniform impairment and substance use testing policy 
32 certification is approved by the Department of Labor under section  686 shall annually  
33 send to the department  a compilation of the results  of all substance  abuse use tests 
34 administered by that employer in the previous calendar  year.  This report  shall must  
35 provide separate categories for employees  and applicants and shall must be presented 
36 in statistical  form so that no a person who was tested by that employer can cannot be 
37 identified from  the report.  The report shall must include a separate category for any 
38 tests conducted on a  random or  arbitrary basis under section 684, subsection 3.
39 E.  Any laboratory-confirmed positive substance use test results must be reported  to a 
40 medical review  officer.   The medical review officer  may be directly  or indirectly  
41 retained by the employer but shall  act independently in carrying out any testing 
42 reviews or recommendations.   The medical review officer shall  contact the employee 
Page 13 - 128LR2645(01)-11 and, if necessary, the employee's  physician to review each confirmed positive 
2 substance use test or any test found to be adulterated,  substituted or otherwise  invalid 
3 to determine whether there is, in the opinion of the medical review officer,  a 
4 legitimate medical explanation for the result.  An exchange between the employee 
5 and the medical review officer is not subject to doctor-patient relationship  
6 confidentiality, although  the medical review  officer shall protect the confidentiality of 
7 the drug testing information as otherwise provided in this chapter.  The medical 
8 review officer may not disclose the presence  or absence  of any physical or mental  
9 condition of the employee, the presence  or absence of any substances other  than those 
10 allowed to be tested for under  Department of Health  and Human  Services  laboratory 
11 testing rules or the presence or absence of any substance for which there is a 
12 legitimate medical  explanation.
13 9.  Costs.  The employer shall pay the costs of all substance abuse use tests to which  
14 the employer requires, requests  or suggests that an employee  or applicant submit.   Except 
15 as provided in paragraph A, the employee or applicant  shall  pay the costs of any 
16 additional substance abuse  use tests.
17 Costs of a substance abuse use test administered at the request  of an employee under  
18 subsection 5, paragraph  B, shall must be paid:
19 A.  By the employer  if the test results  are negative for all substances  of abuse  tested  
20 for in the sample; and
21 B.  By the employee if the test results in a confirmed  positive  result for any of the 
22 substances of abuse tested  for in the sample.
23 10.  Limitation on use of tests.  An employer may administer substance abuse use 
24 tests to employees or applicants  only for the purpose of discovering  the use of any 
25 substance of abuse likely to cause impairment of the user or the use of any scheduled 
26 drug.  No An employer may not have substance abuse use tests administered to an 
27 employee or  applicant for the purpose  of discovering any  other  information.
28 11.  Rules.  The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt  any rules  
29 under section 687 regulating substance abuse use testing procedures that it finds 
30 necessary or desirable to ensure accurate and reliable substance  abuse use testing and to 
31 protect the privacy  rights of employees  and applicants.
32 Sec. 11.  26 MRSA §684, as amended  by PL 2003, c. 547, §2, is further amended 
33 to read:
34 §684.  Imposition of tests
35 1.  Testing  of applicants.  An employer  may require, request or suggest that an 
36 applicant submit to a  substance  abuse use  test only if:
37 A.  The  applicant has been offered employment with the employer; or
38 B.  The applicant has been offered  a position on a roster of eligibility  from  which  
39 applicants will be selected for employment.  The number of persons on this roster of 
Page 14 - 128LR2645(01)-11 eligibility may not exceed the number  of applicants hired by that employer  in the 
2 preceding 6 months.
3 The offer of employment or offer  of a position on a roster of eligibility may be 
4 conditioned on the applicant  receiving a negative  test result.
5 2.  Probable  cause  testing of employees.  An employer may require, request  or 
6 suggest that an employee submit to a substance abuse test if the employer has probable 
7 cause to  test the employee.
8 A.  The employee's  immediate supervisor,  other supervisory personnel,  a licensed  
9 physician or nurse,  or the employer's security personnel shall make  the determination 
10 of probable  cause.
11 B.  The supervisor  or other  person  must state, in writing, the facts  upon which this 
12 determination is based and  provide a copy  of the statement to the employee.
13 2-A.  Impairment  detection  required;  testing  of employees.  An employer may 
14 require, request  or suggest that an employee  submit to a substance  use test, an impairment 
15 determination by an occupational health care provider, or both, only if the employer has 
16 made an impairment  detection regarding the employee pursuant to this subsection.
17 A.  Only supervisory,  human resources or security  personnel  approved for 
18 impairment detection by the Department of Labor or a licensed physician  or nurse  
19 may make an impairment detection regarding an  individual employee.
20 B.  The person making the impairment  detection shall state in writing, on a form 
21 provided by the Department of Labor, the facts upon which the detection is based,  
22 and shall provide  a copy of the completed form to the employee as soon as possible 
23 but no later than 24 hours from the time the detection is made.  The completed 
24 impairment detection form  must be provided  to the employee prior  to any substance  
25 use testing  of that employee.
26 C.  At least 2 weeks prior to conducting any impairment detection activities  under 
27 this subsection, the employer must provide the Department of Labor  with a list of all 
28 positions subject to impairment detection activities  and notify employees by posting 
29 that list in a location accessible  to all employees.  The employer may amend  the list 
30 as long as, at least 2 weeks prior to any impairment detection activities, employees  
31 whose positions are being  added to the list are notified  of their inclusion on the list, 
32 the amended list is posted  in a location accessible  to employees and the amended list 
33 is submitted to the  department.
34 D.  Subject to any limitation of the Maine  Human Rights Act or any other  state or 
35 federal law, there may be no cause  of action against an employer  for making and 
36 acting upon impairment detection in accordance with this subsection as long as the 
37 completed impairment detection form  is provided to the employee and the 
38 impairment detection  is based on the employer's good faith belief that the employee 
39 was impaired  at work.
40 E.  An impairment detection  may not be based exclusively on:
41 (1)  Information received from an anonymous  informant; or
Page 15 - 128LR2645(01)-11 (2)  Any information tending to indicate that an employee may have possessed or 
2 used a substance of abuse off duty, except when the employee is observed  
3 possessing or ingesting any substance of abuse while either on the employer's  
4 premises or in the proximity  of the employer's premises during or immediately 
5 before the employee's  working hours.
6 2-B.  Impairment  determination; temporary removal.   If an impairment detection 
7 is made,  the employer may immediately remove  the employee, or temporary employee, 
8 from the workplace  pending  resolution of the impairment  detection.
9 A.  Any impairment detection must be confirmed  through a medical review by an 
10 occupational health care provider prior to any further  action by the employer  based 
11 on the impairment determination.  The occupational health care provider may require 
12 that the employee submit to testing for substances of abuse, including prescription 
13 medications, to assist in investigating and confirming the impairment detection.  The 
14 occupational health care provider  may perform a fitness- for-duty evaluation of the 
15 employee.  The occupational  health care provider may direct the employee to obtain 
16 further medical evaluation  either by the employee's physician or by another licensed 
17 physician acceptable  to the occupational health care provider.
18 B.  Any substance use testing  subsequent  to an impairment detection confirmation 
19 must be done by an independent testing facility,  and all screening and confirmatory 
20 test results must be delivered  to the medical review  officer for review  according to 
21 section 683, subsection 8, paragraph E.  The medical review officer shall  provide the 
22 results to the occupational  health care provider and may not provide the results to the 
23 employer.  When an employer is using a substance use test only, the medical review  
24 officer shall provide the results to the employer.   The presence of prescription 
25 medications may be tested for only when impairment  detection has been  made and 
26 only for the purpose of assisting the occupational health care provider  in evaluating 
27 whether an employee is impaired and the cause of the impairment.
28 C.  The occupational  health  care provider shall make the final determination of 
29 whether an employee was or is impaired, identify the cause  of any impairment,  
30 determine whether the employee can continue to perform  any safety-sensitive task or 
31 occupation and determine  the impairment  remediation  program, if any, necessary to 
32 ensure that the impairment will not recur or will not adversely affect  the safety  of the 
33 employee, coworkers and other persons at the work site in the future.   The 
34 occupational health care provider  may also make further  recommendations regarding 
35 the employee's ability to safely  perform  all assigned tasks, including requiring  any 
36 remedial measures, which may include, without limitation, compliance with return-
37 to-work agreements or a written agreement by the employee to schedule any 
38 necessary medications in a manner that will not lead to impairment on the job.  A 
39 return-to-work agreement may be used if an employee has violated the established 
40 drug-free workplace policy and has been provided  the opportunity  to participate in 
41 treatment as  a condition of continued  employment or reemployment.
42 D.  If the occupational health care provider finds that the employee was not impaired  
43 on the job or that any such impairment did not pose a safety risk and did not violate 
44 the employer's established drug-free workplace policy, the employer shall reinstate 
45 the employee to the  employee's position.
Page 16 - 128LR2645(01)-11 E.  If an impairment detection is made at a time when an occupational health care 
2 provider is not normally  available for work, the employer may take any steps to 
3 remove the employee, and, prior to the employee's next scheduled work day, the 
4 employer may determine whether to allow the employee to return  to work or to 
5 request an impairment determination or fitness-for-duty evaluation by the 
6 occupational health  care  provider.
7 An occupational health care provider who makes or acts upon an impairment 
8 determination in accordance with this subsection is not subject to a cause of action  as 
9 long as the determination  is based on the occupational health care provider's  good faith, 
10 professional judgment.  An occupational health care provider may not be an employee or 
11 agent of, or have any financial interest in, a testing laboratory  for which  the occupational 
12 health care provider is reviewing drug test results.   An occupational  health  care provider 
13 may not derive any financial  benefit by having an employer use a laboratory that may be 
14 construed as a potential  conflict of interest.
15 3.  Random or arbitrary testing of employees.  In addition to testing employees  on 
16 a probable  cause basis under  subsection 2, an An employer may require, request  or 
17 suggest that an employee  submit to a substance abuse use test on a random  or arbitrary 
18 basis if:
19 A.  The employer and the employee have bargained for provisions in a collective 
20 bargaining agreement, either before or after the effective date of this subchapter, that 
21 provide for random or arbitrary testing of employees.   A random  or arbitrary testing 
22 program that would result from implementation  of an employer's last best offer is not 
23 considered a provision bargained for in a collective bargaining  agreement for 
24 purposes of  this section;
25 B.  The employee works in a position the nature  of which  would create an 
26 unreasonable could  pose a threat  to the health or safety of the public or the 
27 employee's coworkers if the employee were under the influence  of impaired by a 
28 substance of abuse.  It is the intent  of the Legislature that the requirements of this 
29 paragraph be narrowly construed; or
30 C.  The employer has established a random  or arbitrary testing program  under this 
31 paragraph that applies to all employees, except as provided in subparagraph (4), 
32 regardless of  position.
33 (1)  An employer may establish a testing program under this paragraph only if the 
34 employer has 50 10 or more employees who are not covered by a collective 
35 bargaining agreement.
36 (2)  The written policy  required by section 683, subsection 2 with respect to a 
37 testing program  under this paragraph must be developed  by a committee  of at 
38 least 10 of the employer's employees.   The employer shall appoint members  to 
39 the committee  from  a cross-section of employees who are eligible  to be tested.   
40 The committee must  include a medical  professional who is trained  in procedures 
41 for testing for substances of abuse.  If no such person is employed  by the 
42 employer, the employer  shall obtain  the services  of such a person to serve as a 
43 member of  the committee created under  this subparagraph.
Page 17 - 128LR2645(01)-11 (2-A) An employer may establish a random or arbitrary testing program  under 
2 this paragraph if the employer is required to test employees to retain  a contract.  
3 An employee  may be allowed to sign a waiver exempting the employee from  
4 testing when required  for a contract  and the employee acknowledges that the 
5 employee may not have an opportunity to work  under the contract for which 
6 testing is required.
7 (3)  The written policy developed under subparagraph (2) must  also require that 
8 selection of employees for testing be performed by a person or entity not subject  
9 to the employer's influence,  such as a medical review officer.  Selection  must be 
10 made from a list, provided  by the employer,  of all employees subject  to testing 
11 under this paragraph. The list may not contain information  that would identify  the 
12 employee to the person  or entity making the selection.
13 (4)  Employees who are covered by a collective  bargaining agreement are not 
14 included in testing programs  pursuant to this paragraph unless they agree to be 
15 included pursuant to a collective  bargaining  agreement as described under 
16 paragraph A.
17 (5)  Before initiating a testing program under this paragraph, the employer  must  
18 obtain from the Department of Labor approval of the policy developed by the 
19 employee committee,  as required in section 686.  If the employer  does not 
20 approve of the written  policy developed  by the employee  committee,  the 
21 employer may decide not to submit the policy  to the department  and not to 
22 establish the testing  program.  The employer may not change the written policy 
23 without approval of the  employee committee.
24 (6)  The employer may not discharge, suspend, demote, discipline or otherwise  
25 discriminate with regard to compensation or working conditions against an 
26 employee for participating or refusing to participate  in an employee committee  
27 created pursuant to this  paragraph.
28 (7) An arbitrary  test may be conducted only on an employee whose job is of a 
29 nature that could pose a threat to the health or safety of the public or coworkers if 
30 the employee were impaired by  a substance of  abuse.
31 4.  Testing  while  undergoing treatment.   While the employee is participating in a 
32 substance abuse rehabilitation treatment program either as a result of voluntary contact 
33 with or mandatory a referral to the employer's employee assistance program or after a 
34 confirmed positive test result as provided in section 685, subsection 2, paragraphs B and 
35 C, substance  abuse use testing may be conducted by the rehabilitation or treatment 
36 provider as  required, requested or suggested by that provider.
37 A.  Substance abuse use testing conducted as part of such a rehabilitation or treatment 
38 program is not subject  to the provisions of this subchapter regulating substance abuse 
39 use testing.
40 B.  An employer may not require, request or suggest that any substance abuse use test 
41 be administered  to any an employee  while the employee is undergoing such 
42 rehabilitation or treatment, except as provided in subsections 2 2-A and 3.
Page 18 - 128LR2645(01)-11 C.  The results of any substance abuse use test administered to an employee as part of 
2 such a rehabilitation or treatment program may not be released to the employer.
3 5.  Testing upon  return to work.  If an employee  who has received a confirmed 
4 positive test result  returns  to work  with the same  employer, whether or not the employee 
5 has participated in a rehabilitation treatment  program under  section 685, subsection  2, the 
6 employer may require,  request or suggest that the employee submit to a subsequent  
7 substance abuse use test anytime  any time between 90 days and one year after the date of 
8 the employee's prior test.  A test may be administered under  this subsection  in addition  to 
9 any tests conducted under  subsections 2 2-A and 3.  An employer  may require, request  or 
10 suggest that an employee  submit to a substance abuse use test during the first 90 days 
11 after the date of the employee's prior  test only as provided in subsections  2 2-A and 3.
12 Sec. 12.  26 MRSA §685, as amended  by PL 2003, c. 547, §3, is further amended 
13 to read:
14 §685.  Action  taken on substance  use tests
15 Action taken by an employer on the basis of a substance abuse  use test is limited as 
16 provided in this section.
17 1.  Before receipt  of test results.  An employer may suspend an employee with full 
18 pay and benefits  or may transfer the employee  to another position with no reduction in 
19 pay or benefits while awaiting an employee's test results.
20 2.  Use of confirmation test results.   This subsection governs an employer's  use of 
21 confirmed positive test results and an employee's or applicant's  refusal to submit to a test 
22 requested or  required by an  employer in compliance with this subchapter.
23 A.  Subject to any limitation  of the Maine Human Rights  Act or any other  state law or 
24 federal law, and to provisions in this subsection, an employer may use a confirmed  
25 positive test result or for a substance of abuse, refusal to submit to a substance use 
26 test, a violation of an established drug-free workplace policy or an impairment 
27 confirmed by an occupational health care provider pursuant to section 684, 
28 subsection 2- B as a factor  in any of  the following decisions:
29 (1)  Refusal to hire an applicant for employment or refusal to place an applicant 
30 on a roster  of eligibility;
31 (2)  Discharge of an  employee;
32 (3)  Discipline of an  employee; or
33 (4)  Change in the employee's work assignment.
34 A-1.  An employer who tests a person  as an applicant  and employs that person prior 
35 to receiving  the test result may take no action on a confirmed positive test result  
36 except in accordance with the employee  provisions of the employer's approved 
37 uniform impairment and substance  use testing policy adopted pursuant  to section 683, 
38 subsection 2.
Page 19 - 128LR2645(01)-11 B.  Before taking any action described in paragraph  A in the case of an employee 
2 who receives an initial confirmed positive test result, an employer shall  may provide 
3 the employee with an opportunity to participate for up to 6 months 12 weeks  in a 
4 rehabilitation treatment program designed to enable the employee to avoid future  use 
5 of a substance  of abuse and to participate  in an employee  assistance program, if the 
6 employer has such a program.   A confirmed  impairment under  section 684, 
7 subsection 2-B caused by a substance of abuse is the same as an initial confirmed 
8 positive test result for purposes of this paragraph,  with or without a substance use test 
9 result.  A treatment program under this paragraph may be provided by an 
10 occupational health care provider.  Participation  by an employee in a treatment 
11 program must begin within 30 days of the employee's receiving notice of the positive 
12 test result  or confirmed impairment, unless otherwise agreed to by the employer.  The 
13 employer may take any action described in paragraph  A if the employee receives  a 
14 subsequent confirmed  positive test result  from a substance  use test administered by 
15 the employer under this subchapter or the employee receives a subsequent confirmed 
16 impairment caused by a  substance  of abuse with or  without  a substance use test .
17 C.  If the employee chooses  not to participate in a rehabilitation  treatment program  
18 under this subsection, the employer may take any action described  in paragraph A.  If 
19 the employee chooses to participate in a rehabilitation treatment program, the 
20 following provisions apply.
21 (1)  If the employer has an employee assistance program that offers  counseling  or 
22 rehabilitation treatment services, the employee may choose to enter  that program 
23 at the employer's  expense with any costs not covered by the employer's  portion of 
24 the employee  assistance program to be paid by the employee unless the employer  
25 chooses to cover such costs .  If these services  are not available from an 
26 employer's employee assistance program or if the employee chooses  not to 
27 participate in that program, the employee may enter a public or private 
28 rehabilitation treatment program.
29 (a)  Except to the extent that costs are covered  by a group health insurance 
30 plan, the costs of the public or private  rehabilitation  treatment program  must  
31 be equally divided between  the employer  and employee if the employer has 
32 more than 20 full-time employees.  This requirement does not apply to 
33 municipalities or other political subdivisions of the State or to any employer  
34 when the employee is tested  because of the alcohol and controlled substance 
35 testing mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation  Employee Testing 
36 Act of 1991, Public Law 102-143, Title V.  If necessary, the paid by the 
37 employee.  The employer shall may assist in financing the cost share of the 
38 employee employee's costs through a payroll  deduction  plan.
39 (b)  Except to the extent that costs are covered  by a group health  insurance 
40 plan, an employer  with 20 or fewer  full-time employees, a municipality or 
41 other political subdivision  of the State  is not required to pay for any costs of 
42 rehabilitation or treatment  under any public  or private  rehabilitation  treatment 
43 program.  An employer  is not required  to pay for the costs  of rehabilitation 
44 treatment if the employee  was tested because of the alcohol  and controlled  
45 substance testing  mandated  by the federal  Omnibus Transportation  Employee 
46 Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102-143, Title V.
Page 20 - 128LR2645(01)-11 (2)  No An employer may not take any action described in paragraph A while an 
2 employee is participating  in a rehabilitation treatment program, except as 
3 provided in subparagraph  (2-A)  and except that an employer may change the 
4 employee's work assignment or suspend the employee from active duty to reduce 
5 any possible safety hazard.  Except as provided in subparagraph (2-A), an 
6 employee's pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee  is participating 
7 in a rehabilitation treatment  program, provided except that the employer is not 
8 required to pay the employee for periods  in which  the employee  is unavailable 
9 for work  for the purposes of rehabilitation treatment or while the employee is 
10 medically disqualified.   The employee may apply normal  sick leave  and or 
11 vacation time leave, if any available, for these periods or available family 
12 medical leave  for which the employee may  qualify under state or  federal law.
13 (2-A)  A rehabilitation  or treatment provider shall promptly  notify  the employer 
14 if the employee fails to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation treatment 
15 program before the expiration of the 6-month  12-week period provided in 
16 paragraph B.  Upon receipt  of this notice, the employer may take any action 
17 described in paragraph  A.
18 (3)  Except as provided  in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 
19 rehabilitation treatment  program, as determined by the rehabilitation or treatment 
20 provider after consultation with the employer, the employee is entitled  to return  
21 to the employee's previous  job with full pay and benefits unless conditions 
22 unrelated to the employee's previous confirmed  positive test result make the 
23 employee's return impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must may not 
24 conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement between the 
25 employer and a labor  organization that is the collective  bargaining representative 
26 of the unit of which the employee  is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or 
27 treatment provider determines that the employee has not successfully  completed 
28 the rehabilitation treatment program within 6 4 months after starting the program, 
29 the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.
30 (a)  If the employee who has completed rehabilitation  treatment previously 
31 worked in an employment position subject to random or arbitrary  testing 
32 under an employer's written policy, the employer  may refuse to allow  the 
33 employee to return to the previous job if the employer believes  that the 
34 employee may pose an unreasonable safety hazard because  of the nature  of 
35 the position.   The employer shall attempt to find suitable work for the 
36 employee immediately after refusing the employee's return to the previous 
37 position.  No reduction may be made in the employee's  previous benefits  or 
38 rate of pay while  awaiting reassignment  to work or while working in a 
39 position other than the previous job.  The employee shall must be reinstated 
40 to the previous position or to another  position  with an equivalent rate of pay 
41 and benefits and with no loss of seniority  within 6 months after returning  to 
42 work in any capacity with the employer unless the employee  has received a 
43 subsequent confirmed positive test result within that time from a test 
44 administered under this subchapter  or unless conditions unrelated to the 
45 employee's previous  confirmed positive test result  make that reinstatement  or 
46 reassignment impossible.  Placement of the employee in suitable work and 
Page 21 - 128LR2645(01)-11 reinstatement may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining  
2 agreement between the employer  and a labor organization that is the 
3 collective bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or 
4 would be a part.
5 (b)  Notwithstanding division  (a), if an employee who has successfully  
6 completed rehabilitation treatment is medically disqualified, the employer  is 
7 not required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 
8 during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not required to 
9 compensate the employee during the period  of disqualification.  Immediately 
10 after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 
11 obligations under division (a) attach as if the employee  had successfully 
12 completed rehabilitation treatment on that  date.
13 D.  This subsection does not require an employer to take any disciplinary action 
14 against an employee who refuses  to submit  to a test, receives a single  or repeated 
15 confirmed positive  test result or does not choose to participate in a rehabilitation 
16 treatment program.   This subsection is intended  to set minimum opportunities for an 
17 employee with a substance  abuse  problem to address the problem  through 
18 rehabilitation.  An employer may offer additional opportunities, not otherwise in 
19 violation of this subchapter, for rehabilitation treatment or continued employment 
20 without rehabilitation treatment.
21 3.  Confidentiality.  This subsection governs the use of information  acquired by an 
22 employer in the  testing process.
23 A.  Unless the employee  or applicant consents, all information acquired by an 
24 employer in the testing process is confidential  and may not be released to any person  
25 other than the employee or applicant who is tested, any necessary personnel of the 
26 employer and a provider of rehabilitation or treatment services under subsection  2, 
27 paragraph C.   This paragraph  does not prevent:
28 (1) The release of this information  when required or permitted by state or federal  
29 law, including release under  section  683, subsection 8, paragraph D; or
30 (2)  The use of this information in any grievance procedure, administrative 
31 hearing or civil action relating to the imposition of the test or the use of test 
32 results.
33 B.  Notwithstanding any other law, the results of any substance abuse use test 
34 required, requested  or suggested by any employer may not be used in any criminal 
35 proceeding.
36 Sec. 13.  26 MRSA §686, as amended  by PL 2009, c. 133, §3, is further amended 
37 to read:

2 complies with this subchapter and shall  immediately  notify the employer who 
3 submitted the policy  or change of that determination certification  of adoption of the 
4 uniform impairment and substance use testing policy  is complete.  If the department

8 certification is determined  to be complete, the department shall approve the 
9 conducting of substance use testing by the employer in accordance with this 
10 subchapter and shall notify the employer of this approval.
11 B.  The department  may request additional information from an employer  when 
12 necessary to determine whether  an employment position meets the requirements of

25 employees may submit written comments to the department  challenging  any portion 
26 of the employer's written  policy, including the proposed designation  of any position 
27 under section  684, subsection 3, paragraph  B.
28 B.  Nothing in this section requires  a formal hearing  to be held concerning the 
29 submission and review of an employer's  written  certification  of adoption of the

4 SUMMARY
5 This bill makes changes to the laws governing  employment  practices concerning 
6 substance abuse testing, including the following.
7 1. It replaces the phrases "substance abuse test" and "substance abuse  testing"  with 
8 "substance use test" and  "substance use testing" to reflect  current usage.
9 2. It repeals  a section  of law that addresses nuclear  power plants  since there are no 
10 operating nuclear  power plants in this State.
11 3. It narrows  the definition  of "employee"  and provides that a full-time  employee is 
12 an employee who works at least 36 hours a week.
13 4. It authorizes an employer that has employees subject to a federally  mandated 
14 substance use testing program  to extend federal drug testing activities to its entire 
15 workforce in order to maintain  a single  testing program and specifies  that the employer  
16 must prepare a substance use testing plan for employees  who are not federally regulated, 
17 provide a copy  of the plan to the employees  and the Department of Labor  before testing, 
18 follow federal  notification and procedural  protocols  for such employees and annually 
19 report the results of testing to  the department.
20 5. It streamlines the current substance use testing policy approval by requiring the 
21 Department of Labor to develop  a uniform impairment and substance use testing policy  
22 applicable to all employers.  Employers  must certify their adoption of the policy and be 
23 approved by the  Department  of Labor prior to conducting substance  use testing.  
24 6. It removes  the "probable  cause" standard and replaces it with an "impairment 
25 detection" standard required before the employer  may conduct  substance  use testing.  For 
26 employers authorized to conduct  substance use testing, only an employer or employee 
27 approved for impairment detection by the Department of Labor or a licensed physician or 
28 nurse may make  an impairment  detection.  This detection may be based  on a single work-
29 related accident, unlike the "probable cause" standard under current  law. The employer 
30 may immediately remove the employee from  the workplace pending resolution of the 
31 impairment detection.  
32 7.  It adds an "impairment determination" process that may be used as an alternative 
33 or in addition to a substance  use test.  Under this process,  an occupational health  care 
34 provider conducts  a medical  review in order to confirm the impairment  detection,  which 
35 may include a substance use test that includes  testing for prescription  drugs.  If the 
36 impairment is confirmed, the employer may take employment  action including firing  or 
37 disciplining the employee, subject  to any limitations under  the Maine Human Rights Act 
38 and any other state or federal law.  If the occupational health  care provider  finds that the 
39 employee was not impaired  or that such impairment  did not pose a safety risk, the 
40 employee is entitled to full reinstatement to the employee's position.
Page 25 - 128LR2645(01)-11 8. It adds a violation of an established drug-free  workplace policy as grounds for 
2 employment action and provides for a treatment period of 12 weeks  at the employee's 
3 expense.
4 9. It eliminates the requirement  that, prior to establishing a substance use testing 
5 program, an employer with over 20 full-time employees have a functioning employee 
6 assistance program and instead authorizes employers to have an employee assistance 
7 program.
8 10. It expands the number of establishments that may undertake companywide 
9 random substance  use testing by authorizing  such testing for companies with 10 or more 
10 employees instead  of with 50  or more employees,  as is the current standard.
11 11.  It provides that a confirmed positive substance use test may be reported  to the 
12 employee only by a medical review  officer  and allows an employee to provide a 
13 legitimate medical  explanation for a positive test result for legally  obtained  medications, 
14 preventing the medical  review officer from reporting a positive  test for that substance to 
15 the employer.
16 12. It allows testing  laboratories to use federal testing standards.
17 13. It adds a new civil violation for any employer noncompliance  with the substance  
18 use testing  laws, for which a fine of not more than $500 for the first violation, $750 for 
19 the 2nd violation and $1,000 for the  3rd and subsequent violations  may be adjudged.
