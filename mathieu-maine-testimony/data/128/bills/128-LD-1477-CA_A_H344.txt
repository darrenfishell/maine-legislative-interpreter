13 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,A "to H.P. 1016, L.D. 1477 
1. It provides that the Maine Human Rights Commission may provide its sexual 
harassment workplace poster at no cost to employers, instead of being required to do so. 
2. It replaces the requirement that the Maine Human Rights Commission provide 
employers with a training guide and instead directs the Department of Labor to develop a 
compliance checklist and post it on the department1s website. Employers must use the 
checklist to develop their required sexual harassment training program. Employers must 
keep a record of the training, including a record of employees who have received the 
required training, must maintain training records for 3 years and must make such records 
available to the department for inspection. 
3. It removes the provision that would have prevented the Maine Human Rights 
Commission from challenging a determination or completed enforcement action by the 
Department of Labor related to the sexual harassment training requirements and provides 
that such actions do not limit or affect the authority or jurisdiction of the commission.
