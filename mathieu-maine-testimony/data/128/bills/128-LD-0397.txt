A.  If the General Fund appropriation for the state contribution for general purpose 4

supplement the state contribution.  These supplemental funds must be used to enable 7 
the State to meet the ann ual target established by section 15752 or to decrease the 8 
amount by which state funding from all other sources falls short of the target.  The 9 
commissioner shall announce the increased state contribution amounts made possible 10 
by the supplemental amounts o btained from the fund within 14 days after final 11

SUMMARY  20 
This bill provides that the supplemental revenue funds allocated to school 21

reven ue contribution funds per pupil regardless of the local cost share expectation 26
