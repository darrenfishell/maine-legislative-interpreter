Clarify the Application of the Statute of Limitations under Article 3 -A of the Uniform 
Commercial Code" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
1Sec. 1. 14 MRSA ยง751, as amended by PL 1965, c. 306, ยง30, is further amended 
to read: 
ยง751. Twenty years 
Except as provided in Title 11, seetioo sections 2-725 and 3-1118, subsection (1), 
personal actions on contracts or liabilities under seal, promissory notes signed in the 
presence of an attesting witness, or on the bills, notes or other evidences of debt issued by 
a bank ooall must be commenced within 20 years after the cause of action accrues. 
Sec. 2. Application. This Act applies to negotiable instruments executed on or 
after the effective date of this Act.1 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. Like the bill, it clarifies that the 6-year statute of 
limitations included in Article 3-A of the Uniform Commercial Code, not the 20-year 
statute of limitations in Title 14, section 751, applies to all negotiable instruments. 
This amendment includes language to specifically apply the language to negotiable 
instruments executed on or after the effective date of this legislation. Negotiable 
instruments executed before the effective date are governed by the current law.
