Fiscal Note 
Increased eligibility to purchase enhances probability of sale 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law'allows certain state property to be sold only to nonprofit organizations who agree to use the property for 
transitional housing for veterans. Adding public-private pa1tnerships to eligible purchasers and adding substance 
abuse for veterans to the allowable uses of the property may increase the probability of a sale and increase the 
probability that sales proceeds are credited to the Capital Construction and Improvement Reserve Fund within the 
Bureau of General Services within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.
