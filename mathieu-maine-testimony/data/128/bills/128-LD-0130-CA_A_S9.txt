This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations totaling $71,288 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $24,046 in 
fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation for the cost associated with requiring 
individuals practicing midwifery in the State to be licensed by January 1, 2020. Of that amount, $67,808 and 
$20,989 in fiscal years 2017-18 and 2018-19, respectively, are allocated to the Licensing and Enforcement program 
for the per diem and All Other costs associated with adding 2 members to the Board of Complementary Health Care 
Providers and for contracted staffing services to assist the board in establishing the new licensing requirement for 
individuals practicing midwifery in the State. Additionally, $3,480 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $3,057 in fiscal year 
2018-19 are allocated to the Administrative Services Division for the service center and ST A-CAP charges. 
This fiscal note assumes that the Board of Complementary Health Care Providers will be ready to accept and process 
applications for the Ii censure of ce1tified midwives and certified professional midwives during fiscal year 2017-18 
and that 20 midwives will submit the required information and fees before June 30, 2018. This fiscal note also 
assumes an additional 16 midwives will apply for licensure in fiscal year 2018-19. The estimated increase in 
dedicated revenues to the Board of Complementary Health Care Providers from licensing and other fees are $13,920 
and $24,636 in fiscal years 2017-18 and 2018-19, respectively. This estimate assumes licensing and renewal fees are 
established at the $675 annual cap and that fees for background checks are $21 per applicant. 
LRl 183(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 2 
Because revenues from licensing fees and other fees are not expected to be sufficient to support the additional costs 
to the board in fiscal year 2017-18, General Fund support will be required. This bill includes language that requires 
the State Controller to transfer $57,368 in fiscal year 2017-18 from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to 
the Licensing and Enforcement program, Other Special Revenue Funds account, within the Department of 
Professional and Financial Regulation, no later than October 15, 2017 to fund a portion of the first year costs of this
