Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3152 -A is enacted to read:  23 
§3152 -A.  Policy and findings  24 
1.  State energy policy.  The Legislature declares that the primary energy policy of 25 
the State is to reduce electric rates and costs for businesses and households in the State 26 
and to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Title 38, section 576 27 
cost-effectively and to the maximum extent practicable.  28 
2.  Increased efficiency.  The Legislature declares and finds that improvements in 29 
transmission and distribution utility rate design and related regulatory programs have 30 
great potential for reducing the cost of electric utility services to consumers, for 31 
encouraging energy conservation and efficient use of exis ting facilities and for 32 
minimizing the need for expensive new electric transmission capacity.  It is the purpose 33 
of this chapter to:  34 
A.  Require the commission to relate transmission and distribution rates more closely 35 
to the costs of providing transmissio n and distribution service;  36 
B.  Require the commission to consider the ability of low -income residential 37 
customers to pay in full for electric services as transmission and distribution rates are 38 
redesigned consistent with these policies; and  39 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR2211(01) -1 
 C.  Require th e commission to set rates to the extent practicable to achieve economic 1 
efficiency.  2 
Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub -§1, as amended by PL 1999, c. 398, Pt. I, §1, is 3 
repealed.  4

affected by §10, is further amended to read:  8 
1.  Geographic extension.  Involves a logical geographic extension of the currently 9 
designated expedited permitting area, except that the addition of a specified place that 10 
was previously removed from the expedited permitting area in accordance with section 11 
3453 -A, subsection 1 need not satisfy this requirement; and 12 
Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §3453, sub -§2, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 13

1.  Monitoring.  The commission shall mon itor, to the extent possible through 19 
readily available information, the level of solar energy development in the State in 20 
relation to the goals in section 3474 , basic trends in solar energy markets and the likely 21 
relative costs and benefits for ratepayers from solar energy development, including but 22 
not limited to minimizing peak load on transmission and distribution systems and the 23 
energy market price of electricity and natural gas during the peak hours.  24 
Sec. 11.  35-A MRSA §3474, as enacted by PL 2013, c.  562, §1, is repealed.  25 
SUMMARY  26 
This bill changes the State's energy goals to establish that the primary objectives of 27 
the State's energy policy are to reduce electric rates and costs and to reduce air pollution.  28 
It repeals state policies and goals related  to energy generation from renewable resources 29 
and to wind energy development.  30
