SUMMARY 
This amendment revises definitions to accommodate practices in Maine with regard 
to certain guardians and with regard to small estates. 
The definition of "conservator" is amended to include a guardian when the guardian 
is exercising the powers of a conservator because no conservator has been appointed. To 
be consistent, the definition of "protected person" is amended to include a person for 
whom a guardian has been appointed when no conservator has been appointed.
