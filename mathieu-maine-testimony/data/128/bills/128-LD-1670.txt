3 2.  Sufficient existing relationship.  "Sufficient existing relationship" means  a 
4 relationship involving  extraordinary contact between a grandparent and a child, including 
5 but not limited to the following  circumstances:
6 A.  The grandparent satisfies the standard for de facto  parentage set forth  in section  
7 1891, subsection 3; or
8 B.  The grandparent has been a primary caregiver and custodian of the child for a 
9 significant period  of time.
10 Sec. 2.  19-A  MRSA §1803, sub-§1,  as enacted  by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and

20 D.  The absence of contact between the grandparent  and the child will substantially 
21 and negatively affect the child; or
22 E.  Any other compelling  state interest justifies the court's interference with the 
23 parent's fundamental right to deny  the grandparent access  to the child.
24 Sec. 3.  19-A MRSA §1803, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2005, c. 360, §3, is 
25 further amended  to read:

28 A.  The A grandparent must  seeking rights of visitation or access shall file with the

2 grandparent, serving  all parties  to the  proceeding  with a  copy .
3 C.  The court shall determine on the basis of the petition  pleadings and the affidavit 
4 affidavits under paragraphs A and B whether it is more likely than not that there is a 
5 sufficient existing  relationship or, if a sufficient  relationship does not exist, that a 
6 sufficient effort to establish  one has been made the grandparent has presented prima 
7 facie evidence  of standing  under subsection  1.  The court  may in its sole discretion,  if

20 3.  Best interest of the child.  The court may grant  a grandparent reasonable  rights of 
21 visitation or access to a minor  child  upon finding that the grandparent has standing under 
22 subsection 1 and that granting the grandparent reasonable rights of visitation or access are 
23 is in the best interest of the child and would not significantly  interfere  with any 
24 parent-child relationship  or with the parent's rightful authority  over the child.  In applying  
25 this standard deciding whether granting  the grandparent  reasonable rights of visitation or 
26 access is in the best interest of the child and whether  it would significantly interfere with 
27 the parent- child relationship  or with the parent's  rightful authority over the child, the court  
28 shall consider the  following factors:
29 A.  The  age of the child;
30 B.  The relationship of the child with the child's grandparents, including the amount

37 F.  The motivation  of the parties involved  and their capacities to give the child love,  
38 affection and guidance;
39 G.  The  child's adjustment to the child's present home,  school and community;
40 H.  The capacity of the parent and grandparent  to cooperate or to learn to cooperate in 
41 child care;
Page 3 - 128LR2537(01)-11 I.  Methods of assisting cooperation and resolving disputes and each person's 
2 willingness to use those methods;
3 J.  Any other factor having  a reasonable  bearing on the physical and psychological 
4 well-being of  the child; and
5 K.  The existence  of a grandparent's  conviction for a sex offense or a sexually violent  
6 offense as  those terms are defined in Title  34-A, section 11203.
7 Sec. 5.  19-A MRSA  §1804, first ¶, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and 
8 affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:
9 The court  may refer  the parties to mediation at any time after the petition is filed a 
10 court determination pursuant to section 1803, subsection  2, paragraph C that the 
11 grandparent has standing and may require  that the parties have made a good faith effort to 
12 mediate the issue  before  holding a hearing.  If the court finds that either  party  failed to 
13 make a good faith effort  to mediate,  the court may order the parties  to submit to 
14 mediation, dismiss the action  or any part of the action, render a decision  or judgment by 
15 default, assess attorney's fees and costs or impose any other sanction that is appropriate in 
16 the circumstances.  The court may also impose an appropriate  sanction upon a party's 
17 failure without good cause to appear for mediation after receiving  notice of the scheduled 
18 time for  mediation.
19 Sec. 6.  19-A MRSA §1806 is  enacted to read:
20 §1806.  Other  actions
21 Nothing in this chapter limits a grandparent's ability  to file any action not governed  
22 by the provisions of this chapter with respect to a child, including but not limited  to an 
23 action to establish de facto parentage  of a child under section 1891 and an action for 
24 guardianship of a  child under  Title  18-A, Article 5.
25 SUMMARY
26 This bill amends the Grandparents  Visitation Act to alleviate the constitutional 
27 concerns raised by the Law Court in Dorr v. Woodard, 2016 ME 79, 140 A.3d 467.  
28 Specifically, the bill:
29 1.  Requires  that a grandparent  seeking  access to or visitation  with a child under  the 
30 Grandparents Visitation Act demonstrate  standing to proceed  at the outset of the case 
31 through a procedure  that more  closely  tracks the procedure for demonstrating  standing to 
32 obtain de  facto parentage of a child under  the Maine Parentage Act;
33 2.  Amends the substantive  test for a grandparent's standing by defining  the type of 
34 sufficient existing relationship  that must  exist  between  a grandparent and a child and by 
35 eliminating the automatic standing granted under current  law to a grandparent when  one 
36 of the child's parents or legal guardians has  died;
37 3.  Prohibits a court from  ordering  the parties to engage in mediation  prior  to a court  
Page 4 - 128LR2537(01)-11 determination that a grandparent  has made a prima  facie showing of standing; and
2 4.  Clarifies that a grandparent's ability to file an action for de facto  parentage or for 
3 guardianship of a  child is not limited  by the  Grandparents Visitation Act.
