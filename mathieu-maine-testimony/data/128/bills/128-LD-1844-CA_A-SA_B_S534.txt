16 appropriate tax measures in order to protect this unique economic and recreational

21 participant in timber operations, the State has an active interest in ensuring that large 
22 parcels of land that the State has subsidized remain available for logging and recreational 
23 activities, if feasible. 
24 It is the intent of the Legislature to further the purpose of this sub chapter by acquiring, so 
25 far as is prac.ticable and appropriate, significant forest land that is being sold, to ensure 
26 the protectioii of this economic and recreational state resource.'
