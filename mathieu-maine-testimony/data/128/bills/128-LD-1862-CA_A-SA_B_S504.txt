13 This amendment strikes from Committee Amendment "A" language that reduces by 
$80,000 the municipal cost component submitted by Aroostook County to remove 
funding for a half-time deputy sheriff position and a vehicle; instead, this amendment 
reduces that municipal cost component by $45,000 to remove only the funding for the 
vehicle. 
This amendment also requires the administrator of Aroostook County to reimburse 
the fiscal administrator of the unorganized territory for the time that the half-time deputy 
sheriff position provides services directly to the organized municipalities in Aroostook 
County, as determined by the Aroostook County administrator.
