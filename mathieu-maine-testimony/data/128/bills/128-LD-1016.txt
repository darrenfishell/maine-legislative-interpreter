 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §15688 -A, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. C, 2 
§10, is repealed.  3 
Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §15688 -B is enacted to read:  4 
§15688 -B.  Career and technical education costs  5 
The c ommissioner shall expend and disburse funds to the appropriate school 6 
administrative unit or career and technical education region for career and technical 7 
education in accordance with this section.  The commissioner shall take into account any 8 
new or expa nded career and technical education programs proposed to be offered by a 9 
school administrative unit and calculate, expend and disburse funding under this section 10 
based on the projected costs for the projected enrollment in career and technical 11 
education an d not on the enrollment or costs in the current or a previous fiscal year.  The 12 
allocation for career and technical education must be based upon a program -driven model 13 
that considers components for direct instruction, central administration, supplies, 14 
operation and maintenance of plant, other student and staff support and equipment for the 15 
projected enrollment for the fiscal year of the allocation.  The commissioner shall consult 16 
with the school board of the school administrative unit or the cooperative boa rd of the 17 
career and technical education region in determining the projected enrollment in career 18 
and technical education.  Monthly payments must be made directly to school 19 
administrative units with career and technical education centers and directly to ca reer and 20 
technical education regions. If a school administrative unit with a career and technical 21 
education center or a career and technical education region has any unexpended funds at 22 
the end of the fiscal year, these funds must be carried forward for th e purposes of career 23 
and technical education.  24 
SUMMARY  25 
This bill modifies the funding model for career and technical education costs.  This 26 
bill requires that the state allocation for these costs be based on the projected enrollment 27 
for the fiscal year of t he allocation rather than actual enrollment in a prior year.  28
