SUMMARY  18 
This bill changes the Lincoln County budget procedures in the following ways.  19 
1.  Current law requires an interim county budget before a final county budget is 20 
approved to be no more than 80% of the amount of the preceding county budget.  This 21 
bill raises the level of the interim county budget to no more than the full amount of the 22 
preceding county budget.  23 
2.  Current law requires the Lincoln County Budget Advisory Commit tee to be 24 
comprised of 3 municipal officers per county commissioner district elected by their 25 
respective district caucuses and serving staggered 3 -year terms.  This bill requires that 26 
each municipality has the option to have one municipal officer from that  municipality 27 
selected by the municipality’s governing body to serve on the committee for a one -year 28 
term.  29 
3.  Current law requires the committee to submit budget recommendations to the 30 
Lincoln County commissioners, who have the final say on the county bud get.  This bill 31 
gives the committee the authority to submit a budget to the commissioners, who need a 32 
unanimous vote to make any changes, and the power to veto any change to the budget by 33 
the commissioners by a 2/3 vote of the committee members present.  34
