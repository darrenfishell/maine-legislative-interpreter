5 period in  order  to facilitate the delivery  of propane  this winter;  and
6 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
7 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
8 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
9 therefore,
10 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
11 Sec. 1.  10 MRSA §1658-A, sub-§2,  as enacted  by PL 1991, c. 770, §1, is 
12 amended to read:
13 2.  Unlawful use of containers.  No Except as provided in subsection 3, a person  
14 except other  than the owner, or a person authorized in writing by the owner to do so, may 
15 not fill or refill  a liquefied petroleum  gas container with a liquefied petroleum  gas or any 
16 other gas or substance.
17 Sec. 2.  10 MRSA  §1658-A,  sub-§3  is enacted  to read:
18 3.  Propane fill or refill during emergencies.  When the Governor has issued an 
19 emergency declaration  relating to heating fuel shortages for the purpose  of facilitating the 
20 granting of a waiver from  the United States  Department of Transportation,  Federal Motor 
21 Carrier Safety  Administration  to allow relief from 49 Code of Federal  Regulations, Parts 
22 390 to 399, a person who is not the owner  of a liquefied petroleum gas container may fill 
23 or refill that container  with propane  during the period for which the emergency is 
24 declared if  the owner authorizes  that person to fill or refill the container.
25 An owner that authorizes a person to fill or refill a container pursuant to this subsection  is 
26 not liable  for any injury  or damage that results from an action  of that person  while that 
27 person is filling or refilling that container pursuant to this subsection.  A person  who fills 
28 or refills a container  pursuant to this subsection is not liable  for any injury or damage that 
29 results from  the condition of the container.
30 Nothing in this subsection  may be construed to require  a person  who is authorized by an 
31 owner to fill or refill a  container  pursuant to this subsection to fill or refill that container.
32 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
33 legislation takes effect when  approved.
34 SUMMARY
35 This bill allows a person  who is not the owner  of a liquefied petroleum gas container 
36 to fill or refill  that container  with propane  during  the period  for which the Governor  has 
37 issued an emergency  declaration relating to heating fuel shortages, if the owner of the 
Page 2 - 128LR2847(01)-11 container authorizes that person to fill or refill the container.   The bill does not require a 
2 person who is authorized  by an owner to fill or refill a liquefied petroleum gas container 
3 to fill or refill that container.  The bill provides  a limitation of liability for the liquefied 
4 petroleum gas  container owner and the person  who fills or refills the  container.
