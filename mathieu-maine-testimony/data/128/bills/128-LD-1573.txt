SUBCHAPTER 3  3 
MAINE TIMBER  4 
ยง1777.  Legislative findings  5 
1.  Findings.  The Legislature finds and declares that:  6 
A.  The forested lands in Main e provide the source of raw materials for the timber 7 
products industry and jobs for persons who are employed in that industry;  8 
B.  Forested lands in Maine are an essential economic resource in rural communities 9 
across the State, and the economic pressures faced by the timber industry have 10 
resulted in financial losses to the Maine timber products industry;  11 
C.  The State has a legitimate interest in stating a preference that funds associated 12 
with its purchase of timber and its subsidization of timber harvesti ng and hauling be 13 
recycled through the local state economy; and  14 
D.  When price, quality and fitness are equal and when the marketplace provides 15 
timber that meets the State's needs for its own consumption, it is appropriate for the 16 
State to support the econ omic vitality of the Maine timber products industry by 17 
purchasing Maine timber.  18
