Page 1 - 128LR2641(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the State's  biennial  budget was enacted and signed into law as an 
4 emergency measure  on July 4, 2017; and
5 Whereas, the biennial budget made changes  to the laws governing  unemployment 
6 compensation, and this legislation makes changes  to those laws that are necessary for 
7 their proper administration; and
8 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
11 therefore,
12 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
13 Sec. 1.  26 MRSA  §1221, sub-§3, ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. 
14 CCCCC, §2, is further  amended to read:
15 A.  At the time the status of an employing unit is ascertained to be that of an 
16 employer, the commissioner shall  establish and maintain, until the employer  status is 
17 terminated, for the employer an experience  rating record, to which  are credited all the 
18 contributions that the employer pays on the employer's own behalf.  This chapter may 
19 not be construed to grant any employer  or individuals in the employer's  service prior  
20 claims or rights to the amounts  paid by the employer into the fund.   Benefits paid to 
21 an eligible individual under the Employment Security Law must be charged  against 
22 the experience rating  record of the claimant's most  recent subject employer,  except 
23 that, beginning January 1, 2018 2020, benefits paid to an eligible  individual under  the 
24 Employment Security  Law must be charged against the experience  rating  record of 
25 the claimant's employers  in inverse chronological  order in a ratio inversely 
26 proportional to the claimant's employment beginning with the most recent employer  
27 in the base period, or to the General Fund if the otherwise chargeable experience 
28 rating record  is that of an employer  whose status as such has been terminated; except 
29 that no charge may be made  to an individual employer but must  be made to the 
30 General Fund if the  commission  finds that:
31 (1)  The claimant's  separation from the claimant's last employer  was for 
32 misconduct in connection  with the claimant's employment or was voluntary 
33 without good cause attributable to the employer;
34 (2)  The claimant  has refused to accept  reemployment in suitable  work when 
35 offered by a previous  employer, without good cause  attributable to the  employer;
36 (3)  Benefits  paid are not chargeable against any employer's experience  rating  
37 record in accordance  with  section  1194, subsection 11, paragraphs B  and C;
38 (5)  Reimbursements are made to a state,  the Virgin  Islands or Canada for 
39 benefits paid to a claimant under a reciprocal benefits arrangement as authorized 
40 in section 1082,  subsection  12, as long as the wages of the claimant  transferred  to 
Page 2 - 128LR2641(01)-11 the other state, the Virgin Islands or Canada  under such an arrangement  are less 
2 than the amount of wages for insured work required for benefit purposes by 
3 section 1192, subsection 5;
4 (6)  The claimant was hired  by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
5 open by a Legislator given  a leave  of absence under chapter  7, subchapter 5-A, 
6 and the claimant's separation from this employer  was because the employer  
7 restored the Legislator  to the position  after the Legislator's leave of absence as 
8 required by chapter 7, subchapter 5-A;
9 (7)  The claimant was hired  by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
10 open by an individual  who left to enter active duty in the United  States military, 
11 and the claimant's separation from this employer  was because the employer  
12 restored the military serviceperson to the person's former employment  upon 
13 separation from military  service;
14 (8)  The claimant was hired  by the claimant's last employer to fill a position left 
15 open by an individual given  a leave  of absence for family medical leave provided  
16 under Maine  or federal law, and the claimant's separation from  this employer was 
17 because the employer restored the individual to the position at the completion  of 
18 the leave; or
19 (9)  The claimant  initiated a partial separation  or reduction of hours and that 
20 partial separation or reduction of hours was agreed to by the employee and 
21 employer.
22 Sec. 2.  26 MRSA  §1221, sub-§3, ¶C-2 is  enacted to read:
23 C-2.  For the purposes of paragraph A, the experience  rating record of the most recent 
24 subject employer may not be charged with benefits paid to a claimant whose work 
25 record with that employer totaled 5 consecutive weeks  or less of total or partial 
26 employment; in that case the most  recent subject employer with whom the claimant's 
27 work record exceeded 5 consecutive weeks of total or partial employment  must be 
28 charged if that employer  would have otherwise been chargeable had not subsequent 
29 employment intervened.   This  paragraph is  repealed January 1, 2020.
30 Sec. 3.  26 MRSA §1221, sub-§4-A, ¶C, as amended by PL 2007, c. 352, Pt. A, 
31 §2, is further amended to read:
32 C.  The commissioner shall:
33 (1)  Promptly notify each employer of the employer's  rate of contributions  as 
34 determined for the 12-month period commencing January 1st of each year.   The 
35 determination is conclusive and binding upon the employer unless within 30 days 
36 after notice of the determination is mailed to the employer's last known address  
37 or, in the absence of mailing, within 30 days after the delivery of the notice,  the 
38 employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the 
39 employer's reasons.   If the commission  Division of Administrative Hearings 
40 grants the review, the employer must be promptly notified and must be granted 
41 an opportunity  for a hearing.  An employer  does not have  standing  in any 
42 proceedings involving the employer's  rate of contributions or contribution  
Page 3 - 128LR2641(01)-11 liability to contest the chargeability to the employer's experience  rating  record of 
2 any benefits paid in accordance  with a determination, redetermination or decision  
3 pursuant to section  1194, except upon the ground that the services for which  
4 benefits were  found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in 
5 employment for the employer and only when  the employer was not a party  to the 
6 determination, redetermination  or decision  or to any other  proceedings under  this 
7 chapter in which the character of the services was determined.  The employer 
8 must be promptly notified of the commission's Division of Administrative  
9 Hearings' denial of the employer's application  or the commission's Division of 
10 Administrative Hearings'  redetermination,  both of which are subject  to appeal 
11 pursuant to Title 5, chapter  375, subchapter  7; and
12 (2)  Provide  each employer at least monthly with a notification of benefits paid 
13 and chargeable  to the employer's experience rating  record.  In the absence of an 
14 application for redetermination  filed in the manner  and within the period 
15 prescribed by the commission commissioner , a notification is conclusive and 
16 binding upon the employer  for all purposes.   A redetermination  made after notice  
17 and opportunity  for hearing and the commission's Division of Administrative 
18 Hearings' findings of fact may be introduced in subsequent administrative or 
19 judicial proceedings involving the determination of the rate of contributions of an 
20 employer for the 12-month period commencing January  1st of any year and has 
21 the same finality as provided in this section with respect to the findings of fact 
22 made by the commission Division of Administrative Hearings in proceedings to 
23 redetermine the contribution  rates  of an employer.
24 Sec. 4.  26 MRSA §1221,  sub-§11,  ¶D, as amended by PL 1979, c. 651, §28, is 
25 further amended  to read:
26 D.  The amount due specified in any assessment  from  the commissioner  shall  be is 
27 conclusive on the employer or governmental entity, unless not later than 15 days after 
28 the assessment was mailed  to the last known address, the employer or governmental  
29 entity files an application  for redetermination by the commission Division  of 
30 Administrative Hearings setting  forth  the grounds for such application.
31 Sec. 5.  26 MRSA §1225, sub-§2,  as amended by PL 1993, c. 312, §3, is further 
32 amended to read:
33 2.  Jeopardy assessment.  If the Director of Unemployment Compensation  
34 determines that the collection  of any contribution, interest or penalty under this 
35 subchapter, as amended,  will be jeopardized by delay, the director  may immediately 
36 assess the contributions, interest  or penalties,  whether or not the time prescribed by law or 
37 any rules issued pursuant  to section 1082, subsection 2, for making reports and paying  the 
38 contributions has expired,  and shall  give written notice of the assessment  to the employer.  
39 In these cases, the right to appeal to the commission Division  of Administrative Hearings, 
40 as provided in section  1226, is conditioned upon payment  of the contributions,  interest  or 
41 penalties so assessed,  or upon giving appropriate security  to the commissioner for the 
42 payment thereof.
Page 4 - 128LR2641(01)-11 Sec. 6.  26 MRSA §1232, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 312, §5, is amended 
2 to read:
3 2.  Failure  to file or pay taxes; determination to prevent renewal,  reissuance or 
4 other extension  of license or certificate.  If the commissioner determines  that an 
5 employer who holds  a state- issued license or certificate of authority to conduct a 
6 profession, trade or business has failed to file a return at the time required  under  this 
7 chapter or has failed to pay a tax liability  due under this chapter that has been demanded, 
8 and the employer continues  to fail to file or pay after at least 2 specific written  requests  to 
9 do so, the commissioner shall notify  the employer  in writing by certified mail, return  
10 receipt requested,  that refusal to file the required tax return or to pay the overdue tax 
11 liability may result in loss of license  or certificate of authority.
12 This written notice must include  information about the opportunity to request  a fact-
13 finding interview for the purpose of determining essential facts,  negotiating  a payment  
14 agreement and determining the appropriateness of further  enforcement under this section.
15 If the employer requests a fact-finding interview  within 30 days, the commissioner shall 
16 schedule the interview at which the commissioner  shall attempt  to negotiate a reasonable 
17 payment agreement.  The employer must be notified  in writing if the commissioner's  
18 determination is to prevent renewal, reissuance or extension of the license  or certificate of 
19 authority by the issuing agency.  If the employer  enters into a payment agreement, a 
20 determination may not be made under this section  until the employer fails to comply  with 
21 the agreement.
22 If the employer  continues,  for a period in excess of 30 days from  notice  of possible denial 
23 of renewal or reissuance of a license  or certificate  of authority, to fail to file or show 
24 reason why the person is not required to file or if the employer continues not to pay, the 
25 commissioner shall notify the employer in writing of the determination  to prevent 
26 renewal, reissuance or extension of the license  or certificate of authority by the issuing  
27 agency.
28 A review of the determination is available by filing an appeal  under  section  1226 to the 
29 Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission Division of Administrative  Hearings.  
30 Either by failure to proceed  to the next step of appeal or by exhaustion  of the steps of 
31 appeal, the determination of the commissioner's  right  to prevent renewal or reissuance 
32 becomes final  unless otherwise determined by appeal.
33 In any event, the license or certificate of authority  in question remains in effect until all 
34 appeals are taken to their final conclusion.  This subsection  may not be invoked for any 
35 tax liability under appeal.
36 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
37 legislation takes effect when  approved.
38 SUMMARY
39 This bill changes the laws governing  how benefits paid to an eligible individual under  
40 the Employment  Security  Law are charged  against the experience rating record of the 
41 individual's previous  employers and applies these changes beginning January 1, 2020.  
Page 5 - 128LR2641(01)-11 The biennial budget also changed this law and applied the changes beginning January 1, 
2 2018.  The bill also provides that until January 1, 2020 the experience  rating record of the 
3 most recent subject employer may not be charged with benefits paid to an eligible  
4 individual whose work record with that employer  totaled 5 consecutive weeks  or less.
5 This bill also provides that certain decisions made by the Commissioner of Labor are 
6 subject to review by the Department of Labor, Division  of Administrative Hearings, 
7 rather than by the  Maine Unemployment Insurance Commission.
