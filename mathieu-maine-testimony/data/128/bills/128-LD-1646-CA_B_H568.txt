Fiscal Note 
Unbudgeted savings on delay or repeal -General Fund 
Unbudgeted savings on delay or repeal -Highway Fund 
Costs related to ranked-choice voting were estimated in the fiscal note for LD 1557 of the 127th Legislature, which 
was introduced as Initiated Bill 2 in response to a successful citizen initiated petition drive. As LD 1557 was 
indefinitely postponed, there was no opportunity to put funding for the Secretary of State (SOS) or the Department of 
Public Safety (DPS) into that bill. Subsequent approval by the voters in November of 2016 meant any funding would 
have to wait for implementing legislation. Delaying implementation of ranked-choice voting until elections held after 
December 1, 2021 will eliminate any funding that would have been required by the SOS and the DPS in the current 
biennium. As no funding has ever been budgeted, no savings will be booked on delay. 
Additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State associated with conducting an evaluation and recommending 
legislation for the administration of ranked-choice voting can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Any 
appropriations and allocations associated with implementing ranked-choice voting would need to be included within 
that subsequent legislation. If the Constitution of Maine is not amended, the laws governing ranked-choice voting are 
repealed and no funding will be required.
