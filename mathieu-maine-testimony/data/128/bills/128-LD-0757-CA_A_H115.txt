COMMITTEE AMENDMENT"{)" to H.P. 537, L.D. 757 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment adds to the bill a change to the notice requirement for proposed 
3 financing of costs greater than $30,000 from 7 days to 14 days and requires that notice be 
4 provided in a newspaper or newsletter having a general circulation in the Town of 
5 Richmond and be mailed to district voters and customers via postcard or bill insert 
6 instead of in only a newspaper. The amendment also removes a section of the Richmond 
7 Utilities District charter that allows the trustees to propose a different debt limit than in 
8 the charter and submit that proposal for districtwide approval in a referendum because the 
9 bill removes the cap on indebtedness of the district.
