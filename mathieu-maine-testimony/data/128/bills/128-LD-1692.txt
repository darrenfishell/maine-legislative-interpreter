Page 5 - 128LR2668(01)-11 SUMMARY
2 This bill increases the maximum registered weight of a vehicle eligible  for specialty 
3 plates from 10,000  pounds to 26,000 pounds.  It also makes the Motor Carrier Review  
4 Board an appellate board for decisions  of the Secretary  of State relative to motor carrier  
5 safety suspensions and clarifies that the Secretary  of State  may suspend a motor carrier 
6 with an adverse  safety history  pursuant to the methodology  the Secretary  of State adopts 
7 based on the recommendations of the board.  It removes  the requirement that specialty 
8 plates authorized after January  1, 2007 be retired after 10 years regardless of the number  
9 of active plates.   The bill also corrects an inadvertent  omission made  during the technical 
10 processing of Public Law 2017,  chapter 27.
