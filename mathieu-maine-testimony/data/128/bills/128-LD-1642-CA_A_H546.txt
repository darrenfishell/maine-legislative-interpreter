128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "f+" to H.P. 1133, L.D. 1642, Bill, "An Act To 
Clarify Licensing Provisions for the Manufacture and Sale of Liquor" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, Regarding Licensing Provisions for the Manufacture and Sale of Liquor' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the emergency preamble and before 
the emergency clause and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations prohibited 
from suspending, revoking or refusing to renew certain licenses under 
certain circumstances. Resolved: That before June 30, 2018, the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 
Operations may not suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license issued under the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 28-A, section 1355-A or Title 28-A, chapter 43 or 45 that was 
initially issued prior to June 1, 2017 solely on the basis that the establishment licensed 
under Title 28-A, chapter 43 or 45 was determined by the bureau after June 1, 2017 to not 
be exclusively held or exclusively owned by a person licensed to manufacture liquor 
under Title 28-A, section 1355-A. 
The prohibition described in this section does not apply if the reason for suspension, 
revocation or failure to renew is due to the licensee's substantial misrepresentation of or 
failure to disclose material facts required for the issuance or renewal of the license.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and replaces it with a resolve containing the 
provision that temporarily prohibits the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations from suspending, 
revoking or refusing to renew certain licenses solely based on a change in the bureau's 
interpretation of the terms "exclusively held" or "exclusively owned."
