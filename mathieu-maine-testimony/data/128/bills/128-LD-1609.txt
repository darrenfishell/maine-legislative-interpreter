2.  Tip credit.  An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 5 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 6 
established in this section.  Starting Jan uary 1, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid 7 
directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour, and the tip 8 
credit may not exceed the difference between the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 9 
tipped service employee and the minimum ho urly wage established under subsection 1.  10 
Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January 1st thereafter, the minimum cash wage 11 
paid directly to a tipped service employee must be increased by an additional $1.00 per 12 
hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage 13 
established under subsection 1, except that if the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 14 
tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less than the annually adjusted minimum 15 
hourly wage, it must be increased by that l esser amount.   An employer who elects to use 16 
the tip credit , until it is eliminated under this subsection,  must inform the affected 17 
employee in advance and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the 18 
minimum hourly wage when direct wages a nd the tip credit are combined.  Upon a 19 
satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's representative that the actual tips 20 
received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall increase the direct wages by the 21 
difference.  22 
The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 23 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 24 
bill or  that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 25 
employee.  A t ip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 26 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 27 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  28 
Sec. 10.  26 MRSA §664, sub -§2-B, as enacted by PL 2011 , c. 118, §4, is 29 
repealed and the following enacted in its place:  30 
2-B.  Service charges.  A compulsory charge for service is not a tip.  Such a charge 31 
is part of the employer's gross receipts.  Sums distributed to employees from service 32 
charges may not be counted as tips received, but may be used to satisfy the employer's 33 
minimum wage and overtime obligations.  If an employee receives tips in addition to the 34 
compulsory service charge, those tips may be considered in determining whether the 35 
employee is a tip ped employee and in the application of the tip credit.  36
