This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $28,293 in fiscal year 2017-18 to the Learning System 
program within the Department of Education to fund 90% of the costs to local school administrative units for their 
school boards to adopt policies goveming the involunta1y transfer of teachers. This estimate reflects the time that it 
may take for superintendents and administrative staff to draft and distribute the preliminary policy proposals for 
review by the boards and incorporate revisions as necessary for final approval and distribution.
