2 PART A
3 Sec. A-1.  1 MRSA §403-A is enacted  to read:
4 §403-A.  Remote participation in public proceedings
5 1.  Remote participation.  This section governs participation in a public proceeding 
6 of a body subject  to this subchapter by a member of that body when the member  is not 
7 physically present.  It is the intent of the Legislature that actions of those bodies  be taken 
8 openly and their deliberations be conducted openly.  Remote participation through  
9 telephonic, video, electronic or other  similar means of communication may not be used to 
10 defeat the  purposes  of this subchapter as stated in section 401.
11 2.  Prohibition.  Except  as provided  in subsection  3, a body  subject  to this subchapter 
12 may not allow  a member of the body to participate in any of its public  proceedings 
13 through telephonic, video, electronic  or other similar means of communication.
14 3.  Exceptions.  A member of the following  bodies may participate  in a public 
15 proceeding of the body when not physically present to the extent  authorized  in the 
16 respective statute:
17 A.  The  Finance  Authority of Maine, as  authorized in Title 10, section  971-A;
18 B.  The Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, as authorized  in 
19 Title 21-A, section 1002, subsection 2;
20 C.  The Maine Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, as authorized in 
21 Title 22, section 2054, subsection 4- A;

3 quorum to exercise all powers and perform all duties  of the members.
4 2.  Emergency meeting.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a situation 
5 determined by the chief executive officer to be an emergency requiring  action of the

34 further amended  to read:
35 4.  Powers of authority.  The powers of the authority  are vested in its members, and 
36 5 members  of the authority  constitute a quorum at any meeting of the authority.  A 
37 vacancy in the membership of the authority does not impair the right of a quorum  to 
38 exercise all the rights and perform all the duties  of the authority.  An action  taken  by the 
39 authority under this chapter may be authorized by resolution approved by a majority of 
40 the members present  at any regular  or special meeting, which resolution takes effect 
Page 3 - 128LR2891(01)-11 immediately, or an action taken by the authority may be authorized by a resolution  
2 circularized or sent to each member  of the authority, which resolution takes effect at such 
3 time as a majority of the members have signed  an assent  to such resolution.  Resolutions 
4 of the authority need not be published  or posted.  The authority may delegate by 
5 resolution to one or more of its members or its executive director such powers and duties 
6 as it considers proper.
7 The authority may meet by telephonic, video,  electronic or other similar means of

18 proceeding and who is participating through  telephonic,  video, electronic or other 
19 similar means  of communication identifies all persons  present at the location  from 
20 which the member is participating;
21 C.  A member who participates  while not physically present at the location of the 
22 public proceeding identified in the notice required  by Title 1, section 406 does so 
23 only when  the member's attendance is not reasonably practical.  The reason that the 
24 member's attendance is not reasonably practical must be stated  in the minutes of the 
25 meeting; and
26 D.  Each member who is not physically present at the location  of the public 
27 proceeding and who is participating through  telephonic,  video, electronic or other 
28 similar means of communication has received prior to the public proceeding all 
29 documents and materials discussed at the public proceeding, with substantially the 
30 same content  as those presented at the public proceeding.  Documents or other 
31 materials made available  at the public  proceeding may be transmitted  to the member 
32 not physically  present during the public proceeding if the transmission technology is 
33 available.  Failure to comply with this paragraph does not invalidate an action taken 
34 by the authority at  the public proceeding.

40 the State.   Of the 5 remaining gubernatorial appointments, the Governor shall give 
41 priority to a representative involved in the housing business and a representative  of 
42 people with disabilities.  The powers of the Maine State Housing Authority  are vested 
43 in the commissioners.  The commissioners may delegate  such powers and duties  to 
44 the director of the  Maine  State Housing Authority  as they determine appropriate.
Page 5 - 128LR2891(01)-11 The Governor shall appoint the chair of the commissioners from among the 8 
2 gubernatorial appointments.  The chair serves as a nonvoting member, except that the

5 Following reasonable  notice to each commissioner,  5 commissioners of the Maine  
6 State Housing Authority constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting its 
7 business, exercising its powers and for all other purposes, notwithstanding the

9 of a majority of the commissioners present, unless otherwise specified  in law or 
10 required by its bylaws.

22 SUMMARY
23 This bill is in response to recommendations contained in the Right To Know 
24 Advisory Committee's 12th annual report concerning remote participation  in public 
25 proceedings by members of public bodies  that are subject  to the Freedom of Access Act.  
26 The bill expressly  prohibits a member  of a body subject  to the Freedom of Access Act 
27 from participating in the body's public proceedings if the member is not physically  
28 present.
29 Part A prohibits a member of a public body from participating  in a public proceeding 
30 when that member is not physically  present at the location of the public proceeding as 
31 indicated in the required  public notice.  The members of 7 specific public bodies are 
32 currently statutorily authorized to participate remotely in the public proceedings of those  
33 bodies, and they may continue to do so as long as the statutes still authorize such 
34 participation.  The 7 bodies are the Finance Authority  of Maine,  the Commission  on 
35 Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, the Maine Health and Higher Educational 
36 Facilities Authority,  the Maine  State  Housing Authority, the Maine Municipal Bond Bank 
37 the Emergency  Medical Services' Board and the  Workers' Compensation Board.
38 Part B amends  the statutes enabling remote participation for the 7 bodies to repeal the 
39 authorization for remote participation July  1, 2020.
Page 11 - 128LR2891(01)-11 Part C amends  the Freedom of Access  Act to require the joint standing committee of 
2 the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters  to conduct a review of any 
3 proposed statutory authorization of remote participation  or change in accessibility with 
4 respect to public proceedings.
