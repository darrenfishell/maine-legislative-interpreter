Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill increases the amount of income earned by recipients of benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families program that is disregarded in determining the amount of benefits they receive. The amount of the disregard 
is lowered over time as recipients make the transition to stable employment. Sufficient data is not cunently available 
to determine what the additional cost would be, but any cost would accrue to the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Federal Block Grant Fund and would have no impact on the General Fund spending.
