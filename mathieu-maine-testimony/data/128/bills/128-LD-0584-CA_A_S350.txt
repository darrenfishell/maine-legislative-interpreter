The bill includes a base allocation of $500 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 to establish the Fund for Municipalities to 
Improve Pedestrian Safety within the Department of Transportation. It requires a transfer of the uncommitted balance 
in the Multimodal Transp01iation Fund to the new fund every year. No estimate can be made of how much would be 
available to be transfened each year going forward, but any amounts transfened would reduce the amounts available 
for the purposes of the Multimodal Transp01iation Fund in subsequent years.
