18 SUMMARY 
This bill requires persons who operate fantasy
 contests to register annually with the 
Department of Public Safety and pay a registration fee based on the gross revenues 
generated by that fantasy contest operator dur ing the 12 months prior to registration or 
renewal.  "Fantasy contest" is defined as a simulated game or contest in which one or 
more players pay an entry fee and compete for and win prizes of value based on outcomes that reflect the relative knowledge and skill of the players and that are determined 
predominantly by accumulated statistical results of the performance of individuals, 
including athletes in the case of sporting events. 
This bill regulates the operators of fantasy contests, including by prohibiting the 
fantasy contest operator, an employee of the operator or a relative of the employee in the 
same household from participating in the contests; requiring the outcome to be based on 
more than just a score or point spread of a single game or contest; allowing an individual, 
on that individual's request to the operator,  to be barred from playing in the contest; 
requiring the operator to provide notice of th e prizes prior to the contest; and requiring 
the operator to establish a separate reserve account for the payment of prizes. 
Finally, the bill exempts fantasy contests from the laws prohibiting games of chance 
and gambling.
