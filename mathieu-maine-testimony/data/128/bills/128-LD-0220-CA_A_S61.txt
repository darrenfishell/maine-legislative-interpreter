Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Aligning the time limits for General Assistance (GA) with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program 
(T ANF) will reduce assistance payments made by municipalities and reduce amounts reimbursed to municipalities by 
the Department of Health and Human Services. The potential savings to the department is not expected to be 
significant because recipients typically do not stay in the program, having to reapply each month they seek help. A 
more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible because recipient data related to number of months on 
assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number of recipients who return and the frequency of an individual 
reaching the lifetime TANF limit also accessing GA resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
