Allow Promotional Allowances by Public Utilities " 
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'An Act To Allow Promotional Allowances by Gas Utilities' 
13 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
14 summary and inserting the following: 
15 'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA ยง4706-C is enacted to read: 
16 ยง4706-C. Promotional allowances 
17 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
18 following terms have the following meanings. 
19 A. "Promotional allowance" means any rebate, discount, credit or other promotion 
20 offered or provided by a gas utility to customers or potential customers for the 
21 purpose of encouraging customers or potential customers to select or use the service 
22 or increase usage of the service of that utility; to select, purchase, install or use any 
23 appliance or equipment designed to use that utility's service; or to use any other 
24 particular service of that utility. 
25 2. Promotional allowance allowed. Notwithstanding sections 302-A and 703, a gas 
26 utility, without prior notice or approval from the commission, may offer or provide a 
27 promotional allowance. 
28 3. Filing of schedules of rates. Notwithstanding section 307, schedules of rates that 
29 provide for promotional allowances take effect when filed with the commission, unless a 
30 later effective date is specified in the filing. A copy of the filing must also be provided 
31 simultaneously to the Efficiency Maine Trust, established in chapter 97. 
32 4. Rate-making treatment. This section does not limit the commission's authority

1 unwarranted. A gas utility may not recover from any person other than its shareholders or 
2 other owners any expenditures, contributions, expenses or costs incurred by that utility 
3 with respect to promotional allowances.' 
4 SUMMARY 
5 This amendment replaces the bill. It allows a gas utility to offer a promotional 
6 allowance, instead of a public utility as proposed in the bill, and the rate for that 
7 promotional allowance takes effect when the schedule of rates is filed with the Public 
8 Utilities Commission and provided to the Efficiency Maine Trust, unless a later effective 
9 date is specified. A gas utility does not need to provide prior notice or receive approval 
10 from the commission in order to offer a promotional allowance.
