appointed pursuant to this section, and any vacancy caused by death or resignation must 22 
be filled by election or appointment by the municipal officers within 30 days. For each 23 
month that the municipal officers neglect their duty, they severally are subject to a fine of 24 
$10. Within 10 days after each such election or appointment, the clerk of each 25 
municipality shall communicate the name of the person so elected or appointed to the 26 
state sealer and for neglect of this duty is subject to a fine of $10. A sealer of weights and 27 
measures in any municipality may be sealer for several municipalities, if such is the 28 
pleasure of the municipal officers of those municipalities, as long as this action receives 29
