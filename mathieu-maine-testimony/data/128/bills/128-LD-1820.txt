Page 1 - 128LR2811(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted for a rate study 
4 for MaineCare rehabilitative and community  support services for children with cognitive 
5 impairments and functional limitations under department  rule Chapter  101:  MaineCare 
6 Benefits Manual,  Chapter III, Section 28, which was performed by Burns & Associates,  
7 Inc. and  which recommended rate  increases for  certain  services covered by that rule; and
8 Whereas, the recommended  rate increases have not been  implemented  because the 
9 department has not proposed a rule  amendment to put the increased rates into effect;  and
10 Whereas, Public Law 2017, chapter 284, Part SSSSSSS, section 1 places  a 
11 moratorium on decreases in rates for these services  but does not prohibit rate increases; 
12 and
13 Whereas, the providers  of these services  are in need  of the recommended  rate 
14 increases because, as shown in the rate study, current rates  do not cover costs that must be 
15 met in order  for providers to continue  to offer these services; and
16 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
17 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
18 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
19 therefore, be it
20 Sec. 1.  Department of Health and Human Services to increase 
21 MaineCare rates.   Resolved:  That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
22 later than April 1, 2018, the Department  of Health  and Human Services shall amend rule 
23 Chapter 101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Section  28 to increase 
24 reimbursement rates for children's  habilitative services and specialized children's 
25 habilitative services in accordance with the April 24, 2017 report "Rate Study for 
26 Behavioral Health and Targeted Case Management Services:  Final Proposed Rates  for 
27 Formal Rulemaking" prepared for the department by Burns & Associates,  Inc.  Rules 
28 adopted pursuant  to this section  are major substantive rules pursuant to the Maine  
29 Revised Statutes,  Title  5, chapter 375, subchapter  2-A.
30 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
31 legislation takes effect when  approved.
32 SUMMARY

34 substantive rules amending rule Chapter  101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter  III,
