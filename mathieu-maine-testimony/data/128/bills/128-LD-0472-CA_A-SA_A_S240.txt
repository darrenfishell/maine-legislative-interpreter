STATE OF MAINE 
SENATE 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT " A " to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 335, 
L.D. 472, Bill, "An Act Regarding Parental Rights" 
Amend the amendment by striking out all of section 1 (page 1, lines 13 to 25 in 
amendment) and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง4003-A is enacted to read: 
ยง4003-A. Rights of parents 
1. Parents joint natural guardians of children. The parents are the joint natural 
guardians of their minor children and are jointly entitled to the care, custody, control, 
services and earnings of their children. Neither parent has any rights paramount to the 
rights of the other with reference to any matter affecting their children. 
2. Fundamental liberty interest. A parent has a fundamental liberty interest in 
directing the care, custody and control of the parent's child. 
3. Government interference. The State or any political subdivision of the State 
may not infringe the liberty interest in subsection 2 unless that infringement is justified by 
a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling state interest 
through the least restrictive means necessary.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment amends Committee Amendment "A" to enact the language outlining 
the rights of parents in that portion of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22 that governs 
child and family services and child protection rather than in Title 19-A, which governs 
domestic relations.
