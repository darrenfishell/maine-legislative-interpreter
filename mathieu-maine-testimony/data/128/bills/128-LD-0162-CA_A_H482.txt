Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The bill requires the Depa1tment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to build a forensic stepdown facility in 
Augusta called the Riverview Forensic Treatment and Rehabilitation Center. DHHS has presented information to the 
legislature that the cost for a forensic stepdown facility is estimated at between 2 to 3 million dollars and that it 
already has sufficient resources to build the facility. DHHS is in the planning process to build such a facility in 
Bangor. This fiscal note assumes that the resources assigned to the Bangor facility would be used for the Riverview 
Forensic Treatment and Rehabilitation Center and that no additional appropriations are required.
