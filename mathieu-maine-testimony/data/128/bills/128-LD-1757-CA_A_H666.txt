23 COMMITTEEAMENDMENT"A "toH,P. 1210,L,D.1757 
Sec. 2. 26 MRSA §664, sub-§1-A is enacted to read: 
1-A. Minimum wage for youths. Notwithstanding subsection 1, the following 
minimum wage rate may be paid to an employee who is an unemancipated minor under 
18 years of age for the first 200 work hours of employment: 
A. The greater of: 
(1) Eighty percent of the minimum wage in effect pursuant to subsection l I 
rounded to the nearest 5 cents: and 
(2) The minimum wage required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill. It amends the minimum wage law by keeping the current minimum wage of $10 
per hour until January 1, 2020, when the minimum hourly wage rate is increased to 
$10.50. On January 1st from 2021 to 2023 the minimum hourly wage rate is increased 
50¢ per year, ending in a $12 minimum hourly wage rate in 2023. Beginning January 1, 
2024, the minimum hourly wage rate is increased by any increase in the annual cost of 
living, as is scheduled in current law for 2021. 
The amendment also establishes a special minimum wage applicable to 
unemancipated minors under 18 years of age for the first 200 work hours of employment. 
This wage must be at least the minimum wage required by the federal Fair Labor 
Standards Act or 80% of the generally applicable minimum wage under state law, 
whichever is greater.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires the $10.00 per hour minimum wage to increase to $11.00 per hour on January 1, 2019, to $12.00 
per hour on January 1, 2020 and by the CPI annually beginning on January 1, 2021. This bill freezes the minimum 
wage at $10.00 per hour until January 1, 2020, when it would increase by $.50 annually until it reaches $12.00 per 
hour on January 1, 2023. Beginning on January 1, 2024 it would increase annually by the CPI. This slowing of 
minimum wage increases may result in savings to the State and municipalities beginning in fiscal year 2018-19, 
depending on the wages that would be paid without these proposed changes. 
Additional costs to the Bureau of Labor Standards within the Department of Labor to implement the requirements of 
this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
