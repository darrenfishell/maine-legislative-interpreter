STATE OF MAINE 
SENATE 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT"(;' to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 432, 
L.D. 1280, Bill, "An Act Regarding Generic Drug Pricing" 
Amend the amendment in section 5 in ยง13800 in the 2nd paragraph in the 2nd line 
(page 1, line 27 in amendment) by striking out the following: "fair market price" and 
inserting the following: 'a price no greater than the wholesale acquisition cost' 
Amend the amendment in section 5 in ยง13800 by inserting after the 2nd paragraph a 
new paragraph to read: 
'As used in this section, "wholesale acquisition cost" means the manufacturer's list 
price for a brand-name drug or a generic drug per person per year or course of treatment 
when sold to wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United States, not including 
discounts or rebates, for the most recent month for which information is available.' 
Amend the amendment by inserting after section 5 the following: 
'Sec. 6. Intent. The costs of health care in this State are making health care 
coverage unaffordable for many consumers, increasing health care costs for the State and 
contributing to a health care crisis in this State. Increased competition in the market for 
drugs and biological products lowers prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers. 
In order for there to be competition in the prescription drug market, developers of generic 
drugs and biosimilar biological products must be able to obtain quantities of the reference 
listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological 
product is intended to compete, referred to in this section as "reference samples," for 
purposes of supporting an application for approval by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration. Closed distribution systems are impeding generic and biosimilar product 
developers from obtaining reference samples to conduct necessary testing and otherwise 
meet requirements for approval of generic and biosimilar drugs and subjecting residents 
of this State to monopoly drug prices. This Act promotes competition in the market for 
drugs and biological products by facilitating access to reference samples. Developers of 
generic drugs and biosimilar biological products are required to act in accordance with 
applicable federal law and regulations in the testing of reference samples. The increased 
sales of reference samples in this State will generate revenue for the State.'
