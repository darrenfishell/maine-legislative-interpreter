 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§10-B, as reallocated by RR 2015, c. 1, §39, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
10-B.  Viewshed of a scenic resource of state or national significance.   "Viewshed 4 
of a scenic reso urce of state or national significance" means the geographic area as 5 
viewed from a scenic resource of state or national significance that includes the proposed 6 
wind energy development.  The viewshed of a scenic resource of state or national 7 
significance ma y include the proposed wind energy development visible from a single 8 
viewer position or the proposed wind energy development visible from multiple viewer 9 
positions.  The viewshed of a scenic resource of state or national significance is limited to 10 
the geog raphic area within 8 miles, measured horizontally, from the proposed wind 11 
energy development's generating facilities , except that for a scenic resource of state or 12 
national significance listed in section 3452, subsection 4, paragraph B, the viewshed is 13 
limited to the geographic area within 15 miles, measured horizontally, from the proposed 14 
wind energy development's generating facilities . 15 
Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub -§3, as amended by PL 2015, c. 190, §4, is 16 
further amended to read:  17 
3.  Evaluation criteria.   In making its determination pursuant to subsection 1, and in 18 
determining whether an applicant for an expedited wind energy development must 19 
provide a visual impact assessment in accordance with subsection 4,  the primary siting 20 
authority shall consider:  21 
A.  The significance of the potentially affected scenic resource of state or national 22 
significance;  23 
B.  The existing character of the surrounding area;  24 
C.  The expectations of the typical viewer;  25 
D.  The expedited wind energy development's purpose and the c ontext of the 26 
proposed activity;  27 
E.  The extent, nature and duration of potentially affected public uses of the scenic 28 
resource of state or national significance and the potential effect of the generating 29 
facilities' presence on the public's continued use and enjoyment of the scenic resource 30 
of state or national significance; and  31 
F.   The scope and scale of the potential effect of views of the generating facilities on 32 
the scenic resource of state or national significance, including but not limited to 33 
issues  related to the number and extent of turbines visible from the scenic resource of 34 
state or national significance, the distance from the scenic resource of state or 35 
national significance and the effect of prominent features of the development on the 36 
landsca pe. 37 
In applying these criteria, the primary siting authority shall consider the primary impact 38 
and the cumulative scenic impact or effect of the development during both day and night 39 
on scenic resources of state or national significance.  In evaluating cum ulative scenic 40 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1446(01) -1 
 impact or effect associated with sequential observation, the department shall consider, in 1 
addition to the criteria in this subsection, the distance between viewpoints on the linear 2 
route and other forms of development along the linear route  that effect the expectation of 3 
the user of the scenic resource of state or national significance.  A finding by the primary 4 
siting authority that the development's generating facilities are a highly visible feature in 5 
the landscape is not a solely suffici ent basis for determination that an expedited wind 6 
energy project has an unreasonable adverse effect on the scenic character and existing 7 
uses related to scenic character of a scenic resource of state or national significance.  In 8 
making its determination under subsection 1, the primary siting authority shall consider 9 
insignificant the effects of portions of the development's generating facilities located 10 
more than 8 miles, measured horizontally, from  beyond the extent of the viewshed of  a 11 
scenic resource o f state or national significance.  12 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 13 
repealed and the following enacted in its place:  14 
4.  Visual impact assessment.   An applicant for an expedited wind energy 15 
development shall pro vide the primary siting authority with a visual impact assessment of 16 
the development that addresses the evaluation criteria in subsection 3 as follows:  17 
A.  If portions of the development's generating facilities are located within 8 miles, 18 
measured horizont ally, from a scenic resource of state or national significance, a 19 
visual impact assessment is required; and  20 
B.  Notwithstanding paragraph A, if portions of the development's generating 21 
facilities are located within 15 miles, measured horizontally, from the  following 22 
scenic resources of state or national significance, a visual impact assessment is 23 
required:  24 
(1)  Baxter State Park;  25 
(2)  Acadia National Park;  26 
(3)  The Caribou -Speckled Mountain Wilderness in the White Mountain National 27 
Forest;  28 
(4)  Mount Abraha m in Franklin County;  29 
(5)  The following scenic viewpoints along the Appalachian National Scenic 30 
Trail:  31 
(i)  All scenic viewpoints within the Bureau of Parks and Lands Mahoosuc 32 
Unit in Oxford County;  33 
(ii)  Old Blue Mountain in Franklin County;  34 
(iii)  Bemis  Mountain in Franklin County;  35 
(iv)  Saddleback Mountain, The Horn and Saddleback Junior in Franklin 36 
County;  37 
(v)  Spaulding Mountain in Franklin County;  38 
(vi)  Crocker Mountain and South Crocker Mountain in Franklin County;  39 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR1446(01) -1 
 (vii)  All scenic viewpoints with in the Bigelow Preserve Public Reserved 1 
Land in Franklin and Somerset counties;  2 
(viii)  Pleasant Pond Mountain in Somerset County;  3

(xi)  White Cap Mountain in Pis cataquis County.  6 
SUMMARY  7 
This bill repeals and replaces the current law regarding when a visual impact 8 
assessment is required for an expedited wind energy development.  The bill provides that 9 
a visual impact assessment is required if portions of a wind ene rgy development's 10 
generating facilities are located within 8 miles from a scenic resource of state or national 11 
significance, except that for certain specified scenic resources of state or national 12 
significance, a visual assessment is required if a developm ent's generating facilities are 13 
located within 15 miles from the scenic resource of state or national significance.  The 14 
bill also amends the definition of "viewshed of a scenic resource of state or national 15 
significance" for those same specified scenic re sources.  16
