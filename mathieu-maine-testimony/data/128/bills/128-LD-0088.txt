 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, implementing a system for the regulation and administration of the 3 
cultivation, distributi on and retail sale of recreational marijuana, a controlled substance, is 4 
a complex function with significant financial costs; and  5 
Whereas, ensuring that possession and use of recreational marijuana is limited to 6 
persons who are 21 years of age and older is  necessary to protect those who have not yet 7 
reached adulthood from the potential negative effects of irresponsible use of a controlled 8 
substance; and  9 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 10 
the meaning of the Co nstitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 11 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 12 
therefore,  13

SUMMARY  8 
This bill delays the effective date of most of the provisions of the Marijuana 9 
Legalization Act as enacted by citizen initiati ve to February 1, 2018.  The delayed 10 
effective date does not apply to the provision in the initiated bill that repeals the Maine 11 
Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 2382, subsection 1, which makes possession of up to 2 12 
1/2 ounces of marijuana a civil viola tion, or the following provisions, which will be 13 
effective as of January 30, 2017:  14 
1.  A person 21 years of age or older may use, possess or transport up to 2 1/2 ounces 15 
of marijuana;  16 
2.  A person 21 years of age or older may transfer, without remuneration , up to 2 1/2 17 
ounces of marijuana and up to 6 immature plants or seedlings to a person who is 21 years 18 
of age or older;  19 
3.  A person 21 years of age or older may possess, grow, cultivate or transport up to 6 20 
flowering marijuana plants, 12 immature plants a nd unlimited seedlings and possess all of 21 
the marijuana produced by the plants at the person's residence; and  22 
4.  A person 21 years of age or older may consume marijuana in a private residence.  23 
The bill clarifies that possession of a useable amount of mari juana by a juvenile is a 24 
crime, unless that juvenile is authorized to possess marijuana for medical use.  Finally, 25 
the bill prohibits the possession of any edible retail marijuana products until February 1, 26 
2018.  27
