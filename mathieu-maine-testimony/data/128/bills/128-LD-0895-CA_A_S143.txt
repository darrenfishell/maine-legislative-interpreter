Requiring all construction contracts to contain a provision that the manufactured goods be manufactured in the United 
States could increase construction costs to all state agencies, boards, commissions and institutions, including the 
higher educational institutions, if these goods are more expensive than those manufactured elsewhere and a waiver is 
not granted. No estimate of the potential increase can be made at this time. 
This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $89,764 in fiscal year 2018-19 for the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services for a Management Analyst II position to coordinate the contractual 
requirements concerning the origin of manufactured goods and materials.
