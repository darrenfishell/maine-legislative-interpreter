17 accumulated the necessary number of points to be awarded a moose hunting permit 
18 without participating in the public chance lottery for a moose permit; and 
19 Whereas, many residents 70 years of age and older are unable to hunt moose at that 
20 age; and 
21 Whereas, residents 65 years of age and older are better able to hunt moose if 
22 awarded a moose hunting permit; and 
23 Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the end of the 90-day period so that 
24 it takes effect in time for the upcoming moose hunting season; and 
25 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
26 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
27 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
28 therefore,' 
29 Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
30 'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this
