under this section, a law enforcement agency or a law enforcement association and a any 
designated public benefit corporation that is retained to participate in the fund-raising 
event must enter into a signed written agreement that specifies the obligations of each 
party. The Office of the Attorney General shall provide a standardized written agreement 
that must be used by the parties. 
4. No disclosure of donors. A designated public benefit corporation that engages in 
solicitation pursuant to this section may not disclose the names of any donors to any 
person, except to the Attorney General. 
5. Limited reimbursement. The law enforcement agency or law enforcement 
association may reimburse the designated public benefit corporation only for its 
advertising costs and may not otherwise pay the designated public benefit corporation for 
its services provided under this section. 
6. Registration and reporting. Each party to the written agreement pursuant to 
subsection 3 shall comply with all requirements for reporting to and registration with the

appropriated to public charities and prevent breaches of trust in their administration, 
pursuant to Title 5, section 194, subsection 2.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and provides that a law enforcement agency or 
association that engages in a fund-raising event under the limited exception provided in 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 25, section 3702-C, subsection 1, may, but is not 
required to, retain a designated public benefit corporation to participate with the law 
enforcement agency or association in the event. The amendment retains the provision of 
the bill that prohibits door-to-door solicitations.
