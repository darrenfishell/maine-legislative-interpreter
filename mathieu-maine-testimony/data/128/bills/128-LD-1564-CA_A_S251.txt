Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, makes the following 
changes to the bill. 
1. It adds establishments that cultivate, produce or sell marijuana or products in 
which marijuana is an ingredient and recreational marijuana social clubs to the list of 
employment and occupations not suitable for minors that the Depmtment of Labor must 
prohibit by rule. 
2. It retains the provision in current law that prohibits employment of a minor 14 
years of age or older and under 16 years of age when the distance between the workplace 
and the home of the minor, or any other factor, necessitates the minor's remaining away 
from home overnight. 
3. It replaces the term "a minor 14 years of age or older and under 16" with the phrase 
"a minor under 16" for greater consistency with the age category for which the 
occupational restrictions apply in current law. 
4. It adds "recreational areas" to the areas of a hotel or rooming house approved for 
employment of minors 14 and 15 years of age, and it adds "housekeeping" to the list of 
tasks explicitly prohibited for minors under 16 years of age. 
5. It strikes a provision in the bill that allows an exception to the work hour 
restrictions for minors 16 and 17 years of age when the minor is employed in a business 
solely owned by the minor's parents. 
6. It specifies that the exception to occupational restrictions applicable to a minor 
who has graduated from a vocational cooperative education program applies to a 
vocational, career and technical or cooperative education program approved by the 
Department of Education. 
7. It strikes a section of the bill that replaces the term "a minor under 16 years of age" 
with "a minor 14 years of age or older and under 16 years of age" for greater consistency 
with the age category for which the work hour restrictions apply in current law. 
8. It adds violations of the laws regarding employment of minors under 14 years of 
age and hazardous employment of minors under 18 years of age to the new provision in 
the bill providing the authority for the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Standards 
to revoke a work permit. 
9. It restores a provision in current law stricken in the bill that requires approval by 
the Attorney General of the form used by the Department of Labor for work permits for 
minors, but amends it to refer to the Office of the Attorney General.
