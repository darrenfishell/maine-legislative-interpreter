SUMMARY  10 
This bill requires an applicant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or 11 
TANF, benefits to complete a written screening to ol to determine the applicant's 12 
likelihood of current substance use.  Based on the results of the screening tool or 13 
interactions with a TANF applicant or recipient, the Department of Health and Human 14 
Services may require the applicant or recipient to submi t to a drug test as a condition of 15 
receiving benefits if the department has a reasonable suspicion that the applicant or 16 
recipient is using an illegal drug or controlled substance.  17 
If a recipient or applicant fails a drug test, that person may appeal the r esults and take 18 
a 2nd drug test.  If a recipient of TANF benefits or applicant for TANF benefits does not 19 
appeal or fails a 2nd drug test, that recipient is denied TANF benefits for 120 days and 20 
the applicant is prohibited from reapplying for TANF benefits  for 120 days.  This 21 
mandatory denial provision is repealed October 1, 2019.  22
