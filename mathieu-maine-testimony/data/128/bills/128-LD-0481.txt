 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, employers throughout this State are struggling to hire and retain skilled 3 
workers to meet the needs of their businesses; and  4 
Whereas, thousands of parents in this State are currently receiving benefits under 5 
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, program and are employed or 6 
seeking employment; and  7 
Whereas, employers are eager to hir e TANF recipients, but often see such 8 
employees struggle due to the rapid loss of TANF or other benefits after they return to 9 
work, the so -called welfare cliff; and  10 
Whereas, addressing this welfare cliff will assist employees to remain employed 11 
and to esta blish stable and long -term employment, allowing them to move permanently 12 
off of public assistance while meeting the needs of employers in this State; and  13 
Whereas, it is imperative that this legislation take effect immediately so that 14 
employees are incentiv ized to remain at work; and  15 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 16 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 17 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace , health and safety; now, 18 
therefore,  19 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  20 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3762, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. RRRR, 21 
§2, is further amended to read:  22 
B.  The department may use funds, insofar as res ources permit, provided under and in 23 
accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 24 
this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 25 
families under this chapter.  In addition to assist ance for families described in this 26 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  27 
(1)  To continue the pass -through of the first $50 per month of current child 28 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 29 
tests and benefit calculations;  30 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 31 
States who are receiving assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  32 
Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to  the categories of 33 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 34 
aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 35 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipien ts of 36 
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  37 
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household 38 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 39

 for service. A  noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 1 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 2 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 3 
through a state -funded progr am unless that noncitizen is:  4

security income in 42 United States Code, Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);  6 
(b)  A victim of domestic violence;  7

physical or mental incapacity;  16

Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the 20

SUMMARY  3 
This bill increases the amount of income earned by recipients of benefits under the 4 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program that is disregarded in determining the 5 
amount of benefits they receive. The amount of the disregard is lowered over time as 6 
recipients make the transition to stable employment.  7
