Standing Committee on Transportation; and be it further 
Sec. 4. Appointments; convening of commission. Resolved: That all 
appointments must be made no later than 30 days following the effective date of this 
resolve. The appointing authorities shall notify the Executive Director of the Legislative 
Council once all appointments have been completed. After appointment of all members, 
the chairs shall call and convene the first meeting of the commission. If30 days or more 
after the effective date of this resolve a majority of but not all appointments have been 
made, the chairs may request authority and the Legislative Council may grant authority 
for the commission to meet and conduct its business; and be it further 
Sec. 5. Duties. Resolved: That the commission shall study how to reform and 
adequately supplement funding for the State's transportation infrastructure to promote 
equity, sustainability and predictability in a manner that allows the State to responsibly 
provide a safe and reliable state transportation system. The study must focus on funding 
the state highway and bridge system, but must also consider capital funding of 
multimodal infrastructure. The commission shall: 
1. Determine funding levels necessary to achieve the highway and bridge capital 
goals set forth in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 73, subsection 7, 
paragraphs A to D, including anticipated shortfalls for the next 10 years; 
2. Identify mechanisms that will increase the predictability of general obligation 
bonding levels for capital planning at the Department of Transportation for the state 
highway and bridge system and multimodal infrastructure for the next 10 years; 
3. Identify mechanisms to address the erosion of Highway Fund receipts and the 
rising inequity caused by higher automobile fuel efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles, 
such as adding a registration fee surcharge on hybrid, electric or other alternative fuel 
passenger automobiles; 
4. Consider a voluntary pilot program to assess the potential for mileage-based 
revenue collection as an alternative to the gas tax system; 
5. Identify methods to more equitably share the costs of the highway system between 
residents of this State and nonresidents, including exploring the feasibility of reducing 
year-round baseline gasoline tax rates and adding a seasonal gasoline tax surcharge; 
6. Consider new highway tolling options; 
7. Consider adding a wholesale fuel tax component, including options that would 
reduce baseline per gallon fuel tax rates; 
8. Consider adjusting fuel tax rates, including options that can be implemented or 
eliminated as fuel prices rise due to market forces or increases in the federal fuel tax 
rates; 
9. Consider dedicating a portion of sale tax receipts from transportation-related sales 
to transportation; 
10. Evaluate the likelihood of possible future funds being dedicated to transportation 
from revenues from potential additional casinos in the State; and
