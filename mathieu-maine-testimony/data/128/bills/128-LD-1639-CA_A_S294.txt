34 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 591, L.D. 1639 
1. It removes provisions authorizing a taxpayer receiving the headquarters credit to 
have any unused credit carry-forward for the research expense tax credit, super credit for 
substantial expansions of research and development, jobs and investment tax credit and 
Maine capital investment credit be made refundable for any tax year to the extent of the 
headquarters credit. 
2. It removes from consideration as qualified investments expenditures for employee 
training and education and payment of student loan debt. 
3. It provides that no credit may be claimed in any year in which employment targets 
are not met. During the first 10 tax years for which the credit is claimed, the employment 
target is a rolling average of 80 new full-time Maine jobs added per year. In the first year 
of the credit, the 80 new jobs may include employees added since the first day of the tax 
year to account for the fact that the certificate of completion may be granted late in the 
tax year. In years 11 through 20 of the credit, the employment target requires that the 800 
jobs created in years 1 through 10 be sustained. The amendment also provides that new 
jobs may not be counted to establish eligibility under more than one certificate of 
completion. 
4. It provides that if the certificate of completion is transferred the transferee must 
meet the same eligibility requirements and conditions as applied to the original certified 
applicant. 
5. It provides that reports by the taxpayer and the State Tax Assessor are public 
records and provides that the State Tax Assessor must disclose information regarding 
credits received to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
over taxation matters. 
6. It requires the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability to 
complete a design evaluation review of the credit, identifying the extent to which the 
design of the credit supports the accomplishment of the credit's purposes, intent and 
goals, the extent to which benefits are directed to the intended beneficiaries and the extent 
to which the administration of the credit is efficient and effective. The office is directed to 
include with its evaluation recommended performance measures for the credit and an 
identification of the data needed for effective evaluation. 
7. It provides that the purpose of the credit is to create high-quality jobs in the State 
by encouraging the location or expansion of the headquarters of major businesses in the 
State. 
8. It makes technical corrections.
