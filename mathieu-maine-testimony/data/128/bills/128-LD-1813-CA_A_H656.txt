Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 17-A MRSA ยง261, sub-ยง5 is enacted to read: 
S. For purposes of this section. "indirect contact" includes, but is not limited to, a 
person photographing another person who has not in fact attained 14 years of age after 
the person's having been notified. in writing or othetwise. by a law enforcement officer. 
corrections officer or judicial officer not to engage in that conduct. The notification not

purposes of this subsection. "photographing" means making. capturing. generating or 
saving a print, negative. slide. motion picture, computer data file. videotape or other

SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and changes the title. It adds a definition of "indirect 
contact" to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 261 and applies that definition 
to prohibit a person from photographing another person under 14 years of age if the 
person has been convicted of a sexual assault against or sexual exploitation of another 
person under 14 years of age and the person has been notified, in writing or othetwise, 
not to engage in this conduct by a law enforcement officer, corrections officer or judicial 
officer. The notification expires after one year. The definition of "photographing" is 
based on a definition of "photograph" in Title 17-A, section 281, subsection 3.
