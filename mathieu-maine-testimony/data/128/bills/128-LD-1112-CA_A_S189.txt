SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It changes the maternal and infant death review 
panel to the maternal, fetal and infant mortality review panel. It provides that "director" 
in the laws governing the review panel refers to the medical director of the Maine Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention because of the recent reorganization of personnel 
within the center. It allows the panel coordinator of the review panel to obtain, without 
the individual's or family's consent, the health information of a woman who died during 
pregnancy or within 42 days of giving birth, a child who died within one year of birth or a 
mother of a child who died within one year of birth, including fetal deaths after 28 weeks 
of gestation. It provides that the review panel is required to meet at least twice per year.
