22 SUMMARY 
23 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment provides that a carrier shall 
24 require an enrollee that receives a surprise bill from an out-of-network provider to pay 
25 only the applicable cost-sharing coinsurance, copayment, deductible or other out-of-
26 pocket expense that would be imposed for the health care services if the services were 
27 rendered by a network provider. The amendment also sets the reimbursement rate for that 
28 out-of-network provider at the network rate under the enrollee's health plan unless the 
29 carrier and out-of-network provider agree otherwise. If an out-of-network provider is 
30 reimbursed by the carrier, the provider may not bill the enrollee for any amount beyond 
31 the enrollee's applicable cost sharing. Under the amendment, "surprise bill" means a bill 
32 for health care services, other than emergency services, received by an emollee for 
33 services rendered by an out-of-network provider, when the services were rendered by the 
34 out-of-network provider at a network provider, during a service or procedure perfonned 
35 by a network provider or during a service or procedure previously approved or authorized 
36 by the carrier and the enrollee did not knowingly elect to obtain such services from the 
37 out-of-network provider.
