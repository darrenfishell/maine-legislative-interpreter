5 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 382, L.D. 538 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee and strikes and replaces the 
bill. The amendment retains the language of the bill, which allows an advanced practice 
register nurse to use the prefix "Doctor" or "Dr.," but moves the language to the existing 
statute that authorizes other licensed professionals to use the prefixes "Doctor" and "Dr."
