extracted from springs or other underground sources in this State by a bottled water 3 
operator that extracted more than 1,000,000 gallons in the previous calendar year if the 4 
water is packaged for sale.  The revenues from the tax are transferred to a newly created 5

testing and 15% will support lake water quality monitoring and support.  8
