17 SUMMARY 
18 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. The amendment amends the powers 
19 and duties of the Board of Trustees of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to include 
20 that the board establish cettification standards and a training program for forest rangers 
21 and the state supervisor of the forest protection unit of the Bureau of Forestry within the 
22 Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The training program must 
23 include preservice law enforcement training under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 25, 
24 section 2804-B; an additional basic forest ranger training program developed by the state

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would modify certification standards of, and create a training program for, forest rangers within the 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestly (ACF) to allow them to carry firearms in the line of duty. It 
directs the Maine Criminal Justice Academy (MCJA) to develop a forest ranger specific law enforcement training 
program in conjunction with the ACF. 
This bill includes appropriations of $87,899 to purchase firearms, ammunition, holsters and lockboxes to arm forest 
rangers, $13,330 for firearms training and $35,302 for overtime staffing in fiscal year 2017-18. Also, starting in 
fiscal year 2018-19 all forest rangers will complete annual firearms certification requiring an appropriation of $5 ,951. 
The department has inidicated that 50 Rangers currently classified as Forest Ranger II positions will need to be 
reclassified with a salary equivalent to a Game Warden or Marine Patrol Officer. If such a reclassification occurs the 
cost is estimated to be $9,880 per positibn for a total of $494,000. This cost is not included in this fiscal note. 
Current statute provides that Forest Rangers have law enforcement authority but they are exempt from having to 
complete the Basic Law Enforcement Training Program (BLETP) required of other law enforcement officers because 
they do not carty a firearm. With the issuance of firearms the ACF has indicated that it will require forest rangers 
who have not already completed the BLETP to complete a newly developed forest ranger specific basic law 
enforcement training program within 5 years. Because this program has yet to be developed, no appropriation for this 
cost is made at this time. Curt·ently there are 59 positions that would need to complete the newly created training 
program. The department projects that they will begin to cycle through training at a rate of 5 positions per year 
starting in fiscal year 2018-19. Using the current BLETP as an estimate, this training would have an annual cost of 
$36,403 in tuition and $72,366 for overtime to fill coverage requirements.
