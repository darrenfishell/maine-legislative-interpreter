13 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
14 section number to read consecutively. 
15 SUMMARY 
16 This amendment retains the provisions of the bill that clarify the standard of review 
17 in succession planning for motor vehicle dealers and that prevent a manufacturer from 
18 denying claims due to clerical errors or technicalities. 
19 The amendment also makes it an unfair and deceptive trade practice for a motor 
20 vehicle manufacturer to use unreasonable performance standards in assessing motor 
21 vehicle dealer compliance with franchise agreements; to fail to compensate a motor 
22 vehicle dealer for all of the reconditioning expenses and for all labor and costs associated 
23 with performing a recall repair on a new or used vehicle; to fail to provide compensation 
24 to dealers when a used motor vehicle in the dealer's inventory is subject to a do not drive 
25 order or a stop sale order based on a safety defect or violation of an emissions standard 
26 and no remedy exists or the parts are unavailable to remedy the defect or violation within 
27 30 days; to compete with a motor vehicle dealer by opening a dealership of any line make 
28 in the State without first obtaining a determination from the Maine Motor Vehicle 
29 Franchise Board that there is no dealer within the relevant market area available to own 
30 and operate a dealership of that line make; and to deny a claim for a warranty repair or a 
31 recall repair on a vehicle when the need for the repair was discovered by the dealer during 
32 the course of a separate repair requested by the customer. 
33 The amendment also enacts a provision that mirrors federal law by requiring a 
34 manufacturer to compensate a dealer when a new motor vehicle in the dealer's inventory 
35 is subject to a do not drive order or a stop sale order based on a safety defect and there is 
36 a delay before the necessary remedy and parts are made available to the dealer to repair 
3 7 the vehicle.
