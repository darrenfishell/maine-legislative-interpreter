Fiscal Note 
Contingent foture biennium savings -General Fund 
This bill will become effective only if approved by the voters of Caiy Plantation at the next general election to be held 
in November. If approved, the deorganization of Cary Plantation would take effect on July 1, 2019. 
For purposes of this analysis, all other factors in the calculation of the total cost of K-12 public education and the 
state's contribution are assumed to be held constant. Given this assumption, the deorganization of Cary Plantation will 
lower the total cost of K-12 public education beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 and result in savings to the General 
Purpose Aid for Local Schools program within the Department of Education. The amount of savings can not be 
detem1ined at this time. For comparison purposes, the total cost allocation for Caty Plantation for the 2017-2018 
school year is $206,644 with the state contributing $111,832 of that total. 
The Division of State Schools -Education in the Unorganized Territories program in the Department of Education 
will incur future General Fund expenditures to provide services to the Unorganized Territories. These expenditures 
would be ongoing and would be to provide schooling to students from Caty Plantation. The cost can not be 
determined at this time, but is estimated to be approximately $316,065 annually. The General Fund would be fully 
reimbursed for these costs by higher collections made through the Municipal Cost Component program. 
Any additional costs incurred by Maine Revenue Services related to the deorganization of Caty Plantation can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The minor additional costs associated with the filing of certain election 
results can be absorbed by the Secretary of State utilizing existing budgeted resources.
