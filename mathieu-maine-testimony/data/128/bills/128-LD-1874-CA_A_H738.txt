Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The resolve requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to continue or renew contracts in effect 
on the effective date of the resolve with certain Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Councils through January 31, 
2019. As the contracts are currently in effect, there is no fiscal impact to continuing the contracts. 
Additionally, the resolve requires the DHHS to develop a plan for the future contracting of certain services to protect 
children and to report to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services by January 1st, 2019 on the 
final proposed plan. Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to convene the stakeholder 
group and report back to the committee are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
