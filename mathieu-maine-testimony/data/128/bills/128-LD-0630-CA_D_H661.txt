those permits pursuant to subsection 1. A person who violates this subsection commits a 
Class E crime.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority repott of the committee, replaces the bill. The 
bill repeals the prohibition on exchanging a moose permit for consideration and directs 
the Depmtment of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish an online transfer system for 
pennits. The amendment removes the provision of the bill that directs the department to 
establish an online transfer system for permits, but, like the bill, the amendment repeals 
the prohibition on exchanging moose permits for consideration. This amendment 
prohibits persons other than the holders of moose permits who are exchanging hunting 
zones, areas or seasons to facilitate the exchange. The amendment establishes that a 
person who facilitates an exchange of moose permits commits a Class E crime. The 
amendment clarifies that the State bears no responsibility for enforcing the terms of an 
exchange between the permit holders.
