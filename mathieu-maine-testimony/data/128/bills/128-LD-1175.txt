prohibited from doing so by a temporary emergency gun violence restraining order issued 21 
pursuant to subchapter 2, an ex parte gun violence restraining order issued pursuant to 22 
subchapter 3 or a gun v iolence restraining order issued after notice and a hearing pursuant 23 
to subchapter 4 commits a Class D crime.  As part of the sentencing alternative, the court 24 
shall prohibit the person from having in the person's custody or control, owning, 25 
purchasing, po ssessing or receiving or attempting to purchase or receive a firearm or 26 
ammunition for a 5 -year period, to commence upon the expiration of the gun violence 27 
restraining order.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill creates a gun violence restraining order to authorize a court t o order a person 30 
to surrender that person's firearms and ammunition for a specific period of time when it 31 
has been proved that the person poses a danger of causing personal injury to that person 32 
or another person.  The bill provides that:  33 
1.  A law enforce ment officer may file for a temporary emergency gun violence 34 
restraining order, which expires in 21 days;  35 
 
 Page 10 - 128LR2097(01) -1 
 2.  A law enforcement officer or a family or household member of the person may 1 
request an ex parte gun violence restraining order, which expires in 2 1 days.  The court is 2 
required to hold a hearing to determine if a one -year order should be issued within 21 3 
days;  4 
3.  A law enforcement officer or a family or household member of the person may 5 
request that a one -year gun violence restraining order be iss ued.  The plaintiff must prove 6 
by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses a significant danger and that the 7 
order is necessary to prevent injury because less restrictive alternatives have been tried or 8 
are inappropriate in the specific case;  9 
4.  The subject of a gun violence restraining order is required to surrender all firearms 10 
and ammunition in the person's possession to a law enforcement officer or to sell the 11 
firearms and ammunition to a federally licensed firearms dealer.  If the firearms and 12 
ammunition are surrendered to a law enforcement agency, the firearms and ammunition 13 
must be returned to the person at the expiration of the gun violence restraining order; and  14 
5.  A person who possesses firearms or ammunition in violation of a gun viol ence 15 
restraining order commits a Class D crime.  Part of the sentence must include the 16 
prohibition on possession of firearms and ammunition for an additional 5 years.  17
