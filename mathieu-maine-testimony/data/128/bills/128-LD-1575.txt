 um cash wage paid directly to a 
tipped service employee and the minimum hourly  wage established under subsection 1.  
Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January  1st thereafter, the minimum cash wage

charge, those tips 
may be considered in determining whether the employee is a tipped 27 
e
mployee and the application of the tip credit.  28

39 40 2.  It requires posters regarding video di splay
  terminal safety and minimum wage and 
overtime requirements to be posted in the sa me location as other posters required by the 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Sta ndards and establishes a penalty structure for 
violations of the posting requirements with in the section of law requiring posting. 
3.  It removes the requirement that a willful  violation of the requirement to cooperate 
and comply with an investigation by the bureau is punishable as a criminal conviction because the statute does not provide a means to obtain a conviction and instead provides 
for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for a willful violation. 
4.  It brings the law prohibiting discrimination against tobacco use by employees into 
compliance with federal law by allowing an employer to discriminate against an 
employee who uses tobacco when determining health and life insurance premiums and 
other employee benefit plans but exempts from discrimination an employee's tobacco use 
that is part of a voluntary wellness program for the cessation of tobacco use. 
5.  It amends the law regarding the possession of firearms by employees to reflect the 
repeal of the requirement to obtain a concealed carry permit and clarifies that it does not 
authorize an employee to carry or possess a firearm where carrying or possessing a firearm is prohibited, including on worksites that are not owned by that employee's 
employer. 
6.  It amends the law regarding rest breaks to clarify the differences between paid rest 
breaks and unpaid lunch breaks.  
7.  It amends the exemption from rest breaks for those employees who have frequent 
rest breaks during the work day to specify that the exemption only applies if the rest 
breaks are paid rest breaks and of shorter duration than the 30 minutes otherwise 
required. 
8.  It amends the law regarding the exemption from mandatory overtime pay for 
salaried workers to specify that the exemp tion applies to a salaried employee who works 
in a bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity who meets the test for a 
white collar exemption, including a minimum salary level, as established in the final rules 
adopted by the United States Department of Labor pursuant to the federal Fair Labor 
Standards Act and allows such employees to be  paid on a monthly basis, instead of every 
16 days, as for other employees. 
9.  It amends the law regarding timing of  payment of wages to specify that the 
payment must include all wages earned for th e prior pay period, instead of those earned 
within 8 days of the payment date, and allows  such payments to be made on the next 
business day when the payment date occurs on a day when the business is closed. The bill 
prohibits an employer from increasing any pay interval without providing notice to its 
employees. 
10.  Current law requires an employer to keep a record showing the date and amount 
paid to each employee and a daily record of time worked by an employee.  This bill 
specifies that those records must be main tained by the employer for 3 years.

39 11.  Current law requires an employee leaving employment to be paid within a 
reasonable time after de
mand at the office of the employer where payrolls are kept and 
wages are paid. Whenever the terms of employment include provisions for paid 
vacations, vacation pay on cessation of employme nt has the same status as wages earned. 
This bill removes the "reasonable time" requirement and instead specifies that when an 
employee leaves employment, that employee must be paid on the next established 
payday. The bill also specifies that payment of vacation is payable only in accordance with the employer's established policy or practice.  
12.  It repeals the exemption from the minimum wage and overtime laws for an 
individual employed as a switchboard operato r in a public telephone exchange that has 
less than 750 stations. 
13.  It amends the definitions  of "automobile mechanic," "automobile parts clerk" and 
"automobile service writer" to reflect provisions in federal law. 
14.  It changes the definition of "tip" and provisions regarding service charges to 
conform to the federal Fair Labor Standard s Act, or FLSA.  Current Maine law creates a 
wage violation under the FLSA by allowing a charge added to a customer's bill to be 
treated as a tip, whereas the FLSA treats it as a service charge, which is the employer's 
property not the service worker's. 
15.  It clarifies the intent of the Legislature, to conform with federal law, that the 
distribution of certain products is exempt from the provisions governing overtime pay.  It 
amends the 1995 law by reordering the series of exempt tasks for the purpose of 
eliminating any perceived ambiguity. 
16.  It adds the exemption adopted by the United States Department of Labor in 2015 
for a domestic service worker employed to provide companionship services. The 
provision of care provided in conjunction with the provision of fellowship and protection 
cannot exceed 20% of the total hours worked per person and per workweek to qualify for 
exemption. 
17.   It repeals the definition of "hotel " for purposes of the subchapter on minimum 
wage since the term is not used in that subchapter. 
18.  It repeals and reallocates the provisions  of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, 
chapter 7, subchapter 4, artic le 1 regarding the application of the subchapter, record of 
work hours of minors and penalties. 
19.  It requires the bureau to conduct a survey every 3 years to determine the 
prevailing hourly wage and benefits rate in the construction industry.  Current law 
requires the bureau to determine that  wage and benef its rate annually. 
20.  It repeals the provisions of law regarding placement restrictions for a person 
required to work as a condition of receiving public assistance. 
21.  It updates the safety standard for inspection of firefighters' breathing apparatus to 
require that the inspection procedure follow th e procedure specified in the manufacturer's
