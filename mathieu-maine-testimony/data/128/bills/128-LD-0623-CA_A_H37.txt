FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 439, L.D. 623, Bill, "An Act To 
Require Biennial State Motor Vehicle Inspections" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Require Biennial State Motor Vehicle Inspections for New Motor 
Vehicles' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 29-A MRSA ยง1751, sub-ยง1-A is enacted to read: 
1-A. Exception; new motor vehicles. Notwithstanding subsection 1, a new motor 
vehicle that has had an inspection under this section is not required to have another 
inspection until 2 years from the last day of the month in which it was initially registered 
and then 4 years from the last day of the month in which it was initially registered. For 
purposes of this subsection, "new motor vehicle" means a motor vehicle that has not been 
previously titled and registered and does not include a commercial motor vehicle, trailer 
or semitrailer.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
changes the title. It provides that a new motor vehicle that has had an inspection is not 
required to have another inspection until 2 years from the last day of the month in which 
it was initially registered and then 4 years from the last day of the month in which it was 
initially registered. After this time period has passed, the motor vehicle is required to 
have an annual motor vehicle safety inspection.
