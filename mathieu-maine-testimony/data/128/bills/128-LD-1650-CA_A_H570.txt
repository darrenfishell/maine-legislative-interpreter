This bill increases the sales tax rate on maiijuana from 10% to 20% and distributes 12% of the sales tax revenue 
received to the Adult Use Marijuana Public Health and Safety Fund (see next paragraph) and 6% to municipalities. 
Maine Revenue Services has assumed a delay in the effective date of the sales tax to Janua1y 1, 2019. General Fund 
revenue is reduced by $2,254,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $7 ,418,640 in fiscal year 2018-19 and Local 
Government.Fund revenue is reduced by $46,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $138,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. The 
bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $228,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to DAFS in order to remit 
a portion of the sales tax to municipalities. 
The bill establishes the Adult Use Marijuana Public Health and Safety Fund to facilitate public health and safety 
awareness and education programs, initiatives, campaigns and activities and enhanced law enforcement training 
programs for local, county and state law enforcement officers. The 12% of sales tax revenue dedicated to this fund 
should generate $428,640 in fiscal year 2018-19 and $3,147,120 by fiscal year 2020-21. 
The bill also creates the Adult Use Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund and transfers the balance of the Retail 
Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund, currently $1,224,246, into it. 
The bill creates manufactming, retail store, social club, testing and tiered cultivation licenses and sets the fee structure 
that DAFS may charge for each license. In fiscal year 2017-18 license revenue is estimated to generate $200,000 in 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue; in fiscal year 2018-19 this revenue is estimated to increase to $1,209,075. 
The bill includes General Fund appropriations to DAFS of $172,815 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $1,984,225 in fiscal 
year 2018-19 for 26 permanent positions. The bill also includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to DAFS of 
$175,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $600,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 for All Other costs associated with these 
positions. The bill also includes a one-time appropriation of $550,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 to DAFS for Tracking 
System and Licensing System software. The bill includes General Fund approp1iations to ACF of $94,568 in fiscal 
year 2017-18 and $595,481 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 7 pemmnent positions. The bill also includes Other Special 
Revenue Funds allocations to ACF of $25,000 and $507 ,319 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 5 permanent positions and 
related All Other costs. 
If maiijuana use increases because of legalization, the number of child welfare cases reported to the Department of 
Health and Human Services could 1ise. Any increase in the number of investigations is not expected to increase costs 
to the department significantly. 
This bill may lead to a reduction in the number of Maine Medical Marijuana Program licenses, as some licensees may 
decide to participate only in the non-medical marijuana industry. If this occurs it would reduce revenue from license 
fees that is now credited to the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Fund to support that program. Any such reduction is 
expected to be minor. 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $43,701 and a Highway Fund allocation of $23,962 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Department of Public Safety for one Identification Specialist II position and related costs to process 
c1iminal history background checks for marijuana establishment operators. Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to 
the Department of Public Safety will be increased by the amount charged for each background check. The amount of 
the increased revenue has not been determined at this time. 
This bill includes General Fund deappropriations of $50,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $75,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 
from the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to reflect savings from a reduction in the cost of assigned 
counsel related to marijuana violations. 
General Fund fine revenue is expected to be reduced from fewer marijuana violations. Costs to the Department of the 
Attorney General may be reduced as well. No estimate of these changes is made at this time.

the Maine Criminal Justice Academy for enhanced law enforcement training for marijuana,enforcement.
