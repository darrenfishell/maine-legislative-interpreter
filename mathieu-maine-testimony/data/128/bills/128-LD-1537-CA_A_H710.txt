'Sec. 6. Application. Those sections of this Act that amend the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 36, section 5122, subsection 2, paragraph FF and that enact Title 36, 
section 5122, subsection 2, paragraph PP apply to tax years beginning on or after January

SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the implementation of the new credit for student loan 
repayment to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The amendment changes 
the calculation of the credit for qualified individuals to the lesser of the amount paid on 
eligible education loans during the taxable year and 15% of the outstanding eligible 
education loan debt on the date the first education loan payment is made after a degree is 
earned. It changes the calculation of the credit for employers to the lesser of the amount 
paid by an employer on behalf of a qualified employee during the taxable year during the 
term of employment and 20% of the outstanding eligible education loan debt on the date 
the first education loan payment is made after December 31, 2018. The amendment 
provides that the credit is available to the spouse of an individual eligible for a credit even 
if the spouse is not employed. The amendment provides income tax deductions for 
student loan payments made directly to a lender by an employer on behalf of a qualified 
employee and payments made directly to a lender on behalf of a taxpayer by a student 
loan repayment program funded by a nonprofit foundation and administered by the 
Finance Authority of Maine for residents of the State employed by a business located in 
the State.
