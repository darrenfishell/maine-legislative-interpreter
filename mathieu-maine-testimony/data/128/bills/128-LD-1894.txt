or satisfactory to the State Tax Assessor, must be furnished by each user claiming the 8 
credit.  When the amount of the credit to which any user is entitled for any quarter 9 
exceeds the amount of the tax for which that user is liable for the same quarter, the excess 10 
may be allowed as a credit on the tax for which that user would be otherwise liable for 11 
another quarter or quarters.  Upon application to the assessor, the excess may be refunded 12 
if the applicant has paid to another state or province under a lawful requirement of that 13 
jurisdiction a tax similar in  effect to the tax imposed by section 3203 on the use or 14 
consumption of that fuel outside the State, at the same rate per gallon that tax was paid in 15 
this State, but in no case to exceed the then current rate per gallon of the tax imposed by 16

assessor, if satisfied after investigation that a refund is justified, shall so certify to the 18
