352, Pt. A, §2, is further amended to read:  32 
B.  Subject to paragraph A, an employer's contribution rate for the 12 -month period 33 
commencing January 1st of each year is based upon the employer's experience ratin g 34 
record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.  The employer's reserve 35 
ratio is the percent obtained by dividing the amount, if any, by which the employer's 36 
contributions, credited from the time the employer first or most recently became an 37 
employer, whichever date is later, up to and including June 30th of the preceding 38 
year, including any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or 39 
before July 31st of that year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same 40 
perio d, by the employer's average annual payroll for the period of 36 consecutive 41 
months ending June 30th of the preceding year.  The employer's contribution rate is 42

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT  (1)  The commissioner shall prepare a schedule listi ng all employers for whom a 1 
reserve ratio has been computed pursuant to this paragraph, in the order of their 2 
reserve ratios, beginning with the highest ratio.  For each employer, the schedule 3 
must show:  4 
(a)  The amount of the employer's reserve ratio;  5 
(b)  The amount of the employer's annual taxable payroll; and  6 
(c)  A cumulative total consisting of the amount of the employer's annual 7 
taxable payroll plus the amount of the annual taxable payrolls of all other 8 
employers preceding the employer on the list.  9 
(2)  The commissioner shall segregate employers into contribution categories in 10 
accordance with the cumulative totals under subparagraph (1), division (c).  The 11 
contribution category is determined by the cumulative payroll percentage limits 12 
in column B.  Ea ch contribution category is identified by the contribution 13 
category number in column A that is opposite the figures in column B, which 14 
represent the percentage limits of each contribution category.  If an employer's 15 
taxable payroll falls in more than one c ontribution category, the employer must 16 
be assigned to the lower -numbered contribution category, except that an 17 
employer may not be assigned to a higher contribution category than is assigned 18 
any other employer with the same reserve ratio.  19

(3-A)  Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner shall compute a reserve 3 
multiple to determine the schedule and planned yield in effect for a rate ye ar. The 4 
reserve multiple is determined by dividing the fund reserve ratio by the average 5 
benefit cost rate. The determination date is October 31st of each calendar year.  6 
The schedule and planned yield that apply for the 12 -month period commencing 7 
on Janua ry 1, 2008 and every January 1st thereafter are shown on the line of the 8 
following table that corresponds with the applicable reserve multiple in column 9

(4)  The commissioner shall compute the predetermined yield by multiplying the 22 
ratio of total wages to taxable wages for the preceding calendar year by the 23 
planned yield.  24 
(5)  The commissioner shall determine the contribution rates effective for a rate 25 
year by multiplying the predetermined yield by the experience factors for each 26 
contribution category.  Contribution category 20 in the table in subparagraph (2) 27 
must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%.  The employer's experience 28 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) that 29 
corresponds with the employer's contribution category in col umn A, except that 30 
the experience factors in column E must be used to determine the contribution 31 
rates for rate years 2000 and 2001 and those in column D must be used for rate 32 
years 2002 and 2003.  Beginning January 1, 2018, for rate years when schedule A 33 
is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3 -A), the experience factor in 34 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of 35 
0.00 in column C.  36 
(6)  If, subsequent to the assignment of contribution rates for a rate year, the 37 
reserve ratio of an employer is recomputed and changed, the employer must be 38 
placed in the position on the schedule prepared pursuant to subparagraph (1) that 39 
the employer would have occupied had the corrected reserve ratio been shown on 40 
the schedule.  The altered position on the schedule does not affect the position of 41 
any other employer.  42 19 90.01  95.00  2.20 2.05000  1.9000

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT  (7)  In computing the contribution rates, only the wages reported by employers 1 
liable for payment of contributions into the fund and net benefits paid that are 2 
charged to an employer's experience rating record or to the fund are considered in 3 
the computation of the average benefit cost rate and the ratio of total wages to 4 
taxable wages.  5 
(8)  Beginning January 1, 2008, all contribution rates must be reduced by the 6 
Competitiv e Skills Scholarship Fund predetermined yield as defined in section 7

paragraph may not be reduced below 5.4%.  9
