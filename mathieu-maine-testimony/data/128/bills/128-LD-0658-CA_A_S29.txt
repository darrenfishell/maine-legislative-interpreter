policy renewal date, except for a policyholder who has elected to receive the notice 
only if a change has been made in the regulated insurance entity's information

(1) Personal information is collected only from the policyholder or from public 
records; or 
(2) A notice meeting the requirements of this section has been given within the 
previous 24 months. 
C. In the case of a policy reinstatement or change in insurance benefits, except for a 
policyholder who has elected to receive the notice only if a change has been made in 
the regulated insurance entity's information practices, the notice must be provided no

change has been made in the entity's information practices. The bill requires that notices
