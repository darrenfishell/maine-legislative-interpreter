44 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 484, L.D. 1406 
This amendment directs the organization to develop a plan to collect data from 
manufacturers that will help explain how prescription drug prices are established. The 
organization is required to work with other state and national agencies and organizations 
to determine how to conduct the data collection. The organization is required to submit 
the plan as well as any recommendations for legislation to the joint standing committee of 
the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters by April 1, 2019. That 
committee may report out legislation to the First or Second Regular Session of the 129th 
Legislature. 
Using the plan developed and reported to the Legislature, starting in 2019, the 
organization must require the manufacturer of each drug on the list to disclose drug 
production, research and development costs, marketing and advertising costs and actual 
costs paid by purchasers. The manufacturer must certify the accuracy of the information 
and provide it within 60 days after the information is requested by the organization. The 
organization is authorized to request additional information related to the required 
information. 
The information that the manufacturers are directed to provide to the organization, 
unless the information is already publicly accessible or available or previously released in 
the public domain, must be held confidential at the request of the manufacturer. The 
organization may release information that was previously accessible or available or 
released in the public domain. The organization may release additional information as 
long as the information released is not a trade secret. The organization must treat the 
information as "Level II" information as required by rules that have already been adopted 
by the organization. 
This amendment provides that the manufacturer may voluntarily provide any other 
information the manufacturer determines relevant to the increase in wholesale acquisition 
cost, including but not limited to information about all manufacturer-sponsored assistance 
programs for that drug in the previous year, including the terms of the programs, the total 
amount of fmancial assistance provided to residents of the State and the average amount 
of assistance per resident of the State for whom assistance was provided. This 
information is not considered confidential and the organization may release it, identifying 
both the manufacturer and the individual drug. 
The organization is required to submit an annual report to the Legislature based on 
the list of up to 75 drugs and the wholesale acquisition cost information. The 
organization may include in the report recommendations for increasing prescription drug 
pricing transparency. Once the organization starts collecting information from 
manufacturers in 2019, the report must also include at least a summary of the 
manufacturer information. The organization is required to post the report online. 
This amendment replaces the penalties in the bill to provide that when a manufacturer 
violates the reporting requirements, the Board of Directors of the Maine Health Data 
Organization may impose a fme of not more than $10,000 per day after the deadline for 
reporting required information. If the manufacturer fails to pay a fine, or if an injunction 
is necessary, the board may refer the matter to the Attorney General. The Attorney 
General may bring an action in Superior Court for injunctive relief, enforcement of fines, 
costs, attorney's fees and any other appropriate remedy.
