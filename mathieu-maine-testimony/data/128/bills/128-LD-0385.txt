SUMMARY  13 
This bill provides for the establishment of a new stewardship program in the State for 14 
discarded nickel -cadmium and small sealed lead -acid re chargeable batteries.  Under the 15 
bill, a producer of such rechargeable batteries, or an organization comprising one or more 16 
producers of such rechargeable batteries, submits a plan for the establishment of a battery 17 
stewardship program to the Commissioner of Environmental Protection for approval.  18 
Once approved, a program operates to provide convenient, free statewide collection 19 
opportunities for discarded rechargeable batteries covered under the program, and 20 
discarded rechargeable batteries collected throu gh the program are recycled or otherwise 21 
responsibly managed.  This bill also amends existing laws relating to certain rechargeable 22 
battery types to avoid statutory conflicts with the new stewardship program for 23 
rechargeable batteries.  24
