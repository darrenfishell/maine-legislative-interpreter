UNIFORM REAL PROPERTY TRANSFER ON DEATH ACT (2009)  21 
Prefatory Note  22 
One of the main innovations in the property law of the twentieth century h as been the 23 
development of asset -specific will substitutes for the transfer of property at death. By 24 
these mechanisms, an owner may designate beneficiaries to receive the property at the 25 
owner's death without waiting for probate and without the beneficiary  designation 26 
needing to comply with the witnessing requirements of wills. Examples of specific assets 27 
that today routinely pass outside of probate include the proceeds of life insurance policies 28 
and pension plans, securities registered in transfer on death  (TOD) form, and funds held 29 
in pay on death (POD) bank accounts.  30 
Today, nonprobate transfers are widely accepted. The trend has largely focused on 31 
assets that are personal property, such as the assets described in the preceding paragraph. 32 
However, long -standing uniform law speaks more broadly. Section 6 -101 of the Uniform 33 
Probate Code (UPC) provides:  " A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in  an 34 
insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated 35 
or uncertificate d security, account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, 36 
compensation plan, pension plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, 37 
conveyance, deed of gift , marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a 38 
similar  nature is nontestamentary " (emphasis supplied).  39 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 A small but growing number of jurisdictions have implemented the principle of UPC 1 
Section 6 -101 by enacting statutes providing an asset -specific mechanism for the 2 
nonprobate transfer of land. This is done by  permitting owners of interests in real 3 
property to execute and record a transfer on death (TOD) deed. By this deed, the owner 4 
identifies the beneficiary or beneficiaries who will succeed to the property at the owner's 5 
death. During the owner's lifetime, t he beneficiaries have no interest in the property, and 6 
the owner retains full power to transfer or encumber the property or to revoke the TOD 7 
deed.  8 
Thirteen states have enacted statutes authorizing TOD deeds. In the chronological 9 
order of the statutes' ena ctment, the states are: Missouri (1989), Kansas (1997), Ohio 10 
(2000), New Mexico (2001), Arizona (2002), Nevada (2003), Colorado (2004), Arkansas 11 
(2005), Wisconsin (2006), Montana (2007), Oklahoma (2008), Minnesota (2008), and 12 
Indiana (2009).  13 
The time is ri pe for a Uniform Act to facilitate this emerging form of nonprobate 14 
transfer and to bring uniformity and clarity to its use and operation.  15 
PART 4  16 
UNIFORM REAL PROPERT Y TRANSFER ON DEATH ACT  17 
§6-401.  Short title  18 
This Part may be known and cited as "the Unif orm Real Property Transfer on Death 19 
Act."  20 
§6-402.  Definitions  21 
As used in this Part, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms have 22 
the following meanings.  23 
1.  Beneficiary.   "Beneficiary" means a person that receives property under a tran sfer 24 
on death deed.  25 
2.  Designated beneficiary.   "Designated beneficiary" means a person designated to 26 
receive property in a transfer on death deed.  27 
3.  Joint owner.   "Joint owner" means an individual who owns property concurrently 28 
with one or more other i ndividuals with a right of survivorship.  "Joint owner" includes a 29 
joint tenant and tenant by the entirety.  "Joint owner" does not include a tenant in 30 
common or owner of community property without a right of survivorship.  31 
4.  Person.   "Person" means an in dividual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, 32 
partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, 33 
government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality or any other legal or 34 
commercial entity.  35 
5.  Property.   "Property" means an interest in real property located in this State that 36 
is transferable on the death of the owner.  37 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 6.  Transfer on death deed.   "Transfer on death deed" means a deed authorized 1 
under this Part.  2 
7.  Transferor.   "Transferor" means a n individual who makes a transfer on death 3 
deed.  4 
Comment  5 
Paragraph (1) defines a beneficiary as a person that receives property under a transfer 6 
on death deed.  This links the definition of a "beneficiary" to the definition of a "person." 7 
A beneficiary can  be any person, including the trustee of a revocable trust.  8 
Paragraph (2) defines a designated beneficiary as a person designated to receive 9 
property in a transfer on death deed. This links the definition of a "designated 10 
beneficiary" to the definition of a "person." A designated beneficiary can be any person, 11 
including a revocable trust.  12 
The distinction between a "beneficiary" and a "designated beneficiary" is easily 13 
illustrated. Section 13 provides that, on the transferor's death, the property that is the  14 
subject of a transfer on death deed is transferred to the designated beneficiaries who 15 
survive the transferor. If X and Y are the designated beneficiaries but only Y survives the 16 
transferor, then Y is a beneficiary and X is not. A further illustration com es into play if 17 
Section 13 is made subject to the state's antilapse statute. If X fails to survive the 18 
transferor but has a descendant, Z, who survives the transferor, the antilapse statute may 19 
create a substitute gift in favor of Z. In such a case, the de signated beneficiaries are X and 20 
Y, but the beneficiaries are Y and Z. 21 
Paragraph (3) provides a definition of a "joint owner" as an individual who owns 22 
property with one or more other individuals with a right of survivorship. The term is used 23 
in Sections 1 1 and 13.  24 
Paragraph (4) is the standard Uniform Law Commission definition of a "person."  25 
The effect of paragraph (5) is that the act applies to all interests in real property 26 
located in this state that are transferable at the death of the owner.  27 
Paragraph (6) provides that a "transfer on death deed" is a deed authorized under this 28 
act. In some states with existing transfer on death deed legislation, the legislation has 29 
instead used the term "beneficiary deed." The term "transfer on death deed" is preferred,  30 
to be consistent with the transfer on death registration of securities. See Article 6, Part 3, 31 
of the Uniform Probate Code, containing the Uniform TOD Security Registration Act.  32 
Paragraph (7) limits the definition of a "transferor" to an individual. The t erm 33 
"transferor" does not include a corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, 34 
limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, government or 35 
governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, or any legal or comm ercial entity 36 
other than an individual. The term also does not include an agent or other representative. 37 
If a transfer on death deed is made by an agent on behalf of a principal or by a 38 
conservator, guardian, or judge on behalf of a ward, the principal or ward is the 39 
transferor. By way of analogy, see Uniform Trust Code (2000/2005) Section 103(15) 40 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 (defining "settlor") and the accompanying Comment (excluding an individual "acting as 1 
the agent for the person who will be funding the trust"). The power of an ag ent to make or 2 
revoke a transfer on death deed on behalf of a principal is determined by other law, such 3 
as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) (UPC Article 5B), as indicated in the 4 
Comments to Sections 9 and 11 (UPC Sections 6 -409 and 6 -411).  5 
§6-403.  Applicability  6 
This Part applies to a transfer on death deed made before, on or after January 1, 2018 7 
by a transferor dying on or after January 1, 2018.  8 
Comment  9 
This section provides that the act applies to a transfer on death deed made before, on, 10 
or aft er the effective date of the act by a transferor dying on or after the effective date of 11 
the act. This section is consistent with the Uniform Probate Code's provisions governing 12 
transfer on death registration of securities. Those provisions "appl[y] to reg istrations of 13 
securities in beneficiary form made before or after [effective date], by decedents dying on 14 
or after [effective date]." UPC Section 6 -311. 15 
§6-404.  Nonexclusivity  16 
This Part does not affect any method of transferring property otherwise permitt ed 17 
under the law of this State.  18 
Comment  19 
This section provides that the act is nonexclusive. The act does not affect any method 20 
of transferring property otherwise permitted under state law.  21 
One such method is a present transfer with a retained legal life es tate. Consider the 22 
following examples:  23 
Example 1 . A conveys Blackacre to B while reserving A's right to remain in 24 
possession until A's death. By this conveyance, A has made a present transfer of a future 25 
interest to B. The transfer is irrevocable. The futu re interest will ripen into possession at 26 
A's death, even if B fails to survive A. 27 
Example 2 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 28 
Blackacre, naming B as the designated beneficiary. During A's lifetime, no interest passes 29 
to B, and A may revoke the deed. If unrevoked, the deed will transfer possession to B at 30 
A's death only if B survives A. 31 
As illustrated in these examples, the two methods of transfer have different effects 32 
and are governed by different rules.  33 
§6-405.  Transfer  on death deed authorized  34 
An individual may transfer property to one or more beneficiaries effective at the 35 
transferor's death by a transfer on death deed.  36 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 Comment  1 
This section authorizes a transfer on death deed and makes it clear that the transfer is 2 
not an inter vivos transfer. The transfer occurs at the transferor's death.  3 
The transferor is an individual, but the singular includes the plural. Multiple 4 
individuals can readily act together to transfer property by a transfer on death deed, as in 5 
the common  case of a husband and wife who own the property as joint tenants or as 6 
tenants by the entirety. On the effect of a transfer on death deed made by joint owners, 7 
see Section 13(c) and the accompanying Comment.  8 
The transferor may select any form of ownership , concurrent or successive, absolute 9 
or conditional, contingent or vested, valid under state law. Among many other things, this 10 
permits the transferor to reserve interests for the transferor's estate (e.g., mineral 11 
interests); to specify the nature and ext ent of the beneficiary's interest; and to designate 12 
one or more primary beneficiaries and one or more alternate beneficiaries to take in the 13 
event the primary beneficiaries fail to survive the transferor. This freedom to specify the 14 
form and terms of the t ransferee's interest comports with the fundamental principle of 15 
American law recognized by the Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other 16 
Donative Transfers) §10.1 that the donor's intention should be "given effect to the 17 
maximum extent allowed by la w." As the Restatement explains in Comment c to §10.1, 18 
"American law curtails freedom of disposition only to the extent that the donor attempts 19 
to make a disposition or achieve a purpose that is prohibited or restricted by an overriding 20 
rule of law."  21 
Notwi thstanding this freedom of disposition, transferors are encouraged as a practical 22 
matter to avoid formulating dispositions that would complicate title. Dispositions 23 
containing conditions or class gifts, for example, may require a court proceeding to sort 24 
out the beneficiaries' interests. Other estate planning mechanisms, such as trusts, may be 25 
more appropriate in such cases.  26 
§6-406.  Transfer on death deed revocable  27 
A transfer on death deed is revocable even if the deed or another instrument contains 28 
a cont rary provision.  29 
Comment  30 
A fundamental feature of a transfer on death deed under this act is that the transferor 31 
retains the power to revoke the deed. Section 6 is framed as a mandatory rule, for two 32 
reasons. First, the rule prevents an off -record instrumen t from affecting the revocability 33 
of a transfer on death deed. Second, the rule protects the transferor who may wish later to 34 
revoke the deed.  35 
If the transferor promises to make the deed irrevocable or not to revoke the deed, the 36 
promisee may have a remedy  under other law if the promise is broken. The deed remains 37 
revocable despite the promise.  38 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 §6-407.  Transfer on death deed nontestamentary  1 
A transfer on death deed is nontestamentary.  2 
Comment  3 
This section is consistent with Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -101(a), which 4 
provides: "A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in an insurance policy, contract 5 
of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, 6 
account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, comp ensation plan, pension 7 
plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift, 8 
marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a similar nature is 9 
nontestamentary."  10 
As the Comment to Uniform Probate Code Section  6-101 explains, because the mode 11 
of transfer is declared to be nontestamentary, the instrument of transfer is not a will and 12 
does not have to be executed in compliance with the formalities for wills, nor does the 13 
instrument need to be probated.  14 
Whether a document that is ineffective as a transfer on death deed (e.g., because it 15 
has not been recorded before the transferor's death) should be given effect as a 16 
testamentary instrument will depend on the applicable facts and on the wills law of the 17 
jurisdiction . Section 2 -503 of the Uniform Probate Code provides in pertinent part: 18 
"Although a document ... was not executed in compliance with Section 2 -502, the 19 
document ... is treated as if it had been executed in compliance with that section if the 20 
proponent of t he document ... establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the 21 
decedent intended the document ... to constitute ... (iii) an addition to or alteration of the 22 
[decedent's] will ...."  23 
§6-408.  Capacity of transferor  24 
The capacity required to make or re voke a transfer on death deed is the same as the 25 
capacity required to make a will.  26 
Comment  27 
This section provides that the capacity required to make or revoke a transfer on death 28 
deed, which is a revocable will substitute, is the same as the capacity requir ed to make a 29 
will. It is appropriate that a will and a transfer on death deed require the same level of 30 
capacity, for both mechanisms are revocable and ambulatory, the latter term meaning that 31 
they do not operate before the grantor's death. This approach i s consistent with the 32 
Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) §8.1(b), which 33 
applies the standard of testamentary capacity, and not the standard of capacity for inter 34 
vivos gifts, to revocable will substitutes: "If the donative  transfer is in the form of a will, 35 
a revocable will substitute, or a revocable gift, the testator or donor must be capable of 36 
knowing and understanding in a general way the nature and extent of his or her property, 37 
the natural objects of his or her bounty , and the disposition that he or she is making of 38 
that property, and must also be capable of relating these elements to one another and 39 
forming an orderly desire regarding the disposition of the property." This section is also 40 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 consistent with Uniform Trust  Code Section 601: "The capacity required to create, 1 
amend, revoke, or add property to a revocable trust, or to direct the actions of the trustee 2 
of a revocable trust, is the same as that required to make a will."  3 
A transfer on death deed is not affected i f the transferor subsequently loses capacity. 4 
On the ability of an agent under a power of attorney to make or revoke a transfer on death 5 
deed, see the Comments to Sections 9 and 11.  6 
§6-409.  Requirements  7 
A transfer on death deed:  8 
1.  Essential elements and  formalities.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 9 
2, must contain the essential elements and formalities of a properly recordable inter vivos 10 
deed;  11 
2.  Death of transferor.  Must state that the transfer to the designated beneficiary is 12 
to occur at the transferor's death; and  13 
3.  Recorded before transferor's death.  Must be recorded before the transferor's 14 
death in the public records in the registry of deeds in the county where the property is 15 
located.  16 
Comment  17 
Paragraph (1) requires a transfer on dea th deed to contain the same essential elements 18 
and formalities, other than a present intention to convey, as are required for a properly 19 
recordable inter vivos deed under state law. "Essential elements" is a term with a long 20 
usage in the law of deeds of re al property. The essential elements of a deed vary from one 21 
state to another but commonly include the names of the grantor and grantee, a clause 22 
transferring title, a description of the property transferred, and the grantor's signature. In 23 
all states, the essential elements of a properly recordable deed include the requirement 24 
that the deed be acknowledged by the grantor before a notary public or other individual 25 
authorized by law to take acknowledgments. See Thompson on Real Property §92.04(c) 26 
(observing t hat a "certificate of acknowledgment or attestation is universally required to 27 
qualify an instrument for recordation"). In the context of transfer on death deeds, the 28 
requirement of acknowledgment fulfills at least four functions. First, it cautions a 29 
transferor that he or she is performing an act with legal consequences. Such caution is 30 
important where, as here, the transferor does not experience the wrench of delivery 31 
because the transfer occurs at death. Second, acknowledgment helps to prevent fraud. 32 
Third, acknowledgment facilitates the recording of the deed. Fourth, acknowledgment 33 
enables the rule in Section 11 that a later acknowledged deed prevails over an earlier 34 
acknowledged deed.  35 
Paragraph (2) emphasizes an important distinction between an inter vi vos transfer and 36 
a transfer on death. An inter vivos transfer reflects an intention to transfer, at the time of 37 
the conveyance, an interest in property, either a present interest or a future interest. In 38 
contrast, a transfer on death reflects an intention that the transfer occur at the transferor's 39 
death. Under no circumstances should a transfer on death be given effect inter vivos; to 40 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 do so would violate the transferor's intention that the transfer occur at the transferor's 1 
death.  2 
Paragraph (3) requires a transfer on death deed to be recorded before the transferor's 3 
death in the county (or other appropriate administrative division of a state, such as a 4 
parish) where the land is located. If the property described in the deed is in more than one 5 
county, the d eed is effective only with respect to the property in the county or counties 6 
where the deed is recorded. The requirement of recordation before death helps to prevent 7 
fraud by ensuring that all steps necessary to the effective transfer on death deed are 8 
completed during the transferor's lifetime.  The requirement of recordation before death 9 
also enables all parties to rely on the recording system.  10 
An individual's agent may execute a transfer on death deed on the individual's behalf 11 
to the extent permitted by  other law, such as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006). 12 
This act does not define, but instead relies on other law to determine, the authority of an 13 
agent.  14 
§6-410.  Notice, delivery, acceptance, consideration not required  15 
A transfer on death deed is e ffective without:  16 
1.  Notice, delivery or acceptance.  Notice or delivery to or acceptance by the 17 
designated beneficiary during the transferor's life; or  18 
2.  Consideration.  Consideration.  19 
Comment  20 
This section makes it clear that a transfer on death deed i s effective without notice or 21 
delivery to or acceptance by the beneficiary during the transferor's lifetime (paragraph 22 
(1)) and without consideration (paragraph (2)).  23 
Paragraph (1) is consistent with the fundamental distinction under this act between a 24 
transfer on death deed and an inter vivos deed. Under the former, but not under the latter, 25 
the transfer occurs at the transferor's death. Therefore, there is no requirement of notice, 26 
delivery, or acceptance during the transferor's life. This does not mean t hat the 27 
beneficiary is required to accept the property. The beneficiary may disclaim the property, 28 
as explained in Section 14 and the accompanying Comment.  29 
Paragraph (2) is consistent with the law of donative transfers. A deed need not be 30 
supported by cons ideration.  31 
§6-411.  Revocation by instrument authorized; revocation by act not permitted  32 
1.  Revocation by instrument.  Subject to subsection 2, an instrument is effective to 33 
revoke a recorded transfer on death deed, or any part of it, only if the instrume nt: 34 
A.  Is one of the following:  35 
(1)  A transfer on death deed that revokes the deed or part of the deed expressly 36 
or by inconsistency;  37 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 (2)  An instrument of revocation that expressly revokes the deed or part of the 1 
deed; or  2 
(3)  An inter vivos deed that e xpressly revokes the transfer on death deed or part 3 
of the deed; and  4 
B.  Is acknowledged by the transferor after the acknowledgment of the deed being 5 
revoked and recorded before the transferor's death in the registry of deeds in the 6 
county where the deed i s recorded.  7 
2.  More than one transferor.  If a transfer on death deed is made by more than one 8 
transferor:  9 
A.  Revocation by a transferor does not affect the deed as to the interest of another 10 
transferor; and  11 
B.  A deed of joint owners is revoked only if it is revoked by all of the living joint 12 
owners.  13 
3.  Revocation after recorded.  After a transfer on death deed is recorded, it may not 14 
be revoked by a revocatory act on the deed.  15 
4.  Inter vivos transfer.  This section does not limit the effect of an inte r vivos 16 
transfer of the property.  17 
Comment  18 
This section concerns revocation by instrument and revocation by act. On revocation 19 
by change of circumstances, such as by divorce or homicide, see Section 13 and the 20 
accompanying Comment.  21 
Subsection (a) provides t he exclusive methods of revoking, in whole or in part, a 22 
recorded transfer on death deed by a subsequent instrument. Revocation by an instrument 23 
not specified, such as the transferor's will, is not permitted.  24 
The rule that a transfer on death deed may not be revoked by the transferor's 25 
subsequent will is a departure from the Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills and Other 26 
Donative Transfers) §7.2 comment e (see also the corresponding Reporter's Note), which 27 
encourages the revocability of will substitutes b y will. However, there is a sound reason 28 
for the departure in the specific case of a transfer on death deed. A transfer on death deed 29 
operates on real property, for which certainty of title is essential. This certainty would be 30 
difficult, and in many cases  impossible, to achieve if an off -record instrument, such as the 31 
grantor's will, could revoke a recorded transfer on death deed. The rule in this act against 32 
revocation by will is also consistent with the uniform acts governing multiple -party bank 33 
accounts . See Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -213(b) ("A right of survivorship arising 34 
from the express terms of the account, Section 6 -212, or a POD designation, may not be 35 
altered by will.")  36 
A recorded transfer on death deed may be revoked by instrument only by ( 1) a 37 
subsequently acknowledged transfer on death deed, (2) a subsequently acknowledged 38 
instrument of revocation, such as the form in Section 17, or (3) a subsequently 39 
 
 Page 10 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 acknowledged inter vivos deed containing an express revocation clause. Consider the 1 
follo wing examples:  2 
Example 1 . T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 3 
Blackacre. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and records a second transfer on death deed 4 
for Blackacre, containing an express revocation clause revoking "all my pri or transfer on 5 
death deeds concerning this property." The second deed revokes the first deed. The 6 
revocation occurs when the second deed is recorded. (For the result if the second deed 7 
had not contained the express revocation clause, see Example 5.)  8 
Exampl e 2. T executes, acknowledges, and records two transfer on death deeds for 9 
Blackacre. Both deeds expressly revoke "all my prior transfer on death deeds concerning 10 
this property." The dates of acknowledgment determine which deed revoked the other. 11 
The first  deed is acknowledged November 1; the second deed is acknowledged December 12 
15. The second deed is the later acknowledged, so it revokes the first deed. The 13 
revocation occurs when the second deed is recorded.  14 
Example 3 . T executes and acknowledges a transfe r on death deed for Blackacre. T 15 
later executes and acknowledges a revocation form. Both instruments are recorded. 16 
Because the revocation form is acknowledged later than the deed, the form revokes the 17 
deed. The revocation occurs when the form is recorded.  18 
Example 4 . T executes and acknowledges a transfer on death deed for Blackacre. T 19 
later executes and acknowledges an inter vivos deed conveying Blackacre and expressly 20 
revoking the transfer on death deed. Both instruments are recorded. Because the inter 21 
vivos deed contains an express revocation provision and is acknowledged later than the 22 
transfer on death deed, the inter vivos deed revokes the transfer on death deed. The 23 
revocation occurs when the inter vivos deed is recorded. (For the result if the inter v ivos 24 
deed had not contained an express revocation clause, see the discussion below on 25 
"ademption by extinction.")  26 
The same rules apply whether the revocation is total or partial. In the previous 27 
examples, suppose instead that the initial transfer on death deed provides for the transfer 28 
of two parcels, Blackacre and Whiteacre, and that the subsequent instrument revokes the 29 
transfer on death deed as to Blackacre. The subsequent instrument revokes the transfer on 30 
death deed in part.  31 
If the property described i n the original deed is in more than one county, the 32 
revocation is effective only with respect to the property in the county or counties where 33 
the revoking deed or instrument is recorded.  34 
Subsection (a)(1)(A) speaks of revocation "expressly or by inconsiste ncy." This 35 
provision references the well -established law of revocation by inconsistency of wills. 36 
Consider the following examples:  37 
Example 5 . T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 38 
Blackacre naming X as the designated beneficiar y. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and 39 
records a transfer on death deed for the same property, Blackacre, containing no express 40 
revocation of the earlier deed but naming Y as the designated beneficiary. Later, T dies. 41 
 
 Page 11 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 The recording of the deed in favor of  Y revokes the deed in favor of X by inconsistency. 1 
At T's death, Y is the owner of Blackacre.  2 
Example 6 . T, the owner of Blackacre in fee simple absolute, executes, 3 
acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for Blackacre naming X as the 4 
designate d beneficiary. Later, T executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death 5 
deed containing no express revocation of the earlier deed but naming Y as the designated 6 
beneficiary of a life estate (or a mineral interest) in Blackacre. Later, T dies. The 7 
recording of the deed in favor of Y partially revokes the deed in favor of X by 8 
inconsistency. At T's death, Y is the owner of a life estate (or a mineral interest) in 9 
Blackacre, and X is the owner of the remainder.  10 
The question is sometimes raised whether a recorded inter vivos deed without an 11 
express revocation clause  operates as a revocation of an earlier transfer on death deed. 12 
The answer highlights the important distinction between "revocation" and "ademption by 13 
extinction." See Atkinson on Wills §134. Revocation means that the instrument is 14 
rendered void. Ademption by extinction means that the transfer of the property cannot 15 
occur because the property is not owned by the transferor at death. The doctrines are 16 
different.  17 
In some instances, revocation and  ademption have the same practical effect: the 18 
designated beneficiary of the property receives nothing. Nothing in this section changes 19 
that fact, as indicated in subsection (d). However, there are other instances where the 20 
doctrines have differing effects . Consider the following illustration, drawn from the law 21 
of wills.  22 
Example 7 . T executes a will devising Blackacre to A. Later, T becomes legally 23 
incompetent, and G is appointed as T's conservator. G, acting within the scope of his 24 
authority, sells Blacka cre to B for $100,000. Later, T dies. 25 
The law of wills provides that the devise to A is adeemed rather than revoked. This 26 
means that A is not entitled to Blackacre but is entitled to a pecuniary devise in the 27 
amount of $100,000. See UPC Section 2 -606(b); A tkinson on Wills §134; Wasserman v. 28 
Cohen , 606 N.E.2d 901, 903 (Mass. 1993). The result is designed to effectuate T's 29 
presumed intention.  30 
The Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts has begun a 31 
conversation on whether the Uniform Probate Co de's provisions on ademption should be 32 
extended to nonprobate transfers, thus harmonizing the treatment of wills and will 33 
substitutes on this aspect of the law.  34 
This act accepts the well -recognized distinction between revocation and ademption in 35 
order to l eave the door open for such future harmonization, which would effectuate the 36 
presumed intention of nonprobate grantors.  37 
Subsection (b) supplies rules governing revocation by instrument in the event of a 38 
transfer on death deed made by multiple owners. Subse ction (b)(1) provides that 39 
revocation by a transferor does not affect a transfer on death deed as to the interest of 40 
another transferor.  41 
 
 Page 12 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 Subsection (b)(2) provides that a transfer on death deed of joint owners is revoked 1 
only if it is revoked by all of the  living joint owners. This rule is consistent with Uniform 2 
Probate Code Section 6 -306, which provides in pertinent part: "A registration of a 3 
security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or 4 
all then surviving owners  without the consent of the beneficiary." Subsection (b)(2) 5 
applies only to a deed of joint owners. A joint tenant who severs the joint tenancy, 6 
thereby destroying the right of survivorship, is no longer a joint owner.  7 
Subsection (c) provides that a record ed transfer on death deed may not be revoked by 8 
a revocatory act performed on the deed. Such an act includes burning, tearing, canceling, 9 
obliterating, or destroying the deed or any part of it.  10 
This act does not define, but instead looks to other law to de termine, the authority of 11 
an agent. An individual's agent may revoke a transfer on death deed on the individual's 12 
behalf to the extent permitted by other law, such as the Uniform Power of Attorney Act 13 
(2006).  14 
§6-412.  Effect of transfer on death deed durin g transferor's life  15 
During a transferor's life, a transfer on death deed does not:  16 
1.  Affect interest or right of transferor or other owner.  Affect an interest or right 17 
of the transferor or any other owner, including the right to transfer or encumber the  18 
property;  19 
2.  Affect interest or right of transferee.  Affect an interest or right of a transferee, 20 
even if the transferee has actual or constructive notice of the deed;  21 
3.  Affect interest or right of creditor.  Affect an interest or right of a secured o r 22 
unsecured creditor or future creditor of the transferor, even if the creditor has actual or 23 
constructive notice of the deed;  24 
4.  Affect eligibility or public assistance.  Affect the transferor's or designated 25 
beneficiary's eligibility for any form of pub lic assistance;  26 
5.  Create legal or equitable interest.  Create a legal or equitable interest in favor of 27 
the designated beneficiary; or  28 
6.  Subject the property to claims or process.  Subject the property to claims or 29 
process of a creditor of the designat ed beneficiary.  30 
Comment  31 
A fundamental feature of a transfer on death deed under this act is that it does not 32 
operate until the transferor's death. The transfer occurs at the transferor's death, not 33 
before.  34 
Paragraph (1): A transfer on death deed, during th e transferor's lifetime, does not 35 
affect the interests or property rights of the transferor or any other owners. Therefore, the 36 
deed does not, among many other things: affect the transferor's right to transfer or 37 
 
 Page 13 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 encumber the property inter vivos; sever a joint tenancy or a joint tenant's right of 1 
survivorship; trigger a due -on-sale clause in the transferor's mortgage; trigger the 2 
imposition of real estate transfer tax; or affect the transferor's homestead or real estate tax 3 
exemptions, if any.  4 
Paragraph (2 ): A transfer on death deed does not affect transferees, whether or not 5 
they have notice of the deed. Like a will, the transfer on death deed is ambulatory. It has 6 
no effect on inter vivos transfers.  7 
Paragraph (3): A transfer on death deed, during the tran sferor's lifetime, does not 8 
affect pre -existing or future creditors, secured or unsecured, whether or not they have an 9 
interest in the property or notice of the deed.  10 
Paragraph (4): A transfer on death deed, during the transferor's lifetime, does not 11 
affec t the transferor's or designated beneficiary's eligibility for any form of public 12 
assistance, including Medicaid. On this point, the drafting committee specifically 13 
disapproves of the contrary approach of Colo. Rev. Stat. §15 -15-403. 14 
Paragraph (5): During the transferor's lifetime, a transfer on death deed does not 15 
create a legal or equitable interest in the designated beneficiary. The beneficiary does not 16 
have an interest that can be assigned or encumbered. Note, however, that this rule would 17 
not preclude the doctrine of after -acquired title. A warranty deed from a designated 18 
beneficiary to a third party would operate to pass the beneficiary's title to the third party 19 
after the transferor's death.  20 
Paragraph (6): A transfer on death deed, during the transfer or's lifetime, does not 21 
make the property subject to claims or process of the designated beneficiary's creditors. 22 
The deed has no more effect than a will.  23 
If a transferor combines an inter vivos transfer of an interest in property (such as a 24 
mineral intere st) with a transfer on death of the remainder interest, the inter vivos transfer 25 
may have present effect even though the transfer on death does not occur until the 26 
transferor's death.  27 
§6-413.  Effect of transfer on death deed at transferor's death  28 
1.  Upon  death of transferor.  Except as otherwise provided in the transfer on death 29 
deed, in this section or in section 2 -508, 2 -605, 2 -803 or 2 -805 or in Article 2, Part 2, on 30 
the death of the transferor, the following rules apply to property that is the subject  of a 31 
transfer on death deed and owned by the transferor at death.  32 
A.  Subject to paragraph B, the interest in the property is transferred to the designated 33 
beneficiary in accordance with the deed.  34 
B.  The interest of a designated beneficiary is contingent  on the designated 35 
beneficiary surviving the transferor.  The interest of a designated beneficiary that fails 36 
to survive the transferor lapses.  37 
C.  Subject to paragraph D, concurrent interests are transferred to the beneficiaries in 38 
equal and undivided sha res with no right of survivorship.  39 
 
 Page 14 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 D.  If the transferor has identified 2 or more designated beneficiaries to receive 1 
concurrent interests in the property, the share of one that lapses or fails for any reason 2 
is transferred to the other or to the others in  proportion to the interest of each in the 3 
remaining part of the property held concurrently.  4 
2.  Subject to all interests.  Subject to Title 33, section 201, a beneficiary takes the 5 
property subject to all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments, contracts,  mortgages, 6 
liens and other interests to which the property is subject at the transferor's death.  For 7 
purposes of this subsection and Title 33, section 201, the recording of the transfer on 8 
death deed is deemed to have occurred at the transferor's death.  9 
3.  Joint owner.  If a transferor is a joint owner and is:  10 
A.  Survived by one or more other joint owners, the property that is the subject of a 11 
transfer on death deed belongs to the surviving joint owner or owners with right of 12 
survivorship; or  13 
B.  The la st surviving joint owner, the transfer on death deed is effective.  14 
4.  No covenant or warranty of title.  A transfer on death deed transfers property 15 
without covenant or warranty of title even if the deed contains a contrary provision.  16 
Comment  17 
Subsection ( a) states four default rules, except as otherwise provided by the transfer 18 
on death deed, by this section, or by other provisions of state law governing nonprobate 19 
transfers. On this last, and the desirability of extending the probate rules governing 20 
antilapse, revocation on divorce or homicide, survival and simultaneous death, and the 21 
elective share of the surviving spouse to nonprobate instruments such as transfer on death 22 
deeds, see the Legislative Note.  23 
The four default rules established by subsection ( a) are these. First, the property that 24 
is the subject of an effective transfer on death deed and owned by the transferor at death 25 
is transferred at the transferor's death to the designated beneficiaries as provided in the 26 
deed. The rule implements the tran sferor's intention as described in the deed. Consider the 27 
following example:  28 
Example 1 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 29 
Blackacre naming X as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate beneficiary if X fails 30 
to surviv e A. Both X and Y survive A. Blackacre is transferred to X at A's death in 31 
accordance with the provisions of the deed.  32 
This default rule implements the fundamental principle that the provisions of the deed 33 
control the disposition of the property, unless ot herwise provided by state law.  34 
The drafting committee approves of the result in In re Estate of Roloff , 143 P.3d 406 35 
(Kan. Ct. App. 2006) (holding that crops should be transferred with the land under a 36 
transfer on death deed because this result would be re ached on the same facts with any 37 
other deed).  38 
 
 Page 15 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 The bracketed language at the beginning of subsection (a) enables a state to make the 1 
default rules subject to other statutes, such as an antilapse statute or a statute providing 2 
for revocation on divorce. Cons ider the following examples:  3 
Example 2 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 4 
Blackacre naming X as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate beneficiary if X fails 5 
to survive A. In fact, X and Y fail to survive A, who is survived only by X's child, Z. 6 
Assume that the state's antilapse statute applies to transfer on death deeds and creates a 7 
substitute gift in Z. (For such a statute, see Uniform Probate Code Section 2 -706.) 8 
Blackacre is transferred to Z at A's death in acco rdance with the provisions of the deed as 9 
modified by the antilapse statute.  10 
Example 3 . A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 11 
Blackacre naming her spouse, X, as the primary beneficiary and Y as the alternate 12 
beneficiary if X fails to survive A. Later, A and X divorce. Assume that the state's statute 13 
on revocation by divorce applies to transfer on death deeds and revokes the designation in 14 
favor of X, with the effect that the provisions of the transfer on death deed are given 15 
effect as if X had disclaimed. (For such a statute, see Uniform Probate Code Section 16 
2-804.) Assume further that the effect of the putative disclaimer is that X is treated as 17 
having failed to survive A. (See the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act 18 
(1999/2006) Section 6(a)(3)(B) (UPC Section 2 -1106(a)(3)(B).) Blackacre is transferred 19 
to Y at A's death in accordance with the provisions of the deed as modified by the 20 
revocation on divorce and disclaimer statutes.  21 
Note that the property must be owned by t he transferor at death. Property no longer 22 
owned by the transferor at death cannot be transferred by a transfer on death deed, just as 23 
it cannot be transferred by a will. This is the principle of ademption by extinction, 24 
discussed in the Comment to Section  11. 25 
In almost every instance, the transferor will own the property not only at death but 26 
also when the transfer on death deed is executed, but the latter is not imperative. Consider 27 
the following example. H and W, a married couple, hold Blackacre as tenan ts by the 28 
entirety. H executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for Blackacre in 29 
favor of X. W later dies, at which point H owns Blackacre in fee simple absolute. Later, H 30 
dies. Under the law of some states, there may be a question wheth er the transfer on death 31 
deed is effective, given that H executed it when Blackacre was owned, not by H and W, 32 
but by the marital entity. The correct answer is that the transfer on death deed is effective 33 
at H's death because Blackacre is owned by H at H's death. See, e.g., Mitchell v. 34 
Wilmington Trust Co.,  449 A.2d 1055 (Del. Ch. 1982) (mortgage granted by one tenant 35 
by the entirety is not void upon execution but remains inchoate during the lives of both 36 
spouses and becomes a valid lien if the spouse who e xecuted the mortgage survives the 37 
other spouse or if the spouses get divorced).  38 
The second default rule established by subsection (a) is that the interest of a 39 
designated beneficiary is contingent on surviving the transferor. This default rule treats 40 
wills  and will substitutes alike. The interest of a designated beneficiary who fails to 41 
survive the transferor lapses. On the desirability of extending statutory antilapse 42 
protection to will substitutes such as transfer on death deeds, see the Legislative Note.  43 
 
 Page 16 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 The third default rule established by subsection (a) is that concurrent beneficiaries 1 
receive equal and undivided interests with no right of survivorship among them. This 2 
default rule is consistent with the general presumption in favor of tenancy in commo n. 3 
See Powell on Real Property §51.02. The rule is also consistent with Uniform Probate 4 
Code Section 6 -212 governing multiple -party accounts and Section 6 -307 governing the 5 
transfer on death registration of securities.  6 
The fourth and last default rule esta blished by subsection (a) is that, in the event of 7 
the lapse or failure of an interest to be held concurrently, the share that lapses or fails 8 
passes proportionately to the surviving concurrent beneficiaries. Consider the following 9 
example:  10 
Example 4 .  A executes, acknowledges, and records a transfer on death deed for 11 
Blackacre naming X, Y, and Z as the designated beneficiaries. X and Y survive A, but Z 12 
fails to survive A. The transfer on death deed is effective and, in the absence of an 13 
antilapse statute, transfers Blackacre to X and Y. This default rule is consistent with the 14 
transferor's probable intention in the absence of an antilapse statute and also with 15 
Uniform Probate Code Section 2 -604(b) on the lapse of a residuary devise. On the 16 
desirability of e xtending statutory antilapse protection to will substitutes such as transfer 17 
on death deeds, see the Legislative Note.  18 
Subsection (b) concerns the effect of transactions during the transferor's life. The 19 
subsection states an intermediate rule between two e xtremes. One extreme would provide 20 
that transactions during the transferor's life affect the beneficiary only if the transactions 21 
are recorded before the transferor's death. This would unfairly disadvantage the 22 
transferor's creditors and inter vivos transf erees. The other extreme would provide that 23 
transactions during the transferor's life always supersede the beneficiary's interest, even if 24 
the recording act would provide otherwise. Between these two positions is the rule of 25 
subsection (b).  26 
Subsection (b) provides that the beneficiary's interest is subject to all conveyances, 27 
encumbrances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the 28 
property is subject at the transferor's death. "Liens" includes liens arising by operation of 29 
law, such as state Medicaid liens.  30 
The only exception to this rule arises when the state recording act so provides. The 31 
state recording act will so provide only when two conditions are met: (1) the inter vivos 32 
conveyance or encumbrance is unrecorded through out the transferor's life (the legal 33 
fiction in this subsection protects persons who transact with the transferor and record any 34 
time before the transferor's death); and (2) the beneficiary is protected by the recording 35 
act. These two conditions will be me t only in rare instances. Most beneficiaries of transfer 36 
on death deeds are gratuitous, whereas state recording acts typically protect only 37 
purchasers for value. See Powell on Real Property §82.02.  38 
Subsection (c) provides that the survivorship right of a j oint owner takes precedence 39 
over the transfer on death deed. This rule is consistent with the law of joint tenancy and 40 
wills: the right of survivorship takes precedence over a provision in a joint tenant's will.  41 
 
 Page 17 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 Subsection (d) states the mandatory rule tha t a transfer on death deed transfers the 1 
property without covenant or warranty of title. The rule is mandatory for two reasons: 2 
first, to prevent mishaps by uninformed grantors; and second, to recognize that a transfer 3 
on death deed is a will substitute. T he rule of this section is consistent with the 4 
longstanding law of wills. As stated by Sir Edward Coke, "an express warranty cannot be 5 
created by will." Coke on Littleton 386a.  6 
§6-414.  Disclaimer  7 
A beneficiary may disclaim all or part of the beneficiary's  interest as provided by 8 
section 2 -801. 9 
Comment  10 
A beneficiary of a transfer on death deed may disclaim the property interest the deed 11 
attempts to transfer. While this section relies on other law, such as the Uniform 12 
Disclaimer of Property Interests Act (19 99/2006), to govern the disclaimer, two general 13 
principles should be noted.  14 
First, there is no need under the law of disclaimers to execute a disclaimer in 15 
advance.  During the transferor's life, a designated beneficiary has no interest in the 16 
property. Se e Section 12. Nothing passes to the designated beneficiary while the 17 
transferor is alive, hence there is no need to execute a disclaimer during that time.  18 
Second, an effective disclaimer executed after the testator's death "relates back" to the 19 
moment of t he attempted transfer, here the death of the transferor. Because the disclaimer 20 
"relates back," the beneficiary is regarded as never having had an interest in the 21 
disclaimed property. The Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act (1999/2006) 22 
(UPC Articl e 2, Part 11) reaches this result, without using the language of relation back, 23 
in UDPIA Section 6(b)(1): "The disclaimer takes effect as of the time the instrument 24 
creating the interest becomes irrevocable ...." As the Comment to UDPIA Section 6 25 
explains,  "This Act continues the effect of the relation back doctrine, not by using the 26 
specific words, but by directly stating what the relation back doctrine has been interpreted 27 
to mean."  28 
§6-415.  Liability for creditor claims and statutory allowances  29 
A benefic iary of a transfer on death deed is liable for an allowed claim against the 30 
transferor's probate estate and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse and children to 31 
the extent provided in section 6 -107. 32 
Comment  33 
Alternative A defers to other law, such as Uniform Probate Code Section 6 -102, to 34 
establish the liability of a beneficiary of a transfer on death deed for creditor claims and 35 
statutory allowances.  36 
Uniform Probate Code (UPC) Section 6 -102 was added in 1998 to establish the 37 
principle that recipients of nonprobate transfers can be required to contribute to pay 38 
allowed claims and statutory allowances to the extent the probate estate is insufficient. 39 
 
 Page 18 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 The fundamental rule of liability is contained in UPC Section 6 -102(b): "Except as 1 
otherwise provided by statute, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability 2 
to any probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against the decedent's probate 3 
estate and statutory allowances to the decedent's spouse and children to the extent the 4 
estate is  insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The liability of a nonprobate 5 
transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that 6 
transferee." The other provisions of UPC Section 6 -102 implement this liability r ule. 7 
For states not favoring the comprehensive approach of UPC Section 6 -102(b) or the 8 
equivalent, Alternative B provides an in rem liability rule applying to transfer on death 9 
deeds. The property transferred under a transfer on death deed is liable to the  transferor's 10 
probate estate for properly allowed claims and statutory allowances to the extent the 11 
estate is insufficient.  12 
One of the functions of probate is creditor protection. UPC Section 6 -102, referenced 13 
in Alternative A, attempts to provide comprehe nsive creditor protection within the realm 14 
of nonprobate transfers. In addition, this act in Alternative B provides more creditor 15 
protection than is typically available under current law. For many transferors, the transfer 16 
on death deed will be used in lie u of joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Under the 17 
usual law of joint tenancy, the unsecured creditors of a deceased joint tenant have no 18 
recourse against the property or against the other joint tenant. Instead, the property passes 19 
automatically to t he survivor, free of the decedent's debts. See Comment 5 to UPC 20 
Section 6 -102. If the debts cannot be paid from the probate estate, the creditor is out of 21 
luck. Under Alternative B, in contrast, the property transferred under a transfer on death 22 
deed is li able to the probate estate for properly allowed claims and statutory allowances to 23 
the extent the estate is insufficient.  24

What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do? When you die, this deed transfers 5 
the described property, subject to any liens or mortgage s (or other encumbrances) on the 6 
property at your death.  Probate is not required.  The TOD deed has no effect until you 7 
die.  You can revoke it at any time.  You are also free to transfer the property to someone 8 
else during your lifetime.  If you do not o wn any interest in the property when you die, 9 
this deed will have no effect.  10 
How do I make a TOD deed? Complete this form.  Have it acknowledged before a 11 
notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments.  Record the 12 
form in each county where any part of the property is located.  The form has no effect 13 
unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death.  14 
Is the "legal description" of the property necessary? Yes.  15 
How do I find the "legal description" of the property? This infor mation may be on the 16 
deed you received when you became an owner of the property.  This information may 17 
also be available in the registry of deeds for the county where the property is located.  If 18 
you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer.  19 
Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed? Yes.  If you have not yet 20 
recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the 21 
deed.  22 
How do I "record" the TOD deed? Take the completed and acknowledged form to the 23 
registry of deeds of the county where the property is located.  Follow the instructions 24 
given by the register of deeds to make the form part of the official property records.  If 25 
the property is in more than one county, you should record the deed in each county.  26 
Can I later  revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind? Yes.  You can revoke the 27 
TOD deed.  No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.  28 
How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? There are three ways to revoke a 29 
recorded TOD deed :  (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in 30 
each county where the property is located.  (2) Complete and acknowledge a new TOD 31 
deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each county where the property 32 
is located.  (3)  Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime by a recorded 33 
deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed.  You may not revoke the TOD deed by will.  34

 Page 30 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 of the claimant as payee.  Each beneficiary's liability with respect to an unsatisfied 1 
request for payment is limited to the same pro portionate share of the request for payment 2 
as the beneficiary's proportionate share of the account under the beneficiary designation.  3 
Beneficiaries have the right of contribution among themselves with respect to requests for 4 
payment that are satisfied af ter the owner's death, to the extent the requests for payment 5 
would have been enforceable by the payees.  In no event may a beneficiary's liability to 6 
payees, the owner's estate and other beneficiaries under this section and section 6 -530 7 
with respect to a ll requests for payment exceed the value of the account received by the 8 
beneficiary.  If a request for payment that would not have been enforceable under this 9 
section is satisfied from a beneficiary's share of the account, the beneficiary is not liable 10 
to any other payee or the owner's estate under this section or section 6 -530 for the amount 11 
so paid, and the beneficiary has no right of contribution against other beneficiaries with 12 
respect to that amount.  13 
§6-516.  Survival required  14 
1.  Survival by 120 hours .  An individual who is a beneficiary of a nonprobate 15 
transfer is not entitled to a transfer unless the individual survives the owner by 120 hours.  16 
2.  Different period of survival.   If an owner provides and the transferring entity 17 
accepts, or if a governi ng instrument or applicable law provides, a period of survival 18 
different than 120 hours, the period designated determines the survival requirement of 19 
beneficiaries under this section.  An owner and transferring entity may agree that certain 20 
circumstances r aise a different presumption of survival or nonsurvival.  21 
3.  Joint owners.   This section does not apply to survivorship rights of joint owners.  22 
§6-517.  Beneficiary designation designating trustee under trust that is amendable or 23 
revocable; trust that is r evoked, terminated or does not exist at death of 24 
owner  25 
1.  Amendable or revocable trust.   A beneficiary designation designating a trustee 26 
under a trust established or to be established by the owner or some other person, 27 
including a funded or unfunded trust , is not invalid because the trust is amendable or 28 
revocable or both or because the trust was amended after the designation.  29 
2.  Revoked or terminated trust.   Unless a beneficiary designation provides 30 
otherwise, a trust that was revoked or terminated befor e the death of the owner is deemed 31 
not to have survived the owner.  32 
3.  Deemed not to have survived owner.   Unless a beneficiary designation provides 33 
otherwise, a legal entity or trust that does not exist or come into existence at the time of 34 
the owner's de ath is deemed not to have survived the owner.  35 
§6-518.  Disclaimer  36 
If a beneficiary of a nonprobate transfer disclaims in whole or in part the nonprobate 37 
transfer in the manner provided by law, then, with respect to the disclaimed transfer, the 38 
disclaimant is treated as having predeceased the owner unless the beneficiary designation 39 
provides otherwise; but the possibility that a beneficiary or descendant may disclaim a 40 
 
 Page 31 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 transfer does not require any transferring entity to withhold making the transfer in the 1 
normal course of business.  2 
§6-519.  Marriage dissolution or annulment; revocation of transfer to former spouse 3 
or relative of spouse; remarriage to spouse, nullification of annulment  4 
1.  Revocation of beneficiary designation by dissolution or annulment of 5 
marriage.   If, after an owner makes a beneficiary designation, the owner's marriage is 6 
dissolved or annulled, any provision of the beneficiary designation in favor of the owner's 7 
former spouse or a relative of the owner's former spouse is revoked on the dat e the 8 
marriage is dissolved or annulled, whether or not the beneficiary designation refers to 9 
marital status.  The beneficiary designation must be given effect as if the former spouse 10 
or relative of the former spouse had disclaimed the revoked provision.  11 
2.  Irrevocable beneficiary designation.   Subsection 1 does not apply to a provision 12 
of a beneficiary designation that has been made irrevocable, or revocable only with the 13 
spouse's consent, that is made after the marriage was dissolved or that expressly st ates 14 
that marriage dissolution does not affect the designation of a spouse or relative of a 15 
spouse as beneficiary.  16 
3.  Revival by remarriage or nullification.   Any provision of a beneficiary 17 
designation revoked solely by this section is revived by the owne r's remarriage to the 18 
former spouse or by a nullification of the marriage dissolution or annulment.  19 
4.  Relative of the owner's former spouse.   As used in this section, "a relative of the 20 
owner's former spouse" means an individual who is related to the own er's former spouse 21 
by blood, adoption or affinity and who, after the divorce or annulment, is not related to 22 
the owner by blood, adoption or affinity.  23 
§6-520.  Disqualification for fraud, duress and undue influence and causing owner's 24 
death  25 
1.  Fraud, dure ss or undue influence.   A beneficiary designation or a revocation of 26 
a beneficiary designation that is procured by fraud, duress or undue influence is void.  27 
2.  Causing death of owner.   A beneficiary who willfully and unlawfully causes or 28 
participates with  another in causing the death of the owner or of the insured individual 29 
under a life insurance policy or certificate is disqualified from receiving any benefit of a 30 
nonprobate transfer from the owner or any proceeds payable as a result of the death of an 31 
individual insured under a life insurance policy or certificate.  The beneficiary 32 
designation must be given effect as if the disqualified beneficiary had disclaimed it.  The 33 
fact that a beneficiary willfully and unlawfully caused or participated with anothe r in 34 
causing the death of the owner may be established by a criminal conviction or guilty plea, 35 
after all appeal periods have run and those appeal proceedings have concluded, or 36 
determined in a proceeding pursuant to subsection 3 using a preponderance of t he 37 
evidence standard.  38 
3.  Determination by trier of fact.   On petition of any interested person or the 39 
transferring entity, the trier of fact shall determine whether a beneficiary designation or a 40 
 
 Page 32 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 revocation of a beneficiary designation is void by reason o f subsection 1 or whether 1 
subsection 2 applies to prevent any person from receiving any benefit of the nonprobate 2 
transfer.  The trier of fact may mitigate the effect of subsection 1 or 2 on any person as 3 
the trier of fact determines justice requires.  Any  party may demand a jury trial.  4 
§6-521.  Omitted spouse or child; after -born child or after -adopted child  5 
1.  Unintentional disinheritance.   A law intended to protect a spouse or child from 6 
unintentional disinheritance by the will of a testator does not ap ply to a nonprobate 7 
transfer.  8 
2.  Designation by class.   A beneficiary designation designating the children of the 9 
owner or any other person as a class and not by name must include all children of the 10 
person, whether born or adopted before or after the ben eficiary designation is made.  11 
3.  After -born or after -adopted child.   If a beneficiary designation names an 12 
individual who is a child of the owner, and if the owner has a child born or adopted after 13 
the owner makes the beneficiary designation, the after -born or after -adopted child is 14 
entitled to receive a fractional share of any property otherwise transferable to any child of 15 
the owner who is named in the beneficiary designation, computed as follows: the 16 
numerator of the fraction must be one, and the denomi nator must be the total number of 17 
the owner's children, whether born or adopted before or after the beneficiary designation 18 
was made and whether named or not in the beneficiary designation.  The property 19 
otherwise transferable to the owner's children named  in the beneficiary designation must 20 
be reduced in the proportion that their shares bear to each other.  If there is no share 21 
designated for any child of the owner, an after -born or after -adopted child receives no 22 
share of the property subject to the nonpr obate transfer.  23 
4.  Rule of transferring entity concerning after -born child rule.   A beneficiary 24 
designation, a governing instrument or the rules of any transferring entity may provide 25 
that the after -born child rule does not apply, in which case after -born and after -adopted 26 
children of the owner receive no share of property designated for named children of the 27 
owner.  28 
5.  Exception.   A transferring entity has no obligation to apply subsection 3 in 29 
making distribution with respect to property registered in be neficiary form.  This 30 
exception for the transferring entity does not affect the ownership interest of the after - 31 
born or after -adopted child.  32 
§6-522.  Nonprobate transfer rules  33 
1.  Article governs.   The rights and obligations of an owner, beneficiary and 34 
transferring entity in a nonprobate transfer are governed by this Article.  35 
2.  Transferring entity rules when agreement.   When provision for a nonprobate 36 
transfer is a matter of agreement between the owner and the transferring entity pursuant 37 
to section 6 -504, a transferring entity may adopt rules for the making, revocation, 38 
acceptance and execution of beneficiary designations and a transferring entity may adopt 39 
the rules in subsection 3 in whole or in part by incorporation by reference.  40 
 
 Page 33 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 3.  Default rules.   The following rules in this subsection apply to all beneficiary 1 
designations, except as otherwise provided by any governing instrument, the rules of any 2 
transferring entity, applicable law or the beneficiary designation.  3 
A.  A beneficiary designation or a r equest for registration of property in beneficiary 4 
form must be made in writing, signed by the owner and dated.  5 
B.  A beneficiary designation may designate one or more primary beneficiaries and 6 
one or more contingent beneficiaries.  7 
C.  On property register ed in beneficiary form, primary beneficiaries are the persons 8 
shown immediately following the transfer on death direction.  Words indicating that 9 
the persons shown are primary beneficiaries are not required.  If contingent 10 
beneficiaries are designated, the ir names in the registration must be preceded by the 11 
words "contingent beneficiaries," or an abbreviation thereof, or words of similar 12 
meaning.  13 
D.  Unless a different percentage or fractional share is stated for each beneficiary, 14 
surviving multiple primary  beneficiaries or multiple contingent beneficiaries share 15 
equally.  When a percentage or fractional share is designated for multiple  16 
beneficiaries, either primary or contingent, surviving beneficiaries share in the 17 
proportion that their designated shares bear to each other.  18 
E.  Provision for a transfer of unequal shares to multiple beneficiaries for property 19 
registered in beneficiary form may be expressed in the registration by a number 20 
preceding the name of each beneficiary that represents a percentage sh are of the 21 
property to be transferred to that beneficiary.  The number representing a percentage 22 
share need not be followed by the word "percent" or a percent sign.  23 
F.  A nonprobate transfer of property also transfers any interest, rent, royalties, 24 
earning s, dividends or credits earned or declared on the property but not paid or 25 
credited before the owner's death.  26 
G.  If a distribution by a transferring entity pursuant to a nonprobate transfer results 27 
in fractional shares in property that is not divisible, t he transferring entity may 28 
distribute the fractional shares in the name of all beneficiaries as tenants in common 29 
or as the beneficiaries may direct or the transferring entity may sell the property that 30 
is not divisible and distribute the proceeds to the b eneficiaries in the proportions to 31 
which they are entitled.  32 
H.  On the death of the owner, the property, less a setoff for all amounts and charges 33 
owed by the owner to the transferring entity, belongs to the surviving beneficiaries 34 
and their lineal descend ants when required as substitutes as follows:  35 
(1)  If a multiple primary beneficiary does not survive and has no surviving lineal 36 
descendant substitutes, the nonsurviving primary beneficiary's share belongs to 37 
the surviving primary beneficiaries in the pro portion that their shares bear to each 38 
other;  39 
(2)  If no primary beneficiary or lineal descendant substitute survives, the 40 
property belongs to the surviving contingent beneficiaries in equal shares or in 41 
the percentage or fractional share stated;  42 
 
 Page 34 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 (3)  If a  multiple contingent beneficiary does not survive and has no lineal 1 
descendant substitutes, the nonsurviving contingent beneficiary's share belongs to 2 
the surviving contingent beneficiaries in the proportion that their shares bear to 3 
each other; and  4 
(4)  I f no beneficiary survives the owner, the property belongs to the owner's 5 
estate.  6 
I.  If a trustee designated as a beneficiary does not survive the owner, resigns or is 7 
unable or unwilling to execute the trust as trustee and, if within one year of the 8 
owner 's death no successor trustee has been appointed or has undertaken to act, or if a 9 
trustee is designated as beneficiary and no trust instrument or probated will creating 10 
an express trust has been presented to the transferring entity, the transferring entit y 11 
may in its discretion make the distribution as it would be made if the trust did not 12 
survive the owner.  13 
J.  If a beneficiary cannot be located at the time the transfer is made to located 14 
beneficiaries, the transferring entity shall hold the missing benef iciary's share.  If the 15 
missing beneficiary's share is not claimed by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's 16 
personal representative or successors within one year of the owner's death, the 17 
transferring entity shall transfer the share as if the beneficiary di d not survive the 18 
owner. The transferring entity has no obligation to attempt to locate a missing 19 
beneficiary, to pay interest on the share held for a missing beneficiary or to invest the 20 
missing beneficiary's share in any different property.  Cash, intere st, rent, royalties, 21 
earnings or dividends payable to the missing beneficiary may be held by the 22 
transferring entity at interest or reinvested by the transferring entity in the account or 23 
in a dividend reinvestment account associated with property held for  the missing 24 
beneficiary.  25 
K.  If a transferring entity is required to make a nonprobate transfer to a minor or an 26 
adult with a disability, the transfer may be made pursuant to Article 5, Parts 1 to 3; 27 
Title 33, chapter 32; or a similar law of another state . 28 
L.  A written request for execution of a nonprobate transfer may be made by a 29 
beneficiary, a beneficiary's legal representative or attorney in fact or the owner's 30 
personal representative. The request must be under oath or affirmation, be subscribed 31 
befor e a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths and include the 32 
following:  33 
(1)  The full name, address and tax identification number of each beneficiary;  34 
(2)  The percentage or fractional share to be distributed to each beneficiary;  35 
(3)  T he manner in which percentage or fractional shares in nondivisible property 36

person and no known claims that would affect the distribution requested; and  40 
(5)  Such other information as the transferring entity may require.  41 
 
 Page 35 - 128LR0885(01) -1

§6-523.  Transferring entity, protection  10 
1.  Owner gives protections to transferring entity.   The owner in making provision 11 
for a nonprobate transfer under this Part gives to the transferring entity the protections 12 
provided in this section for executing the owner's beneficiary designation.  13 
2.  With or without written request.   The transferring entity may execute a 14 
nonprobate transfer with or without a written request.  15 
3.  Reliance on certificate or report.   The transferring entity may rely and act on:  16 
A.  A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate issued by an off icial or 17 
agency of the place where the death occurred showing the fact, place, date, time of 18 
death and identity of the decedent; or  19 
B.  A certified or authenticated copy of any report or record of a governmental 20 
agency, domestic or foreign, that a person i s missing, detained, dead or alive and the 21

4.  Reliance on written request.   The transferring entity may rely and act on, and has 23 
no duty to verify, information in a written request made by  a person specified in section 24 
6-522, subsection 3, paragraph L, under oath or affirmation and subscribed before a 25 
notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths for execution of the 26 
beneficiary designation.  27 
5.  No duty.   The transferring ent ity has no duty:  28 
A.  To give notice to any person of the date, manner and persons to whom transfer 29 
will be made under the beneficiary designation, except as provided in subsection 6;  30

 Page 36 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 other reason or that would qualify or disqualify an y person to receive a share under 1 
the nonprobate transfer or that would vary the distribution provided in the beneficiary 2 
designation.  3 
6.  Duty based on written notice.   This subsection governs the duty of a transferring 4 
entity based on written notice rece ived by the transferring entity.  5 
A.  The transferring entity has no duty to withhold making a transfer based on 6 
knowledge of any fact or claim adverse to the transfer to be made unless, prior to the 7 
transfer, the transferring entity has received written n otice at a place and time and in a 8 
manner that affords a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the transfer is made 9 
that: 10 
(1)  Asserts a claim of beneficial interest in the transfer adverse to the transfer to 11

(2)  Gives the name of the claima nt and an address for communications directed 13 
to the claimant;  14 
(3)  Identifies the deceased owner and the property to which the claim applies; 15

sending a notice by certified mail to the claimant at the address given in the notice of 20 
claim advising that a transfe r adverse to the claimant's asserted claim may be made in 21 
30 days from the date of delivery or mailing unless the transfer is restrained by a 22 
court order.  If the transferring entity so delivers or mails such a notice, it shall 23

C.  No notice or information other than that described in paragraph A shown to have 26 
been available to the transferring entity, its transfe r agent and their employees affects 27 
the right to the protections provided in this Part.  28

for the application or use of property transferred to a fiduciary that the fiducia ry as such is 30 
entitled to receive.  31 
8.  Require parties to adjudicate or furnish bond.   Notwithstanding the protections 32 
provided the transferring entity in this Part, in the event the transferring entity is uncertain 33 
as to the beneficiary entitled to receiv e a transfer or the beneficiary's proper share, or in 34 
the event of a dispute as to the proper transfer, the transferring entity may require the 35 
parties to adjudicate their respective rights or to furnish an indemnity bond protecting the 36 
transferring entity . 37 
9.  Discharge from all claims.   A transfer by the transferring entity in accordance 38 
with this Part and pursuant to the beneficiary designation in good faith and in reliance on 39 
information the transferring entity reasonably believes to be accurate dischar ges the 40 
transferring entity from all claims for the amounts paid and the property transferred.  41 
 
 Page 37 - 128LR0885(01) -1 
 10.  Protections in addition.   The protections provided a transferring entity in this 1 
Part are in addition to protections provided by other law.  2 
§6-524.  Rights of owners and beneficiaries; improper distribution, liability of 3 
distributee; purchasers from distributee  4 
1.  Protections not applicable to beneficiaries.   Any protection provided to a 5 
transferring entity or to a purchaser or lender for value under this Pa rt has no bearing on 6 
the rights of beneficiaries or others in disputes among themselves concerning the 7 
ownership of the property.  8 
2.  Improper distribution or payment of money.   Unless the payment or transfer 9 
can no longer be questioned because of adjudica tion, estoppel or limitations, a transferee 10 
of money or property pursuant to a nonprobate transfer that was improperly distributed or 11 
paid is liable to return to the transferring entity or deliver to the rightful transferees the 12 
money or property improperl y received and the income earned thereon by the transferee.  13 
If the transferee does not have the property, then the transferee is liable to return the value 14 
of the property as of the date of disposition and the income and gain received by the 15 
transferee fr om the property and its proceeds.  If the transferee has encumbered the 16 
property, the transferee shall satisfy any debt incurred that imposes an encumbrance on 17 
the property, sufficient to release any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the 18 
property. 19 
3.  Good faith purchase or acquisition of security interest after death of owner.   20 
A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a security interest in the 21 
property from a beneficiary of a nonprobate transfer after the death of the owner , in good 22 
faith and in the absence of actual knowledge that the transfer was improper or that the 23 
information in an affidavit, if any, provided pursuant to section 6 -522, subsection 3, 24 
paragraph L is not true, takes the property free of any claims of or li ability to the owner's 25 
estate, creditors of the owner's estate, persons claiming rights as beneficiaries under the 26 
nonprobate transfer or heirs of the owner's estate; a purchaser or lender for value has no 27 
duty to verify sworn information relating to the n onprobate transfer.  The protection 28 
provided by this subsection applies to information that relates to the ownership interest of 29 
the beneficiary in the property and the beneficiary's right to sell, encumber and transfer 30 
good title to a purchaser or lender and does not relieve a purchaser or lender from the 31 
notice imparted by instruments of record respecting the property.  32 
4.  No liability for good faith transfer.   A nonprobate transfer that is improper 33 
because of the application of sections 6 -518 to 6 -521 im poses no liability on the 34 
transferring entity if the transfer was made honestly in good faith, regardless of any 35 
negligence in determining the proper transferees.  The remedy of the rightful transferees 36 
is limited to an action against the improper transfer ees. 37 
§6-525.  Rights of creditors  38 
A deceased owner's creditors, surviving spouse and unmarried minor children have 39 
the rights set forth in section 6 -530 with respect to the value of property passing by 40 
nonprobate transfer.  41

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill enacts as Article 6, Part 4 of the Mai ne Probate Code the Uniform Real 2 
Property Transfer on Death Act, adopted by the Uniform Law Commission in 2009.  The 3 
Prefatory Note and the Comments explain the Act and its provisions in detail.  4 
This bill amends the Maine Probate Code to provide for the no nprobate transfer of 5 
personal property not already covered by Article 6 of the Maine Probate Code by 6 
enacting a new Part 5.  The bill allows the owner of personal property, whether tangible 7 
or intangible, to provide for the transfer of that property to tak e place at the death of the 8 
owner without the property being included in the estate of the deceased owner.  Current 9 
law already provides for "payable on death" accounts and the registration of securities to 10 
be transferred on the death of the owner.  This b ill covers all other personal property but 11 
does not apply to the transfer of real property, which is covered by the new Part 4.  Part 5 12 
is modeled on Missouri law.  13
