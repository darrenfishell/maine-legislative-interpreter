municipal clerk in writing of the candidate1s intent to withdraw and the reason for 
withdrawal. This notice must be signed by the candidate and must be notarized.1 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, removes the 
provision in the bill that repeals the laws governing political activities at the voting place 
and instead amends those laws. The amendment limits to one person the number of 
people who may attend a voting place on behalf of a candidate to communicate with 
voters in the manner permitted under existing law. It provides that a person collecting 
signatures must do so outside of the voting place unless there is a separate room on the 
premises of the voting place that is not accessible from the area where voting occurs. It 
limits the number of signature collectors on any one measure, issue or candidate to 2 and 
states that no more that 2 persons who oppose that measure, issue or candidate for which 
signatures are being collected may be afforded access to the area. It limits the total 
number of measures, issues or candidates for which signatures may be collected to 5. 
The amendment removes a provision in the bill that permits the deposit of absentee 
ballots into a secured drop box accessible only by the municipal election clerk. It also 
removes a section in the bill that makes changes to the laws governing when a notary 
public or other person authorized to administer oaths is prohibited from administering an 
oath on a petition for a direct initiative of legislation or people's veto referendum and 
replaces it with a new section. The new section provides that a notary public or other 
person authorized by law to administer oaths is not authorized to administer an oath for a 
direct initiative of legislation or people's veto referendum petition if that person has 
provided services to initiate the measure or promote that direct initiative of legislation or 
people's veto referendum. Finally, the amendment makes changes to the deadlines 
governing submission of municipal official candidate nomination papers, municipal 
candidate withdrawals and petitions for local option votes on the sale of liquor. These 
deadline changes make those provisions consistent with other deadlines enacted for 
similar submissions under Public Law 2017, chapter 248. 
The fiscal note on the amendment identifies a requirement that municipal election 
clerks provide informational materials to petition circulators describing the laws 
governing the solicitation of signatures at the voting place. This requirement does not 
necessarily require the development of new materials, as a copy of relevant statutory 
sections governing solicitation of signatures at the voting place sufficiently satisfies the 
requirement. A municipality may choose to provide inf 01mational materials of the 
municipality1s own creation but that is an optional method of compliance. Thus, the 
members of the committee on this report find that the provisions identified as a potential 
mandate do not necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue.

Fiscal Note 
Potential State Mandate -Unfunded 
Required Activity Unit Affected Local Cost 
Requires election clerks to develop and provide infom1ational materials to Municipality Moderate 
circulators of petitions describing the laws governing the collection of signatures at statewide 
or outside polling places. This assumes the materials are not developed and 
provided to the clerks by the Secretary of State. 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State associated with this legislation can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
