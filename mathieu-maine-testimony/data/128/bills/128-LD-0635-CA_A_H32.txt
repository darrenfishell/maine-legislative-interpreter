Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium savings -General Fund 
This bill could result in savings to the Legislature's budget. The exact timing and amount of such savings cannot be 
determined because the number of Legislators who will choose to carpool and the specifics of their travel cannot be 
determined. For example, based on the current $0.44 per mile reimbursement rate, if all of the Legislators in a given 
vehicle are traveling from the same location, the savings would be an estimated $0.33 per mile per passenger. Factors 
affecting actual savings include: variations in the origination and destination points of passengers in a vehicle, the 
timing of the travel (session or non-session) and the impact of the cap on daily mileage reimbursement.
