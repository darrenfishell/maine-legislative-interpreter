29 to which the covered  electronic devices are shipped.
30 (3)  A consolidator shall  work cooperatively with manufacturers to ensure  
31 implementation of a practical and feasible financing  system with costs calculated 
32 for televisions  on a basis proportional to the manufacturer's national  market  share 
33 of televisions  each type of covered electronic  device sold in the State multiplied 
34 by the total pounds recycled  and with costs calculated  for video game  consoles

46 department may determine that market  share  de minimus.   A video game  console 
Page 5 - 128LR2931(01)-11 manufacturer whose market share is determined de minimus by the department is 
2 not responsible for payment of a pro rata share of video game consoles  for the 
3 corresponding billing  year.  The total market  shares determined de minimus by 
4 the department must be proportionally allocated  to and paid for by the video 
5 game console manufacturers that have 1/10 of 1%  or more of the market.
6 (2)  Each computer monitor  manufacturer, television manufacturer, desktop 
7 printer manufacturer  and video game console manufacturer shall work  
8 cooperatively with consolidators to ensure  implementation of a practical and

10 manufacturer shall reimburse  a consolidator for allowable costs incurred by that 
11 consolidator.
12 E.  Annually  by January 1st the department shall provide manufacturers of computer  
13 monitors and desktop printers and consolidators with a listing  of each manufacturer's  
14 pro rata share of orphan waste computer monitors and desktop printers.  The 
15 department shall determine  each manufacturer's pro rata share based  on the best 
16 available information, including but not limited  to data provided  by manufacturers 
17 and consolidators  and data from electronic waste collection programs  in other
