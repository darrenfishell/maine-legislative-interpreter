valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the U nited States Constitution, when ratified by the 
legislatures of three-fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as 
the one or the other mode of ratification may be pr oposed by the Congress; now, therefore, be it

including those occurring long before or afterward or for a substantially similar purpose, and
