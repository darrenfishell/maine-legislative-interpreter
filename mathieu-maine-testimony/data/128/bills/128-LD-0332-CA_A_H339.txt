15 A. The applicant shall demonstrate to the comt the specific adverse result or results,

1 3. It specifies that the provisions applicable to a search for records from a foreign 
2 entity provider apply to records that are in the possession or control of the foreign entity 
3 provider. 
4 4. It provides a mechanism for a foreign entity provider or a domestic entity provider 
5 to obtain an extension beyond 14 days to reply to a search warrant through notice to the 
6 law enforcement officer who served the warrant. It strikes from the procedure the 
7 requirement that the foreign entity provider file a request for relief with the court. 
8 5. It provides for production of the requested grand jury documents to the grand jury 
9 and provides that the prosecutor's or the grand jury's address must be included in the 
10 subpoena. 
11 6. It provides in the mechanism for expedited production of records a way for the 
12 provider to request a 14-day period for return of the information if the only adverse result 
13 finding is for the reason of jeopardizing the investigation, undue delay of trial or a 
14 significantly detrimental consequence that is not immediate danger of death or serious 
15 physical injury, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence or 
16 intimidation of a potential witness.
