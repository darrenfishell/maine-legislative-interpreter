18 bill repeals current law governing how the Depmtment of Defense, Veterans and 
19 Emergency Management, Bureau of Maine Veterans' Services issues temporary financial 
20 assistance to veterans in financial crises and in its place authorizes the bureau to provide 
21 grants to private organizations for the purpose of providing financial assistance to 
22 veterans. The amendment strikes that provision and establishes an account within the 
23 bureau for the purpose of issuing temporary emergency financial assistance to veterans 
24 and provides for a transfer of $375,000 from the administrative account of the bureau to 
25 the Other Special Revenue Funds account established by the amendment. The 
26 amendment adds a revision clause to change the name of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' 
27 Services to the Maine Bureau of Veterans' Services throughout the Maine Revised 
28 Statutes.
