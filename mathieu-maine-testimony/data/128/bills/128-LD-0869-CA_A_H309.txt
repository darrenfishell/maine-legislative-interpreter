SUMMARY 
This amendment allows a person to keep an unregistered animal harvested by that 
person for longer than otherwise allowed if the person notifies a game warden within 18 
hours as to the location of that animal and the circumstances preventing the person from 
registering the animal. The bill allows a similar exception but only in circumstances 
when a registration station within a reasonable distance of the person is not open due to a 
holiday or other legitimate reason.

Minor cost increase -General Fund 
This bill creates an exemption that allows a person to keep an unregistered animal they harvest if they notify a game 
warden within 18 hours of the location of the animal and circumstances that prevented the person from registering the 
animal with a registration station. Any additional costs to the Department oflnland Fisheries and Wildlife as a result 
of the exemption are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing resources.
