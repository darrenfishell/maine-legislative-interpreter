SUMMARY  10 
This bill updates technical terminology in the laws g overning warranties applicable to 11 
the manufacture and sale of manufactured homes.  12 
The bill amends the laws governing the Manufactured Housing Board to exempt 13 
student -built modular homes pursuant to an educational program from its jurisdiction for 14 
a maximum  of 2 modular homes annually, clarifies the type of manufactured home that a 15 
licensed mechanic and installer may work on and changes references to "mobile home 16 
park" to "manufactured housing community."  17 
The bill removes a residency requirement for licensed  funeral practitioners and other 18 
licensees of the Board of Funeral Service and clarifies the requirements for an apprentice 19 
to receive credit toward licensure through the Maine Apprenticeship Program.  20 
The bill establishes an exemption from licensure for pu mp installers who are licensed 21 
by the Department of Health and Human Services, Maine Water Well Commission and 22 
repeals the licensure provision for plumbing companies.  The bill also updates technical 23 
language.  24 
The bill repeals a transition provision added to the laws governing the licensing of 25 
social workers in 1987, which is no longer relevant.  26 
In the laws governing real estate brokerage, the bill clarifies that the 3 -year look -back 27 
period applies only to past license denials and not to disciplinary action  resulting in 28 
suspension or revocation, which has no look -back period.  When a licensee leaves an 29 
agency, the designated broker is required to notify the licensee that the broker has 30 
notified the Real Estate Commission but the designated broker is not requ ired to return 31 
the license.  This bill clarifies that a designated broker may delegate functions to an 32 
individual who is affiliated with the agency.  The bill also removes references to "branch 33 
office manager."  34 
The bill removes provisions that require empl oyees of a transient seller to include 35 
with an application for licensure their dates of birth and social security numbers and that 36 
require home repair sellers to submit a photograph with an application for licensure.  37 
 
 Page 21 - 128LR0764(01) -1 
 The bill repeals a reference to an exam ination committee that no longer exists and 1 
makes technical corrections to the laws governing boilers and pressure vessels.  2 
The bill makes nonsubstantive clarifications in the Maine Fuel Board licensing laws 3 
and removes the term "limited" from certain lice nses including energy auditor, tank 4 
installer and wood pellet technician.  5 
The bill restores language concerning the Board of Dental Practice that was 6 
inadvertently omitted from a comprehensive revision of the laws governing dental 7 
practice enacted in the S econd Regular Session of the 127th Legislature.  8
