SUMMARY  13 
This bill implements an owner -operator requirement in the scallop dragging and sea 14 
urchin dragging fisheries. The bill provides that a boa t may not be used to drag for 15 
scallops unless the boat is owned by a scallop dragging license holder and the owner or a 16 
family member is on board.  The bill implements the same ownership requirement for sea 17 
urchin dragging boats and license holders.  The b ill provides certain exceptions to the 18 
boat ownership requirement for illness or disability, for temporary inoperability of the 19 
owner's boat and for sale of the boat named on the license and to allow a license holder 20 
who meets certain requirements but who does not own a boat to continue fishing in the 21 
future.  The bill allows a person who cannot meet the boat ownership requirements to 22 
hold a license to maintain eligibility for a future license in the limited entry scallop 23 
dragging fishery and in the limited  entry sea urchin dragging fishery. The bill also 24 
provides that the holder of a scallop dragging license or a sea urchin dragging license 25 
may operate only the boat named on the license to drag for scallops or sea urchins. The 26 
bill provides certain exceptio ns to the boat operation requirement for illness or disability, 27 
for temporary inoperability of the boat and for sale of the boat named on the license.  The 28 
bill requires the Commissioner of Marine Resources to provisionally adopt rules 29 
establishing a limit ed entry system in the scallop fishery no later than January 12, 2018.  30
