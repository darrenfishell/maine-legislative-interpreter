SUMMARY  18 
This bill adds to the protections of t he victim notification laws by requiring victim 19 
notification of funeral and deathbed visits by prisoners, by adding to the definition of 20 
"victim" a person who has obtained from a court a protection from abuse order or 21 
received court approval for a protecti on from abuse consent agreement and by allowing 22 
victims to request notification directly from the Department of Corrections.  23 
It allows a court to revoke the probation of an offender who has contact with a victim 24 
during incarceration if contact has been pro hibited by a condition of probation or by the 25 
department.  26 
It also eliminates 2 redundant statutory provisions regarding the department's Victim 27 
Services Coordinator and allows the Commissioner of Corrections to delegate supervision 28 
of the coordinator.  29
