Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Adding spouses and registered domestic partners to the list of relatives who are potentially responsible for the burial 
or cremation costs of a person who was eligible to receive municipal general assistance at the time of that person's 
death and striking the provision of law that restricts potentially responsible relatives to persons who live or own 
property in Maine will result in savings to the Department of Health and Human Services. The savings to the 
department are not expected to be significant because the frequency of general assistance paying for cremation or 
burial is very low. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible because recipient data related to 
number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number ofrecipients who return and the type of 
assistance provided resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
