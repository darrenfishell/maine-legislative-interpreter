This amendment changes the length of the funding in the bill from on-going to only for 4 years, fiscal year 2017-18 
through fiscal year 2020-21. The amount of annual funding over these 2 biennia is not changed, so there is no 
incremental change expressed above in those years. Only the text of the initiatives is changed to reflect the ending of · 
funding after 4 years.
