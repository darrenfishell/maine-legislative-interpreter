6 SUMMARY
7 This bill repeals the definition of "eating and lodging place" in the laws regarding 
8 campgrounds, recreational camps, youth camps  and eating establishments  and removes 
9 references to the term in other  provisions  of law.  It clarifies the definition of "eating  
10 establishment" to provide  exceptions  to a broad definition and amends other provisions of 
11 law to agree with the  changes.
