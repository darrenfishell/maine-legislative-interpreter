The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as 10

Department of Labor,  Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount 14 
of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢  the average 15 
minimum hourly wage in the New England states of New Hampshire, Vermont, 16 
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhod e Island on July 1st of the previous year, as 17 
determined annually by the Commissioner of Labor .  If the highest federal minimum 18 
wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this section, the 19 
minimum wage under this section is increased t o the same amount, effective on the same 20 
date as the increase in the federal minimum wage , and must be increased in accordance 21 
with this section thereafter . 22

2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 25 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 26 
established in this section.  Starting January 1, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid 27 
directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour, and the tip 28 
credit may not exceed the difference between the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 29 
tipped service employee and the minimum hourly wage established under subsection 1.  30 
Starting January 1,  2018, and on each January 1st thereafter, the minimum cash wage 31 
paid directly to a tipped service employee must be increased by an additional $1.00 per 32 
hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage 33 
established under su bsection 1, except that if the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 34 
tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less than the annually adjusted minimum 35 
hourly wage, it must be increased by that lesser amount  the minimum cash wage paid 36 
directly to a tipped s ervice employee may not be less than 50% of the minimum hourly 37 
wage established under subsection 1 .  An employer who elects to use the tip credit , until 38 
it is eliminated under this subsection,  must inform the affected employee in advance and 39 
must be able t o show that the employee receives at least the minimum hourly wage when 40 
direct wages and the tip credit are combined.  Upon a satisfactory showing by the 41 
employee or the employee's representative that the actual tips received were less than the 42 
tip credit,  the employer shall increase the direct wages by the difference.  43

 The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 1 
not be shared with the employer.  Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 2 
bill or that are c harged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 3 
employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 4 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 5 
reimbursemen t from a credit card company.  6
