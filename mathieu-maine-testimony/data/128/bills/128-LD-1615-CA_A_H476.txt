19 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill. It 
20 repeals the provision of law allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to 
21 determine reasonable suspicion of illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse by 
22 recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, assistance by means 
23 other than through the use of a written screening tool. It applies the procedures for 
24 applicants contained in the bill to current recipients of TANF assistance with felony drug 
25 convictions in the last 20 years. It requires a recipient of TANF assistance who is 
26 convicted of a drug conviction of any kind after October 1, 2017 to be enrolled in a 
27 substance abuse treatment program in order to retain TANF assistance. The amendment 
28 also clarifies that denial of assistance applies only to an adult and not to the eligible 
29 children in the adult's household. This amendment adds an appropriations and allocations 
30 section.

to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 
$288,329 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $296,83 9 in fiscal year 2018-19 for the written screening tool utilized for the 
comprehensive substance abuse screening and for 3 Senior Planner positions to conduct and score the comprehensive 
substance abuse screening, schedule drug tests and make referrals to treatment programs. 
There could be potential increases in MaineCare costs or DHHS Substance Abuse treatment contracts due to 
increased enrollment in treatment programs if more individuals enter the program due to this policy change. There is 
not enough information cu1Tently known about this impact and this fiscal note does not include an estimate of any of 
these potential costs.
