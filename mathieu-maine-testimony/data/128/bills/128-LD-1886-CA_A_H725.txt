employment and other professionals working with Maine's veteran population as a 
significant barrier to veterans' accessing health care, training, employment and basic 
services; and

an opportunity to test targeted transportation service to veterans but also will enable the 
focused collection of veteran-specific data to inform the development of a sustainable 
means to meet veterans' transportation needs statewide; and 
Whereas, the need for the development of a sustainable means to meet veterans' 
transportation needs means that the pilot project should begin as soon as funding is 
available in the next fiscal year; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it'
