Amend the bill in section 7 in § 1367 in subsection 1 in the last line (page 3, line 5 in 
L.D.) by inserting after the following: "paragraph A." the following: 'A farmers' market 
may allow up to 2 dates per month on which a licensee described in this subsection may

SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the provisions in the bill that permit a manufacturer who 
takes part in a taste-testing event to also sell the manufacturer's products at that event for 
off-premises consumption. The bill eliminates the requirement that a manufacturer 
provide advance notice to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations that the manufacturer is selling its 
product at a farmers' market. The amendment maintains that requirement and requires 
that notice of a taste-testing event also be provided to the bureau. The amendment 
clarifies that spirits sold by a small distillery at a farmers' market may be sold in the same 
manner as permitted under current law when a small distillery sells spirits from its 
manufacturing facility for off-premises consumption. The amendment maintains the 
authorization in the bill that manufacturers of liquor may conduct a taste testing at 
farmers' markets. The amendment specifies that the manufacturer must comply with the 
bylaws of the farmers' market in order to conduct a taste testing and that a farmers' 
market is limited to 2 taste-testing events per month at which a manufacturer may offer 
the manufacturer's product for taste testing.
