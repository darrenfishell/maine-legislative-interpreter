Page 1 - 128LR3075(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  22 MRSA  ยง4011-A,  sub-ยง10  is enacted  to read:
3 10.  Failure to report; penalty.   A person required by this section  to report or cause 
4 a report  to be made to the department or the appropriate district attorney's office who fails 
5 to make a report or cause a report to be made  to the department or the appropriate  district 
6 attorney's office is guilty of failure to report.  Failure  to report is a Class E crime  that, 
7 notwithstanding Title 17-A, section 1252, is punishable by imprisonment for not more  
8 than 30 days or, notwithstanding Title 17-A, section 1301, a fine of not more than $500.  
9 The department shall refer any violations of this subsection to the appropriate district 
10 attorney's office.
11 SUMMARY
12 Current law requires certain persons to report or cause a report  to be made  to the 
13 Department of Health and Human Services or the appropriate district attorney's office 
14 when they know  or have reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been  or is likely to 
15 be abused  or neglected  or that a suspicious child  death has occurred.  This bill 
16 criminalizes the failure of a person to meet this requirement.   Under  current law, such a 
17 person commits a civil violation.   Under this bill, failure  to report or cause a report  to be 
18 made is also a Class E crime,  punishable  by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment  
19 for not more than  30 days.
