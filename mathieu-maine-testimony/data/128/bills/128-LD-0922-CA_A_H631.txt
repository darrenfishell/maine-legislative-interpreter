18 COMMIITEE AMENDMENT·#• to H,P. 650, L.D, 922 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, removes the 
provisions of the bill that direct the Commissioner of Marine Resources to develop a 
management plan for anadromous fish in Sheepscot Pond and that direct the 
Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to cooperate in that effort. The 
amendment delays until 2020 the requirement in the bill that the Commissioner of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife open and keep operational the fishway at the outlet of Sheepscot 
Pond from April 15th to June 30th annually to allow the passage of anadromous fish. The 
amendment also requires the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to provide, 
no later than January 15, 2020, a report to the joint standing committees of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over inland fisheries and wildlife and marine resources 
matters detailing how the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, with the 
cooperation of the Department of Marine Resources, as necessary, will address concerns 
related to opening the fishway regarding managing any biosecurity concerns at the 
Palermo Rearing Station on Sheepscot Pond, allowing lamprey eels to exit Sheepscot 
Pond and managing the migration of alewives out of Sheepscot Pond. The amendment 
allows each joint standing committee to report out legislation based on the report to the 
Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.
