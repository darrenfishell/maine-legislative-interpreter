128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 202, L.D. 587, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
Fees To Be Charged for Wild Game Dinners" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Allow Civic and Charitable Organizations To Serve Wild Game 
Dinners' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 12 MRSA ยง11217, sub-ยง2, ,rI is enacted to read: 
I. A civic or charitable organization may serve meat from lawfully killed and 
registered, if required by this Part, wild game that was donated to that organization as 
part of a meal at a wild game dinner. For the purposes of this paragraph, "wild game 
dinner" means a single event where meat from an animal lawfully taken under this 
Part is cooked and sold to persons at the event for immediate consumption.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, removes the 
provisions of the bill that allow a person to sell the meat of a lawfully killed wild animal 
at a wild game dinner or to the organizer of a wild game dinner, instead providing that a 
civic or charitable organization may serve at a wild game dinner meat from lawfully 
killed wild game that was donated to that organization.
