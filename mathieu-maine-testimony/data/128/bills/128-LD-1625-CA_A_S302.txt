Costs related to ranked-choice voting were estimated in the fiscal note for LD 1557 of the I 27th Legislature, which 
was introduced as Initiated Bill 2 in response to a successful citizens initiated petition drive. As LD 1557 was 
indefinitely postponed, there was no opportunity to put funding for the Secretary of State (SOS) or the Department of 
Public Safety (DPS) into that bill. Subsequent approval by the voters in November of 2016 meant any funding would 
have to wait for implementing legislation. Repealing ranked-choice voting will eliminate any costs that would have 
been incurred by the SOS and the DPS. Costs had been estimated at approximately $850,000 tb the General Fund the 
first year and $740,000 annually thereafter and $52,000 to the Highway Fund annually. As no funding has ever been 
budgeted, no savings will be booked on repeal.
