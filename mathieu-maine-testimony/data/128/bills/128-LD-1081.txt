 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §4401, sub -§4, ¶D -6, as amended by PL 2013, c. 126, §1, 2 
is further amended to read:  3 
D-6.  A division accomplished by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners of 4 
land abutting that land does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, 5 
unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this subchapter.  If the 6 
real estate exempt under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years to anoth er person 7 
without all of the merged land, then the previously exempt division creates a lot or 8 
lots for the purposes of this subsection.  9 
SUMMARY  10 
Current law provides an exemption to the laws governing subdivisions for a division 11 
of a tract or parcel of lan d accomplished by the transfer of any interest in the land to the 12 
owners of land abutting that land and removes that exemption if the exempt real estate is 13 
transferred within 5 years to another person without all of the merged land.  This bill 14 
eliminates t he language that provides for the removal of the exemption.  15
