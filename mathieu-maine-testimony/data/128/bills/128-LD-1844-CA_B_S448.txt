of the sale. The department may notify the Governor and the Legislative Council. The

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the State's right of first refusal over property offered for sale that is over 5,000 acres and that is 
subject to the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law program. Any land purchases under this bill will require additional 
appropriations to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF). As this bill does not require the 
ACF to act on any options to purchase land, no appropriation is required at this time and no costs are incuned. 
If the State chooses to execute a right of first refusal, the lands acquired would be classified as public nomeserved 
land managed by ACF. As public nomeserved lands, ACF is pe1111itted to sell the resources present on those lands or 
in certain situations assess user fees for access to the land. Under cunent law, 25% of revenue generated from public 
nonreserved land is returned to the municipality in which the land is located. This bill requires that ACF also make 
payments in lieu of taxes in an amount equal to what a private landowner would have paid to the assessing authority. 
The State does not cmTently make such payments to municipalities for public nonreserved lands. These payments 
would require ongoing General Fund appropriations.
