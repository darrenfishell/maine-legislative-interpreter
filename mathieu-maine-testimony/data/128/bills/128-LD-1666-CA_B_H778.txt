Potential State Mandate -Unfunded 
State Mandates 
Required Activity Unit Affected 
Requires each school administrative unit (SAU) to convene a stakeholder group to: School 
1) determine status of implementing a proficiency-based system; 2) provide an 
assessment of work needed to be done in order to meet established deadlines; and 3) 
develop and provide appropriate training for all educators in proficiency-based 
system. Also requires each SAU to form a steering committee to regularly review 
and refine the SAU's proficiency-based system to ensure that it meets requirements 
and is aligned with SAU's goals and priorities. Local Cost 
Significant 
statewide 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
l?iscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to provide the required technical assistance to SAU's in 
implementing proficiency-based systems can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
