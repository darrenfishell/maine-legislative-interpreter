'Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §683, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2009, c. 213, Pt. YYY, §1 
and affected by c. 652, Pt. A, §63, is further amended to read: 
1. Exemption amount. Except for assessments for special benefits, the just value of 
$10,000 of the homestead of a permanent resident of this State who has owned a 
homestead in this State for the preceding 12 months is exempt from taxation. 
Notwithstanding this subsection, a permanent resident of this State who loses ownership 
of a homestead in this State due to a tax lien foreclosure and subsequently regains 
ownership of the homestead from the municipality that foreclosed on the tax lien is 
deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be determined ineligible 
for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of the homestead by the 
municipality. In determining the local assessed value of the exemption, the assessor shall 
multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current just value upon which the 
assessment is based as furnished in the assessor's annual return pursuant to section 383. 
If the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in common with others, the 
exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the homestead, but may be

interests. A municipality responsible for administering the homestead exemption has no 
obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest in a homestead owned 
jointly or in common.'

This amendment removes the requirement for a separate notice to the taxpayer of potential eligibility to file for tax 
abatement. As the mandate for a separate notice is removed, the costs anticipated from increased abatement activity 
originating from the notification would not be considered mandated costs and the General Fund appropriation is 
reduced by $824,655 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The mandated requirements to engage a real estate broker, sell 
the property at fair market value or the price anticipated by the broker and remit excess proceeds to the taxpayer 
remain in the bill. As amended, the bill still contains an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $600 beginning in 
fiscal year 2018-19 to cover these costs. This amount represents 90% of the estimated net cost to municipalities not 
recovered through the sale of the property.
