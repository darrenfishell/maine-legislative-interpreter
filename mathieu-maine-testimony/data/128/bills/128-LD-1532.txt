tracks with the express written approval of the track, and with the express written 30 
approval of an association of horsemen as defined in section 272 -B, if credible evidence 31 
is presented that demonstrates that fewer race days is in the best interest of Maine's 32 
harness racing industry.  The award of fewer race days than set forth in section 275 -A, 33 
subsection 1 may not affect the status of those tracks as commercial tracks pursuant to 34 
section 299 .  In assigning race dates to licensees, the commission shall consider the 35

licensee and the suitability o f the applicant's racing facilities for operation at the 42 
season for which the race dates are requested;  43 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0707(01) -1 
 C.  The necessity of having and maintaining proper physical facilities for racing 1 
meetings; and consequently, to insure  ensure  the continuance of the fa cilities, the 2 
quality of the licensee's maintenance of its track and plant, the adequacy of its 3 
provisions for rehabilitation and capital improvements and the necessity of fair 4 
treatment of the economic interests and investments of those who, in good faith , have 5 
provided and maintained racing facilities;  6 
D.  The desirability of reasonable consistency in the pattern of race date assignments 7 
from year to year;  8 
E.  With respect to agricultural societies seeking licenses to conduct harness racing 9 
meets at the t ime of their annual fairs, the scheduling of agricultural fairs determined 10 
by the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry pursuant to Title 7, 11 
sections 83 and 84;  12 
F.  The preservation of a diversity of harness racing tracks in the State;  13 
G.  The quality of the licensee's observance and enforcement of this chapter and the 14 
rules promulgated  adopted  pursuant to this chapter during the past year;  15

this chapter and the rules promulgated  adopted  pursuant to this chapter;  19 
J.  The likely availability of race -worthy horses throughout the year with a goal of 20 
promoting full car ds and avoiding 5 -horse fields ; and  21 
K.  Such other criteria consistent with the betterment of harness racing and the public 22 
health, safety and welfare as the commission may establish by rule.  23 
Sec. 10.  8 MRSA §271, sub -§5, as amended by PL 1995, c. 408, §3 , is further 24 
amended to read:  25 
5.  Minimum number of race dates.   The commission may assign a commercial 26 
licensee a minimum number of race dates for a period of up to 3 years.  The specific 27 
calendar dates for the minimum number of race dates and any additio nal race dates are 28 
determined each year in accordance with subsection 1.  For the purposes of this 29 
subsection, "commercial licensee" means a licensee with an annual total of more than  at 30 
least 25 race dates with pari -mutuel wagering in the previous calenda r year.  31 
Sec. 11.  8 MRSA §271, sub -§7, as reallocated by RR 1997, c. 1, §5, is amended 32 
to read:  33 
7.  Hearing on horse supply.   Prior to August 31st of each year, the commission 34 
shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the horse supply in the State has b een 35 
adequate for the number of dashes conducted on assigned race dates.  If the commission 36 
concludes that the horse supply has been inadequate, the commission shall limit to the 37 
extent necessary the number of dashes that a licensee may race on any date aft er August 38 
1st of that year that has been assigned to more than one track.  The commission may not 39 
restrict the number of dashes to fewer than 10 8. 40 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0707(01) -1 
 Sec. 12.  8 MRSA §271, sub -§9, as reallocated by RR 1997, c. 1, §7, is repealed.  1 
Sec. 13.  8 MRSA §272 -C, su b-§§1 and 2, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 490, §2, 2 
are amended to read:  3 
1.  Establishment; deposits.  A licensee conducting live racing in the State shall 4 
establish a trust account for the benefit of the persons who race horses at that licensee's 5 
facility.  E xcept as provided by subsection 3, funds distributed to or retained by the 6 
licensee pursuant to sections 287, 289, 290, 292 and 298 and Title 7, section 91, less any 7 
administrative assessments pursuant to section 267 -A, that must be used to pay or 8 
suppleme nt harness racing purses must be deposited in that account and used exclusively 9 
to pay harness racing purses.  The funds in a trust account established in accordance with 10 
this subsection are not considered to be property of the licensee, may not be pledged  as 11 
security for the debts of the licensee and are not subject to attachment or execution by 12 
creditors of the licensee.  The commission may adopt rules to provide for the allocation of 13 
purse money and oversight of the trust account.  Rules adopted pursuant  to this 14 
subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 15 
2.  Payment if licensee fails to conduct racing.  If a licensee ceases to operate and 16 
therefore  fails to conduct a race meet  racing  during any of the assigned  race dates in  a 17 
calendar year, all funds not committed to pay purses  held in the trust account established 18 
under this section by that licensee must be returned within 15 days  to the commission, 19 
which shall return to the licensee any amount that represente d a reimbursement that 20 
equaled an overpayment of harness racing purses.  Any remaining balance of the trust 21 
account must be redistributed by the commission to the trust accounts of all racetracks 22 
that continue to conduct live racing in the State, with each  track receiving that portion of 23 
money determined by multiplying the amount of money available for redistribution by a 24 
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of race dates at that racing facility during 25 
the prior calendar year and the denominator o f which is the total number of race dates 26 
throughout the State during that year, except that those funds received by a licensee 27 
pursuant to section 298 must be returned to the fund to supplement harness racing purses 28 
established in section 298 and must be distributed according to that section.  29 
Sec. 14.  8 MRSA §275 -A, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 490, §3, is further 30 
amended to read:  31 
1.  Commercial track.   "Commercial track" means a any harness horse racing track 32 
that is a for -profit business and is  licensed under this chapter to conduct harness horse 33 
racing with pari -mutuel wagering that : is not associated with an agricultural fair as 34 
defined in Title 7, section 81 and that:  35 
A.  If the population of the region is 300,000 or more, based on the 1990 U.S. 36 
Census, conducted racing on more than 100 69 days in each of the previous 2 37 
calendar years, except that if a racetrack that qualifies as a commercial track under 38 
this paragraph ceases operation, a separate racetrack operated by the owner or 39 
operator of the  racetrack that ceased operation qualifies as a commercial track, and 40 
for all purposes is considered the same commercial track as the track that ceased 41 
operation, if the population of the region of that separate racetrack is 300,000 or 42 
more, based on the 1 990 U.S. Census, and the sum of the number of days on which 43 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR0707(01) -1 
 racing was conducted at the track that ceased operation and the number of days on 1 
which racing was conducted at the separate racetrack equals at least 100 70 days in 2 
each of the 2 preceding calend ar years;  3 
B.  If the population of the region is less than 300,000, based on the 1990 U.S. 4 
Census, conducted racing on more than 25 34 days in each of the previous 2 calendar 5 
years, except that if a racetrack that qualifies as a commercial track under this  6 
paragraph ceases operation, a separate racetrack operated by the owner or operator of 7 
the racetrack that ceased operation qualifies as a commercial track, and for all 8 
purposes is considered the same commercial track as the track that ceased operation, 9 
if the population of the region of that separate racetrack is less than 300,000, based on 10 
the 1990 U.S. Census, and the sum of the number of days on which racing was 11 
conducted at the track that ceased operation and the number of days on which racing 12 
was condu cted at the separate racetrack equals at least 26 35 days in each of the 2 13 
preceding calendar years;  14 
C.  Began operation after January 1, 2014 in a region with a population of 300,000 or 15 
more, based on the 1990 U.S. Census, to replace a commercial track as  defined by 16 
paragraph A that ceased operation after January 1, 2014 and for which no separate 17 
racetrack has been opened by the owner or operator of that commercial track that 18 
ceased operation.  For purposes of this paragraph, a racetrack is not required to  have 19 
conducted racing during the 2 preceding calendar years but is required to conduct 20 
racing on at least 100 70 days during each calendar year after the track is initially 21 
licensed as a commercial track.  If a commercial track under this paragraph has no t 22 
been granted 100 70 race days by the commission for the initial calendar year of 23 
operation, race days conducted during that year by the commercial track that ceased 24 
operation after January 1, 2014 are credited to the replacement commercial track; or  25 
D.  Began operation after January 1, 2014 in a region with a population of less than 26 
300,000, based on the 1990 U.S. Census, to replace a commercial track as defined by 27 
paragraph B that ceased operation after January 1, 2014 and for which no separate 28 
racetrack  has been opened by the owner or operator of that commercial track that 29 
ceased operation.  For purposes of this paragraph, a racetrack is not required to have 30 
conducted racing during the 2 preceding calendar years but is required to conduct 31 
racing on at le ast 25 35 days during each calendar year after the track is initially 32 
licensed as a commercial track.  If a commercial track under this paragraph has not 33 
been granted 25 35 race days by the commission for the initial calendar year of 34 
operation, race days c onducted during that year by the commercial track that ceased 35 
operation after January 1, 2014 are credited to the replacement commercial track.  36 
For the purposes of this subsection, "region" is determined by measuring a distance of 50 37 
miles from the center of the racing track along the most commonly used roadway, as 38 
determined by the Department of Transportation, drawing a circle around the center of 39 
the racing track using that 50 -mile measurement and excluding those municipalities or 40 
unorganized territories  that do not have boundaries contained entirely by that circle.  41 
Sec. 15.  8 MRSA §275 -A, sub -§9-A, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 408, §5, is 42 
amended to read:  43 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR0707(01) -1 
 9-A.  Race date.   "Race date" means a scheduled date awarded by the commission 1 
pursuant to section 271  for which there is a  racing program of not less than 8 separate live 2 
races.  In the event of cancellation of a portion of the scheduled racing program due to 3 
weather, power failure or a decision to cancel by the presiding judge on duty, a minimum 4 
of 5 liv e races actually raced constitutes a race date.  If a licensee schedules separate 5 
programs for both an afternoon and an evening on the same calendar day and each 6 
program qualifies as a race date under this subsection, that licensee is granted one race 7 
date for each program.  8 
Sec. 16.  8 MRSA §275 -A, sub -§9-B is enacted to read:  9 
9-B.  Race day.  "Race day" means a scheduled day of racing awarded by the 10 
commission pursuant to section 271 on which racing occurred.  11 
Sec. 17.  8 MRSA §275 -A, sub -§10-A, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 408, §6, is 12 
amended to read:  13 
10-A.  Regular meeting.   "Regular meeting" means the period of time from the first 14 
date a licensee is authorized to conduct live racing through the last date a licensee is 15 
authorized to conduct live racing, exclu ding periods of time longer than 14 days when the 16 
licensee is not authorized to conduct live racing.  Notwithstanding this subsection, the 17 
regular meeting of a licensee that is licensed to conduct live racing in at least 6 separate 18 
calendar months includes  the entire calendar year.  19 
Sec. 18.  8 MRSA §275 -N, as amended by PL 2015, c. 200, §2, is further amended 20 
to read:  21 
§275 -N.  Limitations on off -track betting facilities  22 
The commission may allow interstate simulcasting and license any off -track betting 23 
facility regardless of the number of race dates that were conducted in the State for any 24 
calendar year.  Interstate simulcasting always must be allowed at any commercial track 25 
that conducted at least 136 race dates during the immediately preceding 2 calendar ye ars 26 
or at an existing commercial track as defined in section 275 -A, subsection 1, paragraph B 27 
at which at least 35 race dates were conducted during the preceding 2 years if the 28 
interstate simulcasting at the commercial track is conducted during the regular  meeting .  29 
For the purposes of this section, any race date that the commission determines was 30 
canceled due to a natural or other disaster must be counted as a race date.  For the 31 
purposes of this section and for the purpose of meeting the requirements of s ection 32 
275-A, subsection 1, any race date that is canceled at a commercial race track due to the 33 
inability to meet the requirements of section 275 -A, subsection 9 -A because of a horse 34

credited to the fund established by th is section as of the last day of the preceding month 23 
and not distributed before that day must be distributed to each commercial track licensed 24

adjusted so that for the prior 3 time periods each commercial track receives that fraction 31 
of the total money d istributed over the full year from the fund established by this section, 32 
the amount determined by multiplying the total amount of money times a fraction, the 33 
numerator of which is the number of live race days conducted  day credits actually earned  34

 Page 11 - 128LR0707(01) -1 
 region that is owned by the same owner as the commercial track that ceased operation, all 1 
amounts credited to the fund established by this section must be disbursed to the 2 
remaining commercial tracks and to agricultural fair licensees that conduct live racing 3 
based on days raced during extended  meets up to a maximum of 100 days raced during 4 
extended meets per year and until such time as a new commercial track begins operation.  5 
If a commercial track ceases operation, the commission may vary from the distribution 6 
schedule set forth in subsection 2 to facilitate racing at other licensed tracks in the State.   7 
The payment to a commercial track or agricultural fair is determined by dividing the 8 
amount in the fund by 150 and multiplying the result by the number of days raced by that 9 
commercial track or  agricultural fair  pursuant to subsections 2 and 5, with agricultural 10 
fair licenses conducting live racing during attended meets receiving race day credits as 11 
determined in subsection 5 in a similar manner as commercial race tracks receive race 12 
day credits .  An agricultural fair must receive its payment on no later than  May 30th 13 
before extended meets are held based on assigned dates for extended meets for that 14 
agricultural fair.  An adjustment must be made no later than the January 30th following 15 
the extend ed meets that results in payment to an agricultural fair based on days actually 16 
raced during extended meets by that agricultural fair.  Any amount remaining in the fund 17 
on January 30th after payments are made to commercial tracks and agricultural fairs mus t 18 
be transferred to the operating account of the commission under section 267 -A. 19 
For the purposes of this subsection, "region" is determined by measuring a distance of 50 20 
miles from the center of the racing track along the most commonly used roadway, as 21 
determined by the Department of Transportation, drawing a circle around the center of 22 
the racing track using that 50 -mile measurement and excluding those municipalities or 23 
unorganized territories that do not have boundaries contained entirely by that circle.  24 
Sec. 26.  8 MRSA §299, sub -§5 is enacted to read:  25 
5.  Race day credits.  For the purposes of this section, race day credits are awarded 26 
as follows:  27 
A.  One race day credit is earned for each day actually raced;  28 
B.  One additional race day credit is earned  for each day raced when no other 29 
association licensed under section 271 is scheduled to race; and  30 
C.  One additional race day credit is earned for each day raced during the months of 31 
March and December. A maximum of 12 race day credits may be awarded per 32 
commercial track for the month of March and a maximum of 12 race day credits may 33 
be awarded per commercial track for the month of December.  34
