This amendment removes section 1 of the bill which allowed for nursing facilites to increase the cap on the cost of a 
medical director from $10,000 to $22,000. Removing this section eliminates all appropriations and allocations from 
the bill. 
As amended, this bill would still require the Department of Health and Human Services to permit capital expenditures 
by residential care facilities (RCF) that are less than $500,000 without prior approval and to provide an extraordinary 
circumstance allowance in permitted reimbursement to RCF's. As outlined in the original fiscal note, the costs 
incurred by an RCF to comply with federal or state laws, regulations and rules shall be considered reasonable and 
necessary costs. These additional changes to the Residential Care Facilities will increase costs that will largely be 
necessitated by decisions of the RCFs that cannot be projected by the department. Since new construction, 
acquisitions, and renovations apply to room and board and not direct care, which cannot be reimbursed with federal 
funds per 42 CPR 440.182, it is also expected that these costs would be reimbursed entirely by the General Fund.
