This bill clarifies the rules allowing a licensed manufacturer to also hold a license for a retail establishment where 
liquor is consumed on the premises and also establishes that distilled spirits may be donated to charitable 
organizations by both in-state and out-of-state manufacturers. Any additional costs to the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations, as a result of these 
changes are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
