COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
R. of S. COMMITIEE AMENDMENT ·A "to H.P. 1048, L.D. 1524 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 9 and inserting the following: 
2 'Sec. 9. 29-A MRSA §1953, sub-§2, 1C, as enacted by PL 1993, c. 683, Pt. A,

8 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
9 section number to read consecutively. 
10 SUMMARY 
11 Under current law, the definition of "wrecker" specifically excludes a vehicle 
12 designed to carry or tow more than one vehicle on its own body. This amendment 
13 amends that definition to include a vehicle designed to carry or tow up to 2 vehicles on its 
14 own body. 
15 The amendment also strikes redundant language that seeks to clarify that the version 
16 of federal regulations incorporated by reference into the rules of the Department of Public 
17 Safety, Maine State Police is the most cun-ent version as filed with the Secretary of State. 
18 Current law already provides for this. 
19 The amendment strikes from the bill the provision that creates the Class C crime of 
20 operating, or permitting the operation of, a motor vehicle without proof of financial 
21 responsibility if death or serious bodily injury results from an accident involving that 
22 motor vehicle. 
23 The amendment makes a technical correction to a reference to a federal regulation. 
24 Current law specifies that a truck tractor need not be equipped with splash guards 
25 when it is not hauling a trailer or semitrailer. The amendment repeals that exception. 
26 The bill reallocates from the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22 to Title 29-A the 
27 statute that prohibits a person from smoking in a motor vehicle when a person who has 
28 not attained 16 years of age is present in that motor vehicle. The amendment provides 
29 that a penalty for a violation of this prohibition is a traffic infraction rather than a civil 
30 violation.
