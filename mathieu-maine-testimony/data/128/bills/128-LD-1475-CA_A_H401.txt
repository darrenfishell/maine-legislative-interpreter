The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $3,043,965 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and $4,058,620 in fiscal year 2018-19 to increase the payment rates to the 75th percentile of local 
market rates for payments the department makes on behalf of recipients of benefits under the child care subsidy 
program. Federal Block Grant Fund allocations are also included of $38,459,430 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 
$43,973,631 in fiscal year 2018-19 for multiple prngram changes in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
program. 
The provision in this bill that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide the Maine State 
Housing Authority (MSHA) with a fee to administer the voucher program for housing assistance is anticipated to be 
sufficient to cover the costs to MSHA and additional General Fund appropriations will not be required.
