SUMMARY  28 
This bill exempts from Maine income tax certain income from out -of-state pensions 29 
in order to avoid double taxation of that income.  The exemption is only for the amount of 30 
the contribution made by  the taxpayer divided by the life expectancy of the taxpayer and 31 
applies only if the income is included in federal adjusted gross income and not deducted 32 
under the general pension deduction.  33 
In order to qualify for the exemption, the contribution must have  been made using 34 
income on which income tax was paid and is available only if the state in which the 35 
taxpayer resided at the time of the contribution provides a similar exemption to a former 36 
resident of Maine.  37
