SUMMARY  12 
Current law provides a property tax exemption to a veteran of the Arme d Forces of 13 
the United States but only if the veteran served during a federally recognized war period 14 
and is at least 62 years of age or was disabled during active military service.  The amount 15 
of the exemption varies depending on when the veteran served a nd whether the veteran is 16 
a paraplegic.  This bill removes the requirement that the veteran must have served during 17 
a federally recognized war period, making the exemption available to all veterans of the 18 
Armed Forces of the United States who are 62 years of age or older or have qualifying 19 
disabilities.  This bill does not change the amounts of the exemption or the other 20 
qualifying conditions.  21
