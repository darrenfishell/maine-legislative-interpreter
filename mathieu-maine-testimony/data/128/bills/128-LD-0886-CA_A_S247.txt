SENATE 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 286, L.D. 886, Bill, "An Act To 
Require That Maine Welfare Benefits Be Used in Maine" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง3763, sub-ยง13 is enacted to read: 
13. Restriction on use of electronic benefits transfer system outside State. A 
recipient of benefits under this chapter may not access those benefits using the electronic 
benefits transfer system established in section 22 outside of this State, unless a recipient 
is: 
A. In New Hampshire; or 
B. A victim of domestic violence and leaving the victim's abuser. The department 
may require a recipient asserting the applicability of this paragraph to provide 
reasonable and verifiable evidence of the domestic violence pursuant to section 3785, 
subsection 13 .' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. It prohibits a recipient of 
benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program from 
using an electronic benefits transfer system card to access those benefits outside of Maine 
unless the recipient is in New Hampshire or fleeing a domestic violence situation.

Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium savings -Federal Block Grant Funds 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
The Department of Health and Human Services does not have the technology to stop out-of-state purchases at the 
point of sale. However, an individual who knowingly violates the program rules could be sanctioned under the 
Intentional Program Violation, Chapter VI: Administrative Procedures in 10-144 Department of Health and Human 
Services Chapter 331: Public Assistance Manual (TANF -Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) rules. These 
sanctions remove individuals from the program as follows: one year for first violation, 2 years for second violation 
and permanently for 3rd violation. Assuming individuals do violate the rules and purchase items using TANF funds 
outside of the state, excluding New Hampshire or fleeing a domestic violence situation, they could receive these 
sanctions and achieve savings in the TANF Federal Block Grant Funds. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt new rules are expected to be minor 
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
