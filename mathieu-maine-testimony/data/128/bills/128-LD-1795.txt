Page 1 - 128LR2816(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, laws were enacted by the 128th Legislature that inadvertently omitted a 
4 cross-reference to the Maine Rules  of Evidence in the law on service  of process on 
5 foreign entities that are providers of electronic  communication service and providers  of 
6 remote computing service; repealed the option of prosecuting possession of up to 2 1/2 
7 ounces of marijuana  by persons under 18 years of age as a civil violation; and neglected 
8 to amend  the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2013 to include  a 
9 registration obligation  for the new crime of gross sexual  assault  based  on lack of 
10 acquiescence; and  
11 Whereas, timely correction of these  errors  and omissions is necessary to the proper 
12 administration of the  criminal laws; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
15 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
16 therefore,
17 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
18 Sec. 1.  15 MRSA §56, sub-§2, ¶C, as enacted  by PL 2017, c. 144, §3, is 
19 amended to read:
20 C.  A foreign entity  provider shall verify the authenticity  of records  that it produces 
21 by providing an affidavit that complies with the requirements set forth in the Maine 
22 Rules of Evidence, Rule 902(11) if the foreign entity that is the provider  of services  is 
23 governed by the laws of another  state and that complies with the requirements  set 
24 forth in the Maine Rules of Evidence, Rule  902(12) if the foreign  entity  that is the 
25 provider of services is governed by the laws of a foreign country. Admissibility of 
26 these records in a court  in this State  is governed  by the Maine Rules of Evidence, 
27 Rule 803(6).
28 Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §2383, sub-§1-A, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 1, §20, is amended 
29 to read:
30 1-A.  Marijuana possession by a person  under 21 years of age.  Except for 
31 possession of marijuana for medical use pursuant to chapter 558-C, a person who is under  
32 21 years  of age may not possess marijuana.  A person  who is 18, 19 or 20 under  21 years 
33 of age who possesses a usable amount of marijuana commits  a civil violation for which a 
34 fine of not less than $350 and not more  than $600 must be adjudged for possession  of up 
35 to 1 1/4 ounces of marijuana and a fine of not less than $700 and not more than $1,000 
36 must be adjudged  for possession of over 1 1/4 ounces to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana, none 
37 of which may be suspended.  For the purposes  of this section, marijuana has the same 
38 meaning as  in Title 17-A, section 1101, subsection 1.
39 Sec. 3.  34-A  MRSA §11273, sub-§15, ¶A, as amended  by PL 2017, c. 65, §2, is 
40 further amended  to read:
Page 2 - 128LR2816(01)-11 A.  Title 17-A, chapter 11 including  the following:
2 (1)  Title  17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph  J, regardless of the age of 
3 the victim;
4 (1-A)  Title 17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph  F, regardless of the age of 
5 the victim if the  crime  is committed on or  after October 1, 2017;
6 (2)  Title 17-A, section  253, subsection 2, paragraph K, regardless of the age of 
7 the victim;
8 (3)  Title 17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph  L, regardless of the age of 
9 the victim;
10 (3-A)  Title 17-A, section 253, subsection 2, paragraph  M, regardless of the age

14 the victim;
15 (4-A) Title 17-A, section  255-A, subsection 1, paragraph  L, regardless of the age 
16 of the victim if the  crime is committed  on or after October 1, 2017;
17 (5)  Title 17-A, section  255-A, subsection 1, paragraph R-1, regardless of the age 
18 of the victim;
19 (6)  Title 17-A, section  255-A, subsection 1, paragraph R-2, regardless of the age 
20 of the victim; and
21 (7)  Title  17-A, section 258, subsection 1-A, if the victim had not attained 12 
22 years of  age;
23 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
24 legislation takes effect when  approved.
25 SUMMARY
26 This bill is emergency legislation.  The bill makes the following corrections to the 
27 criminal and related  laws and to the law on possession of more  than 2 1/2 ounces of 
28 marijuana.
29 1.  Public Law 2017, chapter 144, section 3 failed  to distinguish, in the laws on 
30 service of process on providers of electronic communication service and providers  of 
31 remote computing service, between foreign entities that are governed by laws of states 
32 other than Maine and those that are governed by laws of foreign countries.   The bill 
33 distinguishes these 2 types of foreign entities and provides a cross-reference to the Maine 
34 Rules of  Evidence  for each type of foreign entity.
35 2.  Public Law 2017, chapter  1, section 20 designated possession  of up to 2 1/2 
36 ounces of marijuana  by a person under 18 years  of age a violation of the Maine  Juvenile 
37 Code, which was one of 2 options for prosecution under prior  law.  Chapter 1 repealed  
38 the option of prosecution of possession as a civil violation.  The bill retains the 
Page 3 - 128LR2816(01)-11 designation of possession as a juvenile crime  and restores the designation of possession 
2 as a civil violation.  Neither  the juvenile crime nor the civil violation applies to 
3 possession of up to 2 1/2 ounces by a person under  21 years of age who is a qualified  
4 patient for the purposes of the Medical Use of Marijuana Act.
5 3.  Public  Law 2017, chapter 300 created a new version of the crime of gross  sexual 
6 assault, specifically,  engaging in a sexual act with another  person  when  that other person 
7 has not expressly or impliedly  acquiesced  to the sexual act.  The law neglected to create  a 
8 corresponding registration provision for the newly defined variant of gross sexual  assault.   
9 The bill designates gross  sexual  assault  based on lack of acquiescence to the sexual act as 
10 a Tier II offense  under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2013. The 
11 registration obligation will apply to conduct committed on or after the effective date of 
12 this Act.
