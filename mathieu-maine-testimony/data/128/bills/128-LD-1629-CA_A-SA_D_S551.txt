7 SECOND SPECIAL SESSION 
8 SENATE AMENDMENT "Q" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 
9 1124, L.D. 1629, Bill, "An Act To Protect the Elderly from Tax Lien Foreclosures" 
10 Amend the amendment by striking out all of sections 1 to 4 and inserting the 
11 following: 
12 1Sec. 1. 36 MRSA §683, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2009, c. 213, Pt. YYY, §1 
13 and affected by c. 652, Pt. A, §63, is further amended to read: 
14 1. Exemption amount. Except for assessments for special benefits, the just value of 
15 $10,000 of the homestead of a permanent resident of this State who has owned a 
16 homestead in this State for the preceding 12 months is exempt from taxation. 
17 Notwithstanding this subsection, a permanent resident of this State who loses ownership 
18 of a homestead in this State due to a tax lien foreclosure and subsequently regains 
19 ownership of the homestead from the municipality that foreclosed on the tax lien is 
20 deemed to have continuously owned the homestead and may not be determined ineligible 
21 for the exemption provided in this section due to the ownership of the homestead by the 
22 municipality. In determining the local assessed value of the exemption, the assessor shall 
23 multiply the amount of the exemption by the ratio of current just value upon which the 
24 assessment is based as furnished in the assessor1s annual return pursuant to section 383. 
25 If the title to the homestead is held by the applicant jointly or in common with others, the 
26 exemption may not exceed $10,000 of the just value of the homestead, but may be 
27 apportioned among the owners who reside on the property to the extent of their respective 
28 interests. A municipality responsible for administering the homestead exemption has no 
29 obligation to create separate accounts for each partial interest in a homestead owned 
30 jointly or in common. 
31 Sec. 2. 36 MRSA §942, as amended by PL 2009, c. 489, §§2 and 3, is further 
32 amended by inserting after the 2nd paragraph a new paragraph to read: 
33 For property that constitutes a homestead for which a property tax exemption is 
34 claimed under subchapter 4-B, the tax collector shall include with the written notice 
35 authorized under this section written notice to the person named on the tax lien mortgage 
3 6 that that person may be eligible to file an application for tax abatement under section 841, 
37 subsection 2, indicating that the municipality, upon request, will assist the person in 
3 8 requesting an abatement and provide information regarding the procedures for making

or mutual funds, life insurance policies, stocks and bonds, lump-sum payments 
and inheritances and funds from a home equity conversion mortgage that are in

to read: 
§1281. Payment of taxes; delinquent taxes; publication; certificate filed in registry 
Taxes on real estate mentioned in section 1602, including supplementary taxes 
assessed under section 1331, are delinquent on the 15th day of January next following the

send by mail to the last known address of each owner of such real estate upon which 
taxes remain unpaid a notice in writing, containing a description of the real estate 
assessed and the amount of unpaid taxes and interest, and alleging that a lien is claimed 
on that real estate for payment of those taxes, interests and costs, with a demand that 
payment be made by the next February 21st. For property that constitutes a homestead 
for which a property tax exemption is claimed under chapter 105, subchapter 4-B, the 
State Tax Assessor shall include in the written notice written notice to the owner named 
on the tax lien mortgage that that owner may be eligible to file an application for tax

this section on that real estate to be advertised in the state paper and in a newspaper, if 
any, of general circulation in the county in which the real estate lies. Such a statement or 
advertisement is sufficient legal notice of delinquent taxes. If those taxes and interest to 
date of payment and costs are not paid by February 21st, the State Tax Assessor shall 
record by March 15th, in the registry of deeds of the county or registry district where the 
real estate lies, a certificate signed by the assessor, setting forth the name or names of the 
owners according to the last state valuation, or the valuation established in accordance

12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment amends Committee Amendment "A" to: 
14 1. Change the timing of the notice required in Committee Amendment 11A11 regarding 
15 a property owner's right to apply for an abatement and the availability of assistance so 
16 that the notice need not be issued separately and instead must be included with other 
17 notice to that property owner; 
18 2. Specify that the income conditions established in Committee Amendment 11A11 
19 apply after medical expenses have been deducted; 
20 3. Specify that the procedure established for the sale by municipalities of homesteads 
21 acquired through tax lien foreclosure applies to properties that had previously received a 
22 homestead exemption, rather than to properties that had merely been eligible for the 
23 exemption; 
24 4. Require that municipal notice to a former owner of the right to require the sale 
25 procedure be sent by first-class mail to the last known address of the former owner; 
26 5. Require documentation from the former owner verifying income and assets; 
27 6. Designate as confidential applications for the procedure for the municipal sale of

30 such applications be held in executive session; 
31 7. Specify that the real estate broker with whom the property is listed may not hold 
32 an elected or appointed office in the relevant municipality and may not be employed by 
33 that municipality; 
34 8. Require the municipality to attempt to contract with at least 3 such real estate 
3 5 brokers for the sale of the property before retaining, selling or disposing of the property 
36 through the tax lien foreclosure process; 
37 9. Specifically include reasonable attorney's fees as part of the amount retained by 
3 8 the municipality after sale of the property; and

This amendment removes the requirement for a notice to the taxpayer of potential eligibility to file for tax abatement. 
As the mandate for a separate notice is removed, the costs anticipated from increased abatement activity originating 
from the notification would not be considered mandated costs and the General Fund appropriation is reduced by 
$823,005 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. The mandated requirements to engage a real estate broker, sell the 
property at fair market value or the price anticipated by the broker and remit excess proceeds to the taxpayer remain in 
the bill. As amended, the bill still contains an ongoing General Fund appropriation of $2,250 beginning in fiscal year 
2018-19 to cover these costs. This amount represents 90% of the estimated net cost to municipalities not recovered 
through the sale of the property.
