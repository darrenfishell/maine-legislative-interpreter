Forestry Bureau. The growth rate surveys must be reduced by the percentage discount 38 
facto r prescribed by section 576 -B to reflect the growth that can be extracted on a 39 
sustained basis. The rates when determined remain in effect without change for each 40

1.  Organized areas.   The municipal assessors or chief assessor of a primary 9 
assessing area shall adjust the State Tax Assessor's 100% valuation per acre for each 10 
forest type of their county by whatever ratio, or percentage of current just value, is 11 
applied to other property within the municipality to obtain the assessed values.  F orest 12 
land in the organized areas, subject to taxation under this subchapter, must be taxed at the 13 
property tax rate applicable to other property in the municipality.  14 
The State Tax Assessor shall determine annually the amount of acreage in each 15 
municipalit y that is classified and taxed in accordance with this subchapter.  Each 16 
municipality is entitled to annual payments distributed in accordance with this section 17 
from money appropriated by the Legislature if it submits an annual return in accordance 18 
with se ction 383 and if it achieves the minimum assessment ratio established in section 19 
327.  The State Tax Assessor shall pay any municipal claim found to be in satisfactory 20 
form by August 1st  October 15th  of the year following the submission of the annual 21 
retur n.  The municipal reimbursement appropriation is calculated on the basis of 90% of 22 
the per acre tax revenue lost as a result of this subchapter.  For property tax years based 23 
on the status of property on April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2009, municipal reimburse ment 24

distributed on a pro rata basis by the State Tax Assessor for all timely filed claims.  For 26 
purposes of this section, "classified forest lands" means forest lands classified pursuant to 27 
this subchapter as well as all areas identified as forested land within farmland parcels that 28

been assessed, but for this subchapter, on the classified forest lands if they were assessed 31 
according to the undeveloped acreage valuations used in the state valuation then in effect, 32 
or according to the current local valuation on undeveloped acreage, whichever is less, 33 
minus the tax that was actually assessed on the same lands in accordance with this 34 
subchapter, and adjusted for the aggregate municipal savings in required educational 35 
costs attributable to reduced state  valuation.  A municipality that fails to achieve the 36 
minimum assessment ratio established in section 327 loses 10% of the reimbursement 37 
provided by this section for each one percentage point the minimum assessment ratio falls 38 
below the ratio established i n section 327.  39 
The State Tax Assessor shall adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of this 40 
section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules for the 41 
purposes of Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 42 
C.  The State Ta x Assessor shall distribute reimbursement under this section to each 43 
municipality in proportion to the product of the reduced tree growth valuation of the 44

SUMMARY  25 
This bill makes technical changes to correct and update cro ss-references, correct 26 
clerical errors, resolve statutory numbering conflicts, improve syntax and repeal 27 
unnecessary and expired language.  In addition, this bill does the following.  28 
1.  It requires a person filing a statement of appeal with the Board of T ax Appeals or 29 
a petition for review with the Superior Court to serve the statement or petition by certified 30 
mail, return receipt requested, upon the Attorney General and the Department of 31 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services.  32 
2.  It restricts the disclosure and use of confidential information provided by the 33 
bureau to persons, agencies and organizations for the purposes specified in the 34 
exemptions to Maine’s confidentiality statute.  35 
3.  It removes the requirement that the bureau  publish a list of certified assessors that 36 
the bureau maintains. Instead, the bureau is required to provide the list to municipalities 37 
upon request.  38 
4.  It changes the due date for the annual distribution to municipalities for revenue 39 
lost under the Maine  Tree Growth Tax Law from August 1st to October 15th.  40 
 
 Page 26 - 128LR0722(01) -1 
 5.  It clarifies that certain property of institutions and organizations that is exempt 1 
from property taxes under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 652 is not exempt 2 
under the business equip ment tax exemption program.  3 
6.  It clarifies that the report due under the business equipment tax exemption 4 
program is due on April 1st, which, under current law, is automatically extended to May 5 
1st if the report is not received by April 1st. It also requ ires a request for further extension 6 
to be submitted to the assessor of the taxing jurisdiction before the commitment of taxes.  7 
7.  It makes minor changes to the language requiring the municipal tax collector to 8 
certify the delinquency between July 1st and  July 15th in the same year the taxpayer 9 
applies for the reimbursement.  10 
8.  It clarifies that the definition of "prescription" for purposes of the exemption from 11 
the sales and use tax for prosthetic or orthotic devices.  12 
9.  It describes more accurately the  evidence of overpayment of sales tax that must be 13 
presented by a purchaser or retailer when requesting a refund of an overpayment of sales 14 
tax.  This clarification is consistent with long -standing administrative practice.  15 
10.  It reallocates the statutory  provisions governing the phase -out of Maine standard 16 
and itemized deductions to those sections of law governing the calculation of Maine 17 
standard and itemized deductions.  18
