SUMMARY  19 
The Maine Revised Statutes, Title 11, section 3 -1118, subsection (1) in Article 3 -A of 20 
the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs negotiable instruments, provides for a 6 - 21 
year statute o f limitations for enforcement of negotiable instruments.  In 2004, the Maine 22 
Supreme Judicial Court sitting as the Law Court held in Fleet National Bank v. Liberty , 23 
2004 ME 36, 845 A.2d 1183, that Title 11, section 3 -1118, subsection (1) did not repeal 24 
the 20-year statute of limitations for some types of instruments in Title 14, section 751, 25 
either expressly or by implication.  This bill provides that the 6 -year statute of limitations 26 
in Title 11, section 3 -1118, subsection (1) applies to all negotiable ins truments, 27 
notwithstanding the 20 -year statute of limitations for some types of instruments in Title 28 
14, section 751.  29 
This bill also provides that the 6 -year statute of limitations does not apply to certain 30 
negotiable instruments until 90 days after the leg islation takes effect.  It requires the 31 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Financial Institutions 32 
and Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection to give written notice to all financial 33 
institutions, mortgage servicers and debt collect ors regulated by or registered with them 34 
and to other entities and agencies that have interests in loans that may be affected by this 35 
legislation.  36
