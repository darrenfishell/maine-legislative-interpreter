 SUMMARY  1 
This bill repeals the cur rent law governing amendment of the birth certificate of an 2 
adult and creates a process for amending an adult's birth certificate when genetic testing 3 
identifies a parent who was not known or listed at the time of the adult's birth and the 4 
genetic parent t o be named on the amended birth certificate either consents in writing to 5 
the amendment or is deceased.  The bill provides that amendment of a birth certificate 6 
without the consent of the genetic parent to be named on the amended birth certificate 7 
does not  affect the rights of inheritance or descent.  8
