SUBCHAPTER 2 -A 4 
NURSE LICENSURE COMP ACT  5 
§2171.  Short title; findings and declaration of purpose -- Article 1  6 
1.  Short title.  This chapter may be known and cited as "the Nurse Licensure 7 
Compact," or "the compact."  8 
2.  Legislative intent.  This compact is the Maine enactment of the Nurse Licensure 9 
Compact as revised by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.  The form, 10 
forma t and text of the compact have been changed minimally so as to conform to Maine 11 
statutory conventions.  The changes are technical in nature, and it is the intent of the 12 
Legislature that this Act be interpreted as substantively the same as the Nurse Licensu re 13 
Compact that is enacted by other party states.  14 
3.  Findings.  The party states find that:  15 
A.  The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with 16 
and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licens ure laws;  17 
B.  Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing 18 
may result in injury or harm to the public;  19 
C.  The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication 20 
technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater 21 
coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and 22 
regulation;  23 
D.  New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state 24 
nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;  25 
E.  The system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is 26 
cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and  27 
F.  Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public 28 
safety and public health benefits.  29 
4.  Purpose.  The general purposes of this compact are to:  30 
A.  Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;  31 
B.  Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse 32 
licensure and regulation;  33 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1234(01) -1 
 C.  Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse 1 
regulation, investigation and adverse actions;  2 
D.  Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each 3 
jurisdiction;  4 
E.  Invest all party states with the  authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting 5 
all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is 6 
rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;  7 
F.  Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and  8 
G.  Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure 9 
requirements.  10

has the authority to:  13 
A.  Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice  14 
within that party state.  15 
(1)  Only the home state has the power to take adverse action against a nurse's 16 
license issued by the home state.  17 
(2)  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall 18 
give the same priority and effect t o a report of conduct received from a remote 19 
state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, 20 
the home state licensing board shall apply its own state laws to determine 21 
appropriate action;  22 
B.  Issue cease and desist order s or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to 23 
practice within that party state;  24 
C.  Complete any pending investigation of a nurse who changes primary state of 25 
residence during the course of such investigation.  The licensing board also has the 26 
autho rity to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of an 27 
investigation to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  28 
The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly 29

and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence.  A subpoena issued 32 
by a licensing board in a party st ate for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or 33 
the production of evidence from another party state may be enforced in the latter state 34 
by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of 35 
that court applicable to subpoen as issued in proceedings pending before it.  The 36 
issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees 37 
required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence is 38 
located;  39 
E.  Obtain and submit, for e ach nurse licensure applicant, fingerprints or other 40

investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken 5 
against that nurse; and  6 
G.  Take adverse  action based on the factual findings of the remote state, as long as 7 
the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.  8 
2.  Adverse action.  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's 9 
multistate license, the  nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party 10 
states is deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate 11 
license.  A home state disciplinary order that imposes adverse action against a nurse's 12 
multistate lic ense must include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege 13 
is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.  14 
3.  Alternative program.  Nothing in this compact overrides a decision by a 15 
licensing board of a party state that participation in an alternative program may be used in 16 
lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate 17 
licensure privilege under the multistate license of a nurse for the duration of the nurse's 18 
participation in an alternative program.  19

Article 6  21 
1.  Participation.  A party state shall participate in the coordinated licensure 22 
information system for all licensed registered nurses and lic ensed practical or vocational 23 
nurses.  The coordinated licensure information system includes information on the 24 
licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in 25 
the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement  efforts.  26 
2.  Procedures.  The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the 27 
coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper 28 
procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this 29 
compact.  30 
3.  Reports.  A licensing board shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure 31 
information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, 32 
denials of applications, including the reasons for such denials, and nurse pa rticipation in 33 
alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such 34 
participation is considered nonpublic or confidential under state law.  35

participatio n in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs may be transmitted 37 
through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.  38
