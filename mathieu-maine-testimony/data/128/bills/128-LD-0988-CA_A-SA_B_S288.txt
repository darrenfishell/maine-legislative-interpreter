FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT" t'J "to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 327, 
L.D. 988, Bill, "An Act Regarding Possession of a Firearm on School Property" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 by striking out all of paragraph D (page 1, lines 
14 to 19 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
'D. The prohibition on the possession of a firearm does not apply to a person who 
possesses a firearm in a motor vehicle as long as the following conditions are met: 
(1) The person is dropping off or picking up a student and remains inside the 
motor vehicle; and 
(2) The firearm is not loaded and is concealed either in the motor vehicle or on 
the person's person.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the requirement in Committee Amendment "A" that a 
firearm in a motor vehicle of a person dropping off or picking up a student on school 
property needs to be in a locked container or locked firearms rack. Instead, this 
amendment requires the firearm to be concealed either in the motor vehicle or on the 
person's person.
