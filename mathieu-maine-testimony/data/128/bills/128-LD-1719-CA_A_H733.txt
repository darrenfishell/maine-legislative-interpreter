22 This amendment, which is the majority rep01t of the committee, replaces the bill. 
23 Like the bill, the amendment facilitates the development and administration of a regulated 
24 marketplace in the State for adult use marijuana and the regulation of the personal use of 
25 marijuana and the home cultivation of marijuana for personal adult use pursuant to the 
26 Marijuana Legalization Act, as approved by the voters at referendum in November 2016; 
27 however, the amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
28 PART A 
29 
30 Like Patt A in the bill, Part A in the amendment repeals the Marijuana Legalization 
31 Act, as codified in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 7, chapter 417, and recodifies it as 
32 the Marijuana Legalization Act, referred to in this summary as "the Act," in a new Title 
33 28-B, Adult Use Marijuana, but makes the following changes. 
34 1. It designates the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, referred to 
35 in this summary as "the department," as the sole regulatory agency in the implementation, 
36 administration and enforcement of the Act, but requires the depaitment to consult with 
37 the Depaitment of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry prior to the adoption of rules

4 marijuana social clubs.

6 tax revenue with municipalities. 
7 4. It changes the definition of the tenn "plant canopy" to include in the calculation of 
8 plant canopy only those areas in which mature marijuana plants are to be cultivated. The 
9 amendment reduces the maximum cultivation facility license tier sizes under the bill by 
10 approximately 1/3 to account for this changed definition but does not change the 
11 application fees or license fees amount for cultivation facility licenses as provided in the 
12 bill. 
13 5. It defines the term "resident" for the purposes of 1 icensure as a natural person who 
14 is domiciled in Maine, maintains a permanent place of abode in Maine and spends in the 
15 aggregate more than 183 days of the taxable year in Maine and has filed a resident 
16 individual income tax return pursuant to Title 3 6, Patt 8 in each of the 3 years prior to the 
17 year in which the person files an application for licensure under the Act. The provision 
18 of this definition requiring the filing of resident individual income tax returns for the 3 
19 years prior to applying for a license is repealed June 1, 2021. It removes the explicit 2-
20 year residency requirement. 
21 6. It retains the provisions authorizing the sharing of facilities for the cultivation and 
22 manufacturing of adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana products and marijuana 
23 and marijuana products for medical use by a licensee that is also a registered primary 
24 caregiver or registered dispensary. The amendment, however, prohibits a marijuana store 
25 licensee that is also a registered primary caregiver or registered dispensary from selling 
26 adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana products to consumers and marijuana and 
27 marijuana products for medical use to qualifying patients from the same facility or 
28 building. 
29 7. It provides technical clarifications to the municipal-level licensing and approval 
30 process and also includes provisions applicable to the local authorization of marijuana 
31 establishments to be located in towns, plantations or townships in the unorganized and 
32 deorganized areas of the State. 
33 8. It explicitly prohibits the entry into any marijuana establishment by a person under 
34 21 years of age. 
35 9. It changes the membership provisions and duties of the Marijuana Advisory 
36 Commission as proposed in the bill. 
37 10. It increases the excise tax rate on marijuana flower and mature marijuana plants 
38 from $130 per pound to $335 per pound and the excise tax rate on marijuana trim from

40 plants, seedlings and marijuana seeds remain as proposed in the bill. 
41 11. It changes the provisions proposed in the bill relating to the personal adult use of 
42 marijuana and marijuana products and the home cultivation of marijuana for personal 
43 adult use by reducing the number of mature marijuana plants that may be possessed,

4 parcel or tract of land within the municipality, so long as that ordinance or regulation 
5 allows for the cultivation of 3 mature marijuana plants, 12 immature marijuana plants and 
6 an unlimited number of seedlings by each person 21 years of age or older who is 
7 domiciled on a parcel or tract of land. The amendment includes language providing that 
8 this reduction in the number of authorized mature marijuana plants from 6 plants to 3 
9 plants does not take effect until 6 months after the effective date of the legislation. 
10 12. It clarifies advertising and marketing standards and standards relating to signs 
11 used by a licensee to ensure a prohibition on advertising, marketing and signs that have a 
12 high likelihood of reaching persons under 21 years of age or that are specifically designed 
13 to appeal particularly to persons under 21 years of age. The amendment also requires the 
14 department, after consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services, Maine 
15 Center for Disease Control and Prevention, to develop rules on required health and safety 
16 warning labels. It also authorizes the use of the te11ns "organic, 11 "organically cultivated" 
17 or "organically grown" on the label or packaging of adult use marijuana and adult use 
18 marijuana products consistent with rules on the use of such terms to be adopted by the

33 Medical Use of Marijuana Act are not affected by the provisions of the Act. 
34 16. It directs the depattment to ensure that, when necessary and practicable, the 
35 regulation of the labeling and packaging of adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana 
3 6 products under the Act is consistent with the regulation of the labeling and packaging of 
37 marijuana and marijuana products for medical use under the Maine Medical Use of 
3 8 Marijuana Act. 
3 9 17. It provides for a limited period in which a cultivation facility licensee that is also

The bill designates the Department of Administrative and Financial Services (DAFS) as the sole regulatory agency in 
the implementation, administration and enforcement of the Marijuana Legalization Act. The role of the Department of 
Agricultme, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) is limited to consulting activites related to adoption of ce1iain rules. 
The bill establishes the following excise taxes: 
1) Excise tax on marijuana flower and mature marijuana plants -$335 per pmmd

4) Excise tax on marijuana seeds -$0.30 per marijuana seed 
LR2805(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 3 
Excise taxes, 12 % of excise taxes, and 12 % of existing sales tax -The~~i{~ ~?! ~se excise texes is to be 
credited to the General Fund, except that 12% of this revenue will be credited to the Adult Use Marijuana Public 
Health and Safety Fund (PHSF) within DAFS to be used for public health and safety awareness and education 
programs and for enhanced law enforcement training. The bill also requires that 12% of the existing sales tax on 
marijuana and marijuana products also go to the PHSF. The net impact on General Fund revenue will be an increase 
of $1,441,584 in fiscal year 2018-19, rising to more than $5,000,000 in subsequent years. The PHSF will receive 
$358,416 in fiscal year 2018-19, rising to more than $1,800,000 in subsequent years. 
License fee revenue -The bill creates manufacturing, retail store, testing and tiered cultivation licenses and sets the 
fee structure that DAFS may charge for each license. License fees are estimated to generate Other Special Revenue 
Funds revenue of $855,460 in fiscal year 2018-19 and more than $1,200,000 in subsequent years. 
Balance transfer -The bill creates the Adult Use Marijuana Regulato1y Coordination Fund and transfers the balance 
of the Retail Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund, currently $1,224,246, into it. 
Medical Marijuana revenue -This bill may lead to a reduction in the number of Maine Medical Marijuana Program 
registrations, as some registrants may decide to participate only in the non-medical marijuana industry. If this occurs it 
would reduce revenue from registration fees that is now credited to the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Fund to 
support that program. Any such reduction is expected to be minor. 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services -The bill includes General Fund appropriations to DAFS of 
$3,173,339 in fiscal year 2018-19. Ofthis amount, $2,028,806 is for 32 ongoing pennanent positions, $550,000 is a 
one-time appropriation to design and/or acquire tracking system and licensing system software and $594,533 is for

the PHSF, $828,017 including 3 positions for the Adult Use Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund and $1,085,931 
for the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund that includes 6.25 positions transferred from DHHS. 
Department of Health and Human Services -The bill transitions the administration and enforcement of the Maine 
Medical Use of Marijuana Act from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to DAFS. The bill 
includes net deallocations to DHHS of $1,056,295 beginning in fiscal 2018-19 for the transfer from the Medical Use 
of Marijuana Fund within the Department of Health and Human Services to the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund 
within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. $140, 751 is appropriated to the Maternal and Child 
Health Block Grant Match program in DHHS to restore 1.2 Public Service Coordinator II positions and $29,636 is 
allocated to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to restore 0.5 Office Assistant II positions that are 
. moving with the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund as it moves to DAFS. 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry -Allocations of $91,032 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 
$92,301 in fiscal year 2018-19 for the Marijuana Regulation and Licensing Fund within ACF are removed. 
Department of Public Safety -The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $43,701 and a Highway Fund 
allocation of $23 ,962 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Public Safety for one Identification Specialist II 
position and related costs to process criminal history background checks for marijuana establishment operators. Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Department of Public Safety will be increased by the amount charged for each 
background check. The amount of this increased revenue has not been estimated at this time. 
Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services -The bill includes an ongoing General Fund deappropriation of 
$7 5, 000 in 2018-19 to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to reflect fewer cases of assigned counsel 
related to marijuana offenses.

Legislature -This bill provides an o:1going appropriation of $2,250 in 2018-19 to the Legislature for the costs of 
legislators serving on the Marijuana Advismy Conunission. 
Labor -Additional costs to the Department of Labor to serve on the Marijuana Advismy Commission can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
D HHS -If marijuana use increases because oflegalization, the number of child welfare cases repo1ted to the 
Depa1tment of Health and Human Services could rise. Any increase in the number of investigations is not expected to 
increase costs to the department significantly.
