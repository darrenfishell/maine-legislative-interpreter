128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" /l,, to H.P. 1221, L.D. 1767, "Resolve, Regarding 
Legislative Review of Portions of Chapter 11.14: Atlantic Sea Scallop Limited Entry 
Program, a Major Substantive Rule of the Department of Marine Resources'' 
Amend the resolve by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. Adoption. Resolved: That final adoption of portions of Chapter 11.14: 
Atlantic Sea Scallop Limited Entry Program, a provisionally adopted major substantive 
rule of the Department of Marine Resources that has been submitted to the Legislature for 
review pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A, is 
authorized only if the following change is made: 
1. The rule is amended in section 14, subsection 1, paragraph D to remove 
subparagraphs (2) and (3) and instead to provide a method for increasing the number of 
draws an applicant receives based on the applicant's unsuccessful attempts in the lottery 
in consecutive years immediately preceding the lottery in which the applicant has 
submitted a lottery application.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment authorizes final adoption of portions of Chapter 11.14: Atlantic Sea 
Scallop Limited Entry Program, a provisionally adopted major substantive rule of the 
Department of Marine Resources, only if the rule is amended to remove the provisions 
providing additional draws in the scallop limited entry program lotteries for previous 
work in the scallop industry and for previously holding a scallop fishing license. Instead, 
the amendment directs the department to amend the rule to recognize an applicant's prior 
unsuccessful attempts in the lotteries.

This bill would authorize the final adoption of Department of Marine Resources (DMR) rules related to the Atlantic 
Sea Scallop Limited Entry Program. Under the cu1Tent rules, only individuals who held a license in the prior calendar 
year are eligible for a license renewal and no new individuals are allowed to be licensed. This relates to both 
commercial scallop drag licenses and commercial scallop diver licenses. The proposed rule changes would establish a 
lottery system to allow new individuals to enter the fishe1y. For c01mnercial scallop drag licenses 2 license entries will 
be allowed for every 3 license exits. For commercial scallop diver licenses one license ent1y will be allowed for eve1y 
one license exit. This will result in minor General Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds revenue increases. Any 
additional costs to DMR as a result of the final rule adoption are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
