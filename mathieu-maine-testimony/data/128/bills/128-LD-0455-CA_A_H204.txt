FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMEND:MENT "/J "to H.P. 322, L.D. 455, Bill, "An Act Relating

Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following:

Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1. 
Amend the bill in section 2 in subsection 28 in the 4th and 5th lines from the end 
(page 1, lines 27 and 28 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "the provision of tobacco 
cessation counseling services and the furnishing of' and inserting the following: 'the 
ordering and dispensing of over-the-counter' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 3. 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, like the bill, amends the definition of "practice of pharmacy." The 
bill changes the definition to include counseling related to tobacco cessation products. 
The amendment strikes that change and instead includes the ordering and dispensing of 
over-the-counter nicotine replacement products as part of the definition. It removes from 
the bill the provisions regarding reimbursement and rulemaking.
