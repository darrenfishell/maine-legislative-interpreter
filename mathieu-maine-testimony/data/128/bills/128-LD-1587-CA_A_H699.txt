Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation requires the University of Maine System to conduct a study to examine the financial solvency and 
costs of a paid family leave program in the State and allows the System to apply for and accept funds from any source, 
including the State and other public or private grant or contract funding sources, in order to carry out the study. 
Because this bill provides no funding, but requires the System to conduct the study only if resources are available, 
there will be no net fiscal impact to the State or the University of Maine System. The System estimates the cost of the 
study to be approximately $130,000.
