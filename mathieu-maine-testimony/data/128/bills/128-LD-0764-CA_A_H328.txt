FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 544, L.D. 764, Bill, "An Act To 
Prohibit the Exclusion of a Patient from Eligibility for an Organ Transplant Based on 
Medical Marijuana Use" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summaty and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง2423-E, sub-ยง10 is enacted to read: 
10. Receiving an anatomical gift. A transplant evaluator may not determine a 
qualifying patient to be unsuitable to receive an anatomical gift solely because the 
qualifying patient uses medical marijuana. In reviewing a qualifying patient's suitability 
for receiving an anatomical gift, a transplant evaluator shall treat the qualifying patient's 
medical use of marijuana as the equivalent of the authorized use of any other medications 
used at the direction of a medical provider. A transplant evaluator may determine a 
qualifying patient to be unsuitable to receive an anatomical gift if the qualifying patient 
does not limit the qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana to the use of forms of 
prepared marijuana that are not smoked or vaporized, including, but not limited to, edible 
marijuana and tinctures and salves of marijuana. A transplant evaluator may require 
medical marijuana used by a qualifying patient to be tested for fungal contamination by a 
marijuana testing facility. For purposes of this subsection, "transplant evaluator" means a 
person responsible for determining another person's suitability for receiving an 
anatomical gift. For the purposes of this subsection, "anatomical gift" has the same 
meaning as in section 2942, subsection 2.'

evaluator from determining a qualifying patient to be unsuitable to receive an anatomical
