therefore,  15 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  16 
PART A  17 
Sec. A -1.  15 MRSA §393, sub -§1-B, as amended by PL 2015, c. 470, §3, is 18 
further amended to read:  19 
1-B.  Prohibition for domestic violence offenses.  A person may not own, possess 20 
or have under that person's control a firearm if that person:  21 
A.  Has been convicted of committing or found not criminally responsible by reason 22 
of insanity of committing:  23 
(1) A Cl ass D crime in this State in violation of Title 17 -A, section 207 -A, 24 
209-A, 210 -B, 210 -C or 211 -A; or  25 
(2) A crime under the laws of the United States or any other state that in 26 
accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction is elementally substantially simi lar 27 
to a crime in subparagraph (1).  28

B.  Has been adjudicated in this State or under the laws of the United States or any 30 
other state to have engaged in conduct as a juvenile that, if committed by an adult,  31 
would have been a disqualifying conviction under this subsection.  Violation of this 32 
paragraph is a Class C crime.  33 
Except as provided in subsection 1 -A, the prohibition created by this subsection for a 34 
conviction or adjudication of an offense listed in pa ragraph A or B expires 5 years from 35

disposition period.  If, at the conclus ion of the deferred disposition period, the court 3 
grants the State's motion to allow a person to withdraw the plea and the State dismisses 4 
the pending charging instrument  charge that gave rise to the prohibition  with prejudice, 5 
the 5 -year period terminates . 6 
For the purposes of this subsection, a person is deemed to have been convicted or 7

finding of guilty, or of the equivalent in a juvenile case, by a court of competent 9 
jurisdiction.  10

SUMMARY  34 
This bill makes changes to the laws recommended by the Criminal Law Advisory 35 
Commission.  36 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR0540(01) -1 
 Part A does the following:  1 
1.  Amends the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 393, subsection 1 -B by 2 
replacing the words "pending charging instrument" with the words "the charge that gave 3 
rise to the prohibition" to eliminate a potential ambiguity; and  4 
2.  Enacts as Title 15, section 1094 -C a provision that makes it a Class C crime for a 5 
person arrested for a n alleged murder and who is detained because a Harnish bail 6 
proceeding has not yet taken place, the proceeding has been waived in open court by the 7 
person, or the proceeding has taken place and the person's conditional right to bail has 8 
been extinguished a nd bail has been denied by the court and who has been properly 9 
notified not to make direct or indirect contact with any specifically identified family or 10 
household member of the alleged victim of the murder for which the person is being 11 
detained to intenti onally or knowingly make direct or indirect contact with any 12 
specifically identified family or household member of the alleged victim.  13 
Part B clarifies provisions of the Criminal History Record Information Act as they 14 
apply to granted petitions for full an d free pardons.  15 
Part C does the following:  16 
1.  Rearranges into 2 subsections the content of Title 17 -A, section 33.  Subsection 1 17 
contains the content of the current section 33, except that it deletes the words "unless the 18 
concurrent cause was clearly suff icient to produce the result and the conduct of the 19 
defendant was clearly insufficient."  Subsection 2 contains a simplified test to be applied 20 
in the event concurrent causation is generated as an issue.  It provides that, when a 21 
defendant's conduct may ha ve operated concurrently with another cause, in addition to 22 
satisfying the "but for" test the defendant's conduct must have been sufficient by itself to 23 
produce the result; and  24 
2.  Amends Title 17 -A, section 505, subsection 2 by adding to the definition of  25 
"public way" the words "a way upon which the public has access as invitees or licensees."  26 
Part D allows the use of prior convictions for aggravated assault, elevated aggravated 27 
assault and elevated aggravated assault on a pregnant person, and like crimes in other 28 
jurisdictions, to be used to elevate the class of subsequent domestic violence crimes from 29 
Class D to Class C.  The prior conviction may be used to enhance the current charge only 30 
if the State or other jurisdiction proved, in the prior case, that the defendant and victim 31 
were family or household members.  32 
Part E does the following:  33 
1.  Amends Title 17 -A, section 1101 by enacting definitions of "cocaine" and 34 
"heroin."  The definition of "cocaine" mirrors that currently found in Title 17 -A, section 35 
1102, subsection 1, paragraph F.  The definition of "heroin" as "any compound, mixture 36 
or preparation containing heroin (diacetylmorphine) in any quantity" is in response to 37 
State v. Pinkham, Sr., 2016 ME 59, 137 A. 3d 203; and  38 
2.  Repeals the definition of  "cocaine" in Title 17 -A, section 1102, subsection 1, 39 
paragraph F, because its content is moved to section 1101.  40 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR0540(01) -1 
 Part F of the bill does the following:  1 
1.  Amends Title 30 -A, section 3821, subsection 3 to clarify that hotel and lodging 2 
house registers must  be kept for 2 years and must be available for inspection by an agent 3 
of the authority that licenses the hotel or lodging house; and  4 
2.  Amends Title 34 -A, section 1216, subsection 1, paragraph D to clarify that 5 
dissemination of certain information pertain ing to a person receiving services from the 6 
Department of Corrections may be made to any criminal justice agency if necessary to 7 
carry out the "administration of criminal justice" as separately defined pursuant to the 8 
Criminal History Record Information Ac t and the Intelligence and Investigative Record 9 
Information Act, and to carry out the "administration of juvenile criminal justice" and the 10 
"administration of juvenile justice" as separately defined pursuant to the Maine Juvenile 11
