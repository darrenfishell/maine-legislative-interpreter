SUMMARY  10 
This bill makes clear that an attorney who is employed by the State to provide 11 
volunteer legal services as long as the volunteer legal services do not create a conflict of 12 
interest with the attorney's work for the State.  A conflict of interest exists if there  is a 13 
substantial risk that the attorney's representation of the State as a client would be 14 
materially and adversely affected by the attorney's duties pursuant to the provision of the 15 
volunteer legal services.  Current law prohibits the Attorney General an d family law 16 
magistrates from engaging in the private practice of law, and this bill retains those 17 
prohibitions.  18
