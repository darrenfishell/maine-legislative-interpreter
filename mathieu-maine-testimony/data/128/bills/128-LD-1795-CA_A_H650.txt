SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "fl" to H.P. 1239, L.D. 1795, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Maine Criminal Code and Related Statutes as Reconunended by the Criminal 
Law Advisory Commission" 
Amend the bill by inserting after section 1 the following: 
'Sec. 2. 15 MRSA ยง3314, sub~ยงl, 1G, as amended by PL 2009, c. 93, ยง12, is 
further amended to read: 
G. Except for a violation of section 3103, subsection 1, paragraph H, the court may 
impose a fine, subject to Title 17-A, sections 1301 to 1304, except that there is no 
mandatory minimum fine amount. For the purpose of this section, juvenile offenses 
defined in section 3103, subsection 1, paragraphs Band Care AAAml'lil C:l.11111: R ArimAi;: 
subject to a fine ofup to $1,000.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment eliminates 
the reference to the fine amount for Class E crimes to avoid confusion regarding the 
status of the juvenile crimes of possession of under 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana, possession 
of drug paraphernalia, illegal transportation of drugs by a minor and certain offenses 
involving alcoholic beverages. Instead, the amendment changes the language of the 
provision to explicitly state that the maximum fine is $1,000. The amendment does not 
change th.e maximum fine.
