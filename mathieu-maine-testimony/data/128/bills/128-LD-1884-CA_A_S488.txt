This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. 
Part A of the amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
1. It limits the categories of individuals who may petition for a community protection 
order to include only a law enforcement officer, a former or current spouse or domestic 
partner of the subject of the petition, an individual who formerly was or currently is living 
with the subject of the petition as a spouse, the parent of a child of the subject of the 
petition and household members related by consanguinity or affinity to the subject of the 
petition. 
2. It changes the definition of "high-risk individual" to remove references to mental 
illness. 
3. It enumerates specific factors that a court must consider when deciding whether to 
issue a temporary or extended community protection order. 
4. It reduces the duration of a temporary community protection order from 21 days to 
14 days. 
5. It removes the prohibition on ownership of a firearm by a restrained individual but 
continues to prohibit a restrained individual from having a firearm in the individual's 
custody or control or purchasing, possessing or receiving or attempting to purchase or 
receive a firearm. 
6. It authorizes the court to issue a search warrant authorizing a law enforcement 
officer to seize any firearms that there is probable cause to believe the restrained 
individual possesses either concurrently with or subsequent to issuance of a temporary or 
extended community protection order. 
7. It permits an individual restrained by an extended community protection order to 
submit one written request to dissolve the extended community protection order and 
requires law enforcement to update the Department of Public Safety database for 
protection orders when a community protection order is dissolved. 
8. It requires, prior to the return of a firearm to an individual who was restrained by 
an expired or dissolved community protection order, that the law enforcement agency 
provide notice of the return of the firearm to the petitioner, if the petitioner is a family or 
household member of the restrained individual. 
9. It requires law enforcement agencies to exercise reasonable care to avoid loss, 
damage or reduction in value of firearms surrendered by or seized from restrained 
individuals and provides that the Maine Tort Claims Act governs liability of law 
enforcement for damage to or reduction in value of such firearms.

Part B of the amendment authorizes a court to order a person admitted to a 
progressive treatment program not to possess firearms, muzzle-loading firearms, bows, 
crossbows or other specified dangerous weapons for the duration of the patient's court­
ordered participation in the program. Possession of a firearm by a patient in violation of 
such an order is a Class D crime. A law enforcement officer to whom a patient

value of the surrendered firearm.

information technology costs for case management system changes.
