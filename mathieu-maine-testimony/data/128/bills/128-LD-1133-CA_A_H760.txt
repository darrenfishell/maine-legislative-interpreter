This amendment allows a residential service provider to apply to the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) for time-limited services in order to meet a patient's needs when the patient requires reasonable 
accommodations or a higher level of care for admission or readmission to the residential service provider. It directs 
lhe DHHS to provide the residential service provider with technical support in seeking MaineCare reimbursement, 
when applicable. Implementing this bill will increase MaineCare costs for residential care facilities (RCF), as some 
members will receive additional services. However, that increase could potentially be offset by the savings that occur 
when moving a member to this lower cost setting from a higher cost inpatient facility. This bill will be repealed July 
1, 2020, allowing the department to gather infonnation about the cost and savings associated with these members and 
report back to the legislature with their findings. As it is not known presicely what services will be required, how 
many members will receive the services, how much sooner they are readmitted to the RCF and the associated savings 
achieved by moving from a higher cost inpatient facility to a lower cost RCF, a more complete estimate cannot be 
made at this time. 
It has been estimated that 10 to 25 individuals would apply for this service in a given year, based on the experience in 
previous years, so the additional costs to the DHHS to receive and process the applications and report to the joint 
standing committee having jmisdiction over health and human services matters on the outcomes are expected to be 
minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
