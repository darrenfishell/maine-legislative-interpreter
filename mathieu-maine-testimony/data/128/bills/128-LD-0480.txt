families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance for families described in this 11 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  12 
(1)  To continue the pass -through of the first $50 per month of current child 13 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 14 
tests and benefit calculations;  15 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 16

Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of 18 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 19 
aliens under PRWO RA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 20 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 21 
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  22 
July 1, 2011 may continue to recei ve assistance, as long as that household 23 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 24 
for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 25 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an app lication pending for assistance 26 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 27 
through a state -funded program unless that noncitizen is:  28

security income in 42 United States Code, Sections 1381 to 1383f (2010);  30

gross income test only to applicants and not to recipients;  30 
(8)  In cases when the TANF recipient has no child care cost, the monthly TANF 31 
benefit is the maximum payment level or the difference between the countable 32 
earnings and the standard of need established by rule adopted by the department, 33
