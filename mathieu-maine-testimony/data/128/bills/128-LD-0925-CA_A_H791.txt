of occupancy less than 70%. For fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 and thereafter, the 
reduction in allowable cost applies only for an annual level of occupancy less than 85% 
for facilities with 61 or more beds and 80% for facilities with 60 or fewer beds. 
3. Low-cost, high Medicaid nursing facilities. Beginning July 1, 2019, the 
supplemental payment established by Public Law 2013, chapter 594, section 3, subsection 
5 must be revised to provide that the supplemental payment increases to 60¢ per resident 
day, is not subject to cost settlement and must be retained by the facility in its entirety for 
any nursing facility whose MaineCare residents constitute more than 80% of the nursing 
facility's total number ofresidents and whose base year direct and routine aggregate costs 
per day are less than the median aggregate direct and routine allowable costs for the 
facility's peer group. The supplemental payment must continue to apply as provided in 
Public Law 2013, chapter 594, section 3, subsection 5 for facilities that do not meet the 
standard set forth in this subsection.
