The bill includes Federal Block Grant Fund allocations to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 
$73,936 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $151,811 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 2 Eligiblity Specialist positions to perform the 
audits of recipients of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. 
The TANF program may realize savings from amounts deducted from recipients' benefits. DHHS may not be able to 
deduct the full amount of an improper transaction the following month from a recipient's benefits due to current 
TANF recoupment rules that allow DHHS to only deduct 10% of the maximum TANF benefit or 30% if the recipient 
is receiving less than the maximum. DHHS would need to develop a process that adheres to a client's right for due 
process.
