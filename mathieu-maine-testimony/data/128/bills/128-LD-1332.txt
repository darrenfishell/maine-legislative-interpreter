 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  15 MRSA ยง393, sub -ยง2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 424, Pt. A, ยง5, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
2.  Application after 5 years.   A person subject to the provisions of subsection 1, 4 
paragraph  A-1, subparagraphs 1 to 4  or paragraph  C as a result of a conviction or 5 
adjudication may, after the expiration of 5 years from the date that the person is finally 6 
discharged from the sentences imposed as a result of the conviction or adjudication, apply 7 
to the commissioner for a permit to carry a firearm subject to subsection 4.  That person 8 
may not be issued a permit to carry a concealed handgun pursuant to Title 25, chapter 9 
252.  A permit issued pursuant to this subsection is valid for 4 years from the d ate of 10 
issue unless sooner revoked for cause by the commissioner.  For purposes of this 11 
subsection, "firearm" does not include a firearm defined under 18 United States Code, 12 
Section 921(3).  13 
SUMMARY  14 
Currently, the only nonconcealed firearm permit that the C ommissioner of Public 15 
Safety grants to a person convicted of certain crimes, formerly known as felonies, is a 16 
permit to possess a black powder weapon, also known as a muzzle -loading firearm.  This 17 
bill repeals the provisions in law allowing a person convic ted of certain crimes that 18 
involve the use of a firearm against a person or any other dangerous person to obtain a 19 
permit to carry a nonconcealed firearm 5 years after the discharge of the person's sentence 20 
through an application process with the commissio ner. 21
