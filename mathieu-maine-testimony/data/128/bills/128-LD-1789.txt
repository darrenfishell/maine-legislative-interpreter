8 Agriculture, Conservation  and Forestry may sell or exchange lands with the approval of

26 SUMMARY
27 This bill transfers those leases of public  reserved lands granted by an act of the 
28 Legislature before  the establishment of an agency  in the executive branch of State 
29 Government for managing leases of public  reserved lands to the Department of 
30 Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,  Bureau of Parks and Lands.
31 It authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands  to sell certain parcels of 
32 public reserved lands on the southwest side of West Richardson Pond  to the individual 
33 lessees, sell another  lot in that area via public sale and enter into a land exchange to 
34 separate common  and divided interests in a  parcel  of land in  Aroostook County.
35 It amends  Resolve  2015, chapter 29, which authorized the partitioning  and 
36 consolidation of common  and undivided  interests  in the Scopan  Unit and other locations.   
37 Chapter 29 involved lands in Township 11, Range  4 WELS, Township 13, Range 13 
38 WELS and Township 12, Range 13 WELS, which are not owned by the same group of 
39 owners as those lands involved in the proposed partition of interests  in Township 10, 
40 Range 4 WELS  and Township 13, Range 5 WELS.   At present,  the partitioning and 
Page 5 - 128LR2738(01)-11 exchange of interests  in Township 10, Range  4 WELS and Township 13, Range 5 WELS 
2 are ready to move forward.   The bill amends  chapter 29 to allow  the Township 10, Range 
3 4 WELS  and Township 13, Range 5 WELS transaction to take place and further 
4 authorizes negotiations by the bureau for the State's acquisition  of all of the minority 
5 common and undivided interests in Township 11, Range  4 WELS E/2 owned by parties  
6 whose interests are managed  by Prentiss and Carlisle  Management Company.
