This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment renames 
the Seaweed Advisory Council, as it is named in the bill, the Seaweed Fisheries Advisory 
Council. It also adds a member who harvests seaweed and a member of the public to the 
council. The amendment removes the requirement that the council make 
recommendations to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
over marine resources matters and removes the provision in the bill that allows the chair 
of the council to call meetings of the council.
