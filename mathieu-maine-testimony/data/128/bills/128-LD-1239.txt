SUMMARY  26 
This bil l implements several recommendations of a review panel created by the 27 
Governor to review operations of the Maine Human Rights Commission.  28 
Under the bill, if both parties are in agreement, the commission is authorized to make 29 
binding determinations pertaini ng to violations of the Maine Human Rights Act.  The 30 
commission is authorized to order remedies that the court is currently authorized to 31 
impose.  Final decisions of the commission are appealable under the Maine 32 
Administrative Procedure Act as final agency  actions.  33 
The bill provides for the commission to suspend an investigation if a complainant 34 
files an affidavit with the commission stating that the complainant will seek a right -to-sue 35 
letter when permitted under law.  Current law allows a complainant to a sk for a right -to- 36 
sue letter, bypassing the commission findings, after 180 days have elapsed since the 37 
complaint was filed.  Because the commission will suspend the investigation once the 38 GENERAL FUND  2017 -18 2018 -19

complainant may not withdraw the affidavit.  2 
The bill provides for the commission to issue a right -to-sue letter to a complainant if 3 
180 days have elapsed since the complaint was filed and the commission has not filed a 4 
civil action in the case and has not entered into a conciliation agreement in the case.  5 
The bill corrects the format of language concerning the issuance of subpoenas.  6 
The bill authorizes the commission to impose sanctions and seek penalties for 7 
perjury, false swearing, making  a false statement, providing false information or violating 8 
the nondisclosure requirements.  Sanctions may include the imposition of adverse 9 
inference, liability or other remedies.  10 
The bill authorizes the commission to establish by rule procedures to disc ourage 11 
abuse of the complaint and investigation process.  These procedures may include, but are 12 
not limited to, refusing to accept more than 5 complaints from the same complainant in a 13 
12-month period and other requirements designed to eliminate the filing  of frivolous 14 
complaints.  15 
The bill provides funding for 2 new paralegal positions and one new consumer 16 
outreach position.  Currently, investigators are performing intake functions; paralegal 17 
positions dedicated to intake will allow the investigators to con centrate on investigating 18 
and completing cases.  The consumer outreach position will provide public information 19 
about the Maine Human Rights Act and rules, which will increase compliance.  The 20 
consumer outreach position will also provide information about the operations of the 21 
commission.  22 
The bill directs the commission to purchase a computer system to provide for 23 
electronic data management that allows parties and their attorneys to access the status of 24 
their cases electronically.  25
