 SUMMARY  1 
This bill implements the recommendations of the Commission To Study the Public 2 
Reserved Lands Management Fund.  3 
The bill establishes additional guidelines that must  be followed by the Department of 4 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry before it may adopt any rule that would make 5 
changes to the annual allowable harvesting level for public reserved lands and 6 
nonreserved public lands.  The bill directs the department to conduct a detailed forest 7 
inventory of the State's public reserved lands and nonreserved public lands by March 15, 8 
2018 and every 5 years thereafter.  9 
The bill prohibits any expenditures from the Public Reserved Lands Management 10 
Fund other than for the g eneral operations of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the 11 
department with respect to management of public reserved lands, unless the fund has at 12 
least $2,500,000 at the start of the fiscal year.  The bill requires the bureau's annual report 13 
dealing wit h public reserved lands to include a breakdown of growth based on the most 14 
recent physical forest inventory and of harvest in each region of any public reserved lands 15 
units established by the bureau, identifying any harvesting that occurred during the 16 
preceding fiscal year in individual management units where harvest exceeds annual 17 
growth.  18 
The bill directs the bureau to establish an educational grant program to provide one - 19 
time grants to eligible public secondary and postsecondary institutions for education al 20 
programs related to logging.  Funding for the grants comes from the Public Reserved 21 
Lands Management Fund.  22 
The bill directs the bureau to identify areas where the State does not currently have 23 
deeded access to the State's public reserved lands.  The bil l also requires the bureau to 24 
direct regional foresters in the bureau who are familiar with the physical landscape and 25 
landowners to develop goals and priorities regarding increased access to the State's public 26 
reserved lands and requires the bureau to sub mit their findings to the joint standing 27 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over public reserved lands matters by 28 
March 1, 2019.  29 
The bill directs the bureau to develop a statewide priority list of recreational 30 
infrastructure projects for the State's public reserved lands and a statewide priority list of 31 
projects under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for the State's public 32 
reserved lands.  The priority lists must be presented to the joint standing committee of the 33 
Legislatur e having jurisdiction over public reserved lands matters by March 1, 2019.  34 
After receipt of the lists, the joint standing committee is required to hold a meeting for the 35 
purpose of obtaining public input related to the lists.  36 
Finally, the bill directs the  bureau to review its bid process for timber harvesting and 37 
road construction projects, including any liability concerns related to the bid process.  38 
The bureau is directed to report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 39 
jurisdiction ov er public reserved lands matters with any recommended changes to the bid 40 
process by March 15, 2018.  The bill also provides allocations for educational grants, 41
