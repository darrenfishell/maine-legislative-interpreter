vaccine under this paragraph shall notify the practitioner who issued the prescription, 
protocol or standing order of the administration within 3 business days as required by 
section 13 83 3, subsection 3. 
C. A pharmacist may administer a vaccine licensed by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration that is outside the guidelines recommended on the 
recommended immunization schedule of the United States Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or successor 
organization, to a person 18 years of age or older according to a valid prescription 
from the person's primary care physician or a nurse practitioner with whom the 
person has an existing relationship or from an authorized practitioner in this State if 
the prescription specifically states that the vaccine is medically necessary. A 
pharmacist who administers a vaccine under this paragraph shall notify the 
practitioner who issued the prescription of the administration within 3 business days 
as required by section 13833, subsection 3.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
reorganizes the law that allows pharmacists to administer vaccines other than the 
influenza vaccine. Under the amendment, pharmacists may administer booster vaccines 
listed on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended 
immunization schedule to a person 11 years of age or older and under 18 years of age 
according to a valid prescription from the person's primary care physician or nurse 
practitioner as long as the phannacist notifies the prescriber of the administration within 3 
business days. 
This amendment also authorizes pharmacists to administer vaccines on the 
recommended immunization schedule to adults according to a valid prescription, 
treatment protocol or written standing order from an authorized practitioner in this State. 
This amendment retains the requirement in current law that a pharmacist may not 
administer a vaccine that is not on the recommended immunization schedule unless the 
adult seeking the vaccine has a valid prescription stating that the vaccine is medically 
necessary.
