CHAPTER 145  3 
INTERSTATE MEDICAL L ICENSURE COMPACT  4 
§18501.  Short title  5 
This chapter may be known and cited as "the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact ." 6 
§18502.  Purpose  7 
In order to strengthen access to health care and in recognition of the advances in the 8 
delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact 9 
have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive proce ss that complements the 10 
existing licensing and regulatory authority of state member boards and provides a 11 
streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby 12 
enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The 13 
compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's 14 
existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for 15 
licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at 16 
the time of the physician -patient encounter and therefore requires the physician to be 17 
under the jurisdiction of the state member board where the patient is located. State 18 
member boards that participate in the compact retain  the jurisdiction to impose an adverse 19 
action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the 20 
procedures in the compact.  21 
This compact is the Maine enactment of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact as 22 
revised by th e Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission.  The form, format and 23 
text of the compact have been changed minimally so as to conform to Maine statutory 24 
conventions.  The changes are technical in nature and it is the intent of the Legislature 25 
that this  Act be interpreted as substantively the same as the Interstate Medical Licensure 26 
Compact that is enacted by other member states.  27

2.  Officers.  The interstate commission shall elect o r appoint annually from among 10 
its commissioners a chair, a vice -chair and a treasurer, each of whom has the authority 11 
and duties as specified in the bylaws. The chair, or in the chair's absence or disability, the 12 
vice-chair, shall preside at all meetings o f the interstate commission.  13 
3.  Remuneration.  Officers selected in subsection 2 serve without remuneration 14

claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or 18 
arising out of, or relating to, an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or 19 
that that officer or employee has a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the 20 
scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that that 21 
officer or employee is not protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury  or 22

for damage, loss or injury caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct 33 
of the executive director, representative or employee.  34

the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, as long as 40 
the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful 41

§18516.  Rule -making functions of the interstate commission  10 
1.  Rules.  The interstate commission shall adopt reasonable rules, which are routine 11 
technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, in order to effectively 12 
and efficiently a chieve the purposes of the compact; however, if the interstate 13 
commission exercises its rule -making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of 14 
the purposes of the compact or the powers granted under the compact, then such an action 15 
by the interstate  commission is invalid and has no force or effect.  16 
2.  Rules conformation.  Rules for the operations of the interstate commission must 17 
be adopted pursuant to a rule -making process that substantially conforms to the "Revised 18 
Model State Administrative Proce dure Act" (2010), as amended, of the National 19 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  20 
3.  Judicial review.  Not later than 30 days after a rule is adopted, a person may file a 21 
petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States Distric t Court for the District 22 
of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal 23 
offices, as long as the filing of such a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule 24 
from becoming effective unless the court finds that  the petitioner has a substantial 25 
likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate 26 
commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule to be unlawful if the 27 
rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the interstate commission.  28 
§18517.  Oversight of interstate compact  29 
1.  Enforcement.  The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state 30 
government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions 31 
necess ary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions 32 
of the compact and the rules adopted under the compact have standing as statutory law 33 
but do not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.  34 
2.  Courts.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any 35 
judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of 36 
the compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the inter state 37 
commission.  38 
3.  Service of process.  The interstate commission is entitled to receive all service of 39 
process in any proceeding under subsection 2 and has standing to intervene in the 40 
proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate 41 
 
 Page 13 - 128LR0532(01) -1 
 commission renders a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, the 1 
compact or adopted rules.  2 
§18518.  Enforcement of interstate compact  3 
1.  Enforcement.  The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 4 
discretio n, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact.  5 
2.  Compliance.  The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the 6 
commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of 7 
Columbia or, at the discretion of  the interstate commission, in the federal district where 8 
the interstate commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the 9 
provisions of the compact and its adopted rules and bylaws against a member state in 10 
default. The relief sought may  include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 11 
judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 12 
litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.  13 
3.  Remedies.  The remedies in this section are not the ex clusive remedies of the 14 
interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies 15 
available under state law or the regulation of a profession.  16 
§18519.  Default procedures  17 
1.  Grounds.  The grounds for default under section 185 18 include, but are not 18 
limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities 19 
imposed upon it by the compact or the rules and bylaws of the interstate commission 20 
adopted under the compact.  21 
2.  Default.  If the interstate com mission determines that a member state has 22 
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact or 23 
the bylaws or adopted rules, the interstate commission shall:  24 
A.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other m ember states of the 25 
nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the 26 
interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by 27 
which the defaulting state must cure its default; and  28 
B.  Provide remedi al training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.  29 
3.  Termination.  If a defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state 30 
must be terminated from the compact in accordance with subsection 4 upon an 31 
affirmative vote of a m ajority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges and benefits 32 
conferred by the compact terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the 33 
default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the 34 
perio d of the default.  35 
4.  Notice of intent.  Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed 36 
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent 37 
to terminate must be given by the interstate commission to the governor  of the defaulting 38 
state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the 39 
member states.  40 
 
 Page 14 - 128LR0532(01) -1 
 5.  Rules.  The interstate commission shall adopt rules pursuant to section 18516 and 1 
procedures to address licenses and physic ians that are materially affected by the 2 
termination of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.  3 
6.  Obligations.  A member state that has been terminated is responsible for all dues, 4 
obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective da te of termination, including 5 
obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.  6

has been found to be in default or that has been ter minated from the compact, unless 8 
otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the 9 
defaulting state.  10 
8.  Appeal.  A defaulting state may appeal an action of the interstate commission by 11 
petitioning the United States Distri ct Court for the District of Columbia or the federal 12 
district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 13 
must be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.  14 
§18520.  Dispute resolution  15 
1.  Resolution.  The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a 16 
member state, to resolve disputes that are subject to the compact and that arise among 17 
member states or member boards.  18 
2.  Rules.  The interstate commission shall adopt rules purs uant to section 18516 19 
providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution, as appropriate.  20 
§18521.  Member states, effective date and amendment  21 
1.  Eligibility.  Any state is eligible to become a member state of the compact.  22 
2.  Effective date.  The compact becomes effective and binding upon legislative 23

3.  Participation by nonmemb er states.  The governors of nonmember states, or 26 
their designees, must be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission 27 
on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.  28 
4.  Amendments to compact.  The interstate  commission may propose amendments 29 
to the compact for enactment by the member states. An amendment does not become 30 
effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member states until it is 31 
enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member st ates. 32 
§18522.  Withdrawal  33 
1.  Repeal.  Once effective, the compact continues in force and remains binding upon 34 
each member state, except that a member state may withdraw from the compact by 35 
specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into l aw. 36 
 
 Page 15 - 128LR0532(01) -1 
 2.  Effective date.  Withdrawal from the compact is by the enactment of a statute 1 
repealing the compact, but does not take effect until one year after the effective date of 2 
that statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the w ithdrawing 3 
state to the governor of each other member state.  4 
3.  Intent.  The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chair of the interstate 5 
commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the 6 
withdrawing state.  7

upon the withdrawing state's reenacting the compact or upon such later date as 15 
determined by the interstate commission.  16 
7.  Rules.  The interstate commission is authorized to adopt rules pursuant to section 17 
18516 to address the impact of the withd rawal of a member state on licenses granted in 18 
other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the 19

commission are concluded and surplus funds must be distributed in accordance with the 27 
bylaws.  28
