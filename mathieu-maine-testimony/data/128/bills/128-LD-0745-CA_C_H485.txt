21 This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, elevates from Class B 
22 to Class A the new crime of performing female genital mutilation on a female person 
23 under 18 years of age. The amendment reduces from a Class B to a Class C crime the 
24 first offense of a parent, guardian or custodian of the female person under 18 years of age 
25 in consenting to or permitting the procedure but retains as a Class B crime any 
26 subsequent offenses. The amendment provides a defense to the new crime of female 
27 genital mutilation that, when the procedure was consented to or permitted by a parent, 
28 guardian or custodian of a female person under 18 years of age, the parent, guardian or 
29 custodian was compelled to consent to or permit the procedure by force or by threat of 
30 death or bodily injury to that person or another person. 
31 The amendment also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to 
32 develop, establish and administer a community-based education and outreach program to 
33 provide culturally specific services for communities in the State in which female genital 
34 mutilation of minors might be practiced, including a culturally sensitive professional 
35 training program, and provides funding to implement the program.
