4.  Allocation to landowner.  An Except as otherwise provided in this section, an  9 
antlerless deer permit system adopted by the commissioner pursuant to this section may 10 
include a provision giving special consideration to landowners who keep their lands open 11 
to hu nting by the public.  As part of the special consideration to those landowners, the 12 
commissioner shall  must  provide at least 25% of the  all available antlerless deer permits 13 
in a wildlife management district to eligible landowners that who apply for an ant lerless 14 
deer permit in that district.  For purposes of this subsection, "eligible landowner" means a 15 
landowner of record who owns at least 50 contiguous acres of land and keeps that land 16 
open to hunting by the public.   Any 2 or more areas of land owned by the same person 17 
that are open for hunting and that would be contiguous except for being divided by one or 18 
more roads are considered contiguous for the purposes of determining landowner 19 
eligibility for special consideration  under this subsection.  An eligib le landowner may 20 
receive only one antlerless deer permit under this subsection, which may allow hunting 21 
only in the wildlife management district in which the eligible landowner's property is 22 
located.  An antlerless deer permit issued under this subsection may be transferred 23 
pursuant to subsections 5 and 5 -A. 24 
A.  If the number of eligible landowner applications exceeds the number of antlerless 25 
deer permits available in a wildlife management district, the commissioner shall 26 
establish a lottery system to issue  those permits to eligible landowners.  27 
B.  If the number of antlerless deer permits available in a wildlife management 28 
district exceeds the number of eligible landowner applications, the commissioner 29 
shall issue the remaining permits to junior hunters who apply for an antlerless deer 30 
permit in that district.  If the number of antlerless deer permits available in a wildlife 31 
management district exceeds the number of eligible landowner applications and 32 
junior hunter applications, the commissioner shall issue t he remaining permits as 33 
provided in this section.  34

public and have applied for the permit.  39

 It also provides that if the number of available antlerless deer permits in a wildlife 1 
management district exceeds the number of eligible landowner applicati ons, the 2 
remaining permits must be issued to junior hunters who have applied for an antlerless 3 
deer permit in that district.  If the number of antlerless deer permits available in a wildlife 4 
management district exceeds the number of eligible landowner appl ications and junior 5 
hunter applications, the commissioner is directed to issue the remaining permits as 6 
provided in current law.  7
