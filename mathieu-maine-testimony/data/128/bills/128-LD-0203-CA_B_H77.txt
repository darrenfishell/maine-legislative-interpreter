26 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" g "to H.P. 159, L.D. 203 
Sec. 3. Contingent effective date. That section of this Act that repeals and 
replaces the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 151 does not take effect unless the 
State is placed by the United States Secretary of Transportation in the Atlantic Standard 
Time Zone.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill. 
The amendment does the following. 
1. It requires the Secretary of State to monitor legislative activity in Massachusetts 
and New Hampshire regarding placement of those states in the Atlantic Standard Time 
Zone. 
2. It makes the State's request to the United States Secretary of Transportation to 
place the State in the Atlantic Standard Time Zone contingent on the adoption of the 
Atlantic Standard Time Zone by Massachusetts and New Hampshire and requires the 
Secretary of State to notify the Revisor of Statutes and the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over state and local government matters when the United 
States Secretary of Transportation has approved placement of the State in the Atlantic 
Standard Time Zone. 
3. The bill exempts the State from daylight saving time. The amendment provides 
that if the State is placed by the United States Secretary of Transportation in the Atlantic 
Standard Time Zone, the State no longer observes daylight saving time and Atlantic 
Standard Time is the standard time throughout the year without advancement during any 
period. 
4. The bill, contingent on a time zone change, changes the law governing periods of 
closure for hauling lobster traps. The amendment does not retain that provision.
