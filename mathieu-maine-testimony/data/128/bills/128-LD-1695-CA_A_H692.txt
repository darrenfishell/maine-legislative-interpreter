15 COMMTITEE AMENDMENT"~" to H.P. 1175, L.D. 1695 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. The amendment does the following. 
1. It prohibits a parent from transferring a child from one primary or secondary 
school to a different primary or secondary school without the consent of all other persons 
having parental rights with respect to the child unless a court of competent jurisdiction 
has awarded the parent sole parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child or 
has allocated to the parent the right to make education decisions for the child or the right 
to enroll the child in school. It requires the parent who seeks to transfer the child from 
one primary or secondary school to another primary or secondary school to provide 
written documentation demonstrating the parent's authority to enroll the child. 
2. It authorizes a court that is determining parental rights and responsibilities to 
consider the fact that a parent who has not been granted the authority to make school 
enrollment decisions for a child has transferred the child to a different primary or 
secondary school without the consent of other persons having parental rights.
