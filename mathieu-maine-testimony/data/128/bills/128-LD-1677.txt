Page 1 - 128LR2703(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  32 MRSA §11013, sub-§9, ¶D, as enacted  by PL 2017, c. 216, §5, is 
3 amended to read:
4 D.  The  principal amount  due at charge-off;
5 SUMMARY
6 This bill amends the law regarding the information that a debt buyer must possess for 
7 purposes of debt collection by clarifying that the debt buyer must possess not the 
8 principal amount  due the original creditor at charge -off, when the creditor  removed the 
9 debt from its books as an asset and began to treat it as a loss or expense because payment  
10 was unlikely,  as in current law, but rather  the total  amount  due at charge-off.
