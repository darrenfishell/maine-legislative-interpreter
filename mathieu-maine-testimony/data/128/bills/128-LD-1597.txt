Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §2144, sub -§4, ¶C is enacted to read:  2

SUMMARY  5 
Under current law, a fee is imposed on each container of paint of 5 gallons or less 6 
sold in this State.  The fee is imposed on retailers and distributors but then added to the 7 
retail cost of paint sold by that retailer or distributor.  The f ee is used to fund a paint 8 
stewardship program, which provides for the collection, recycling and disposal of old 9 
paint.  10 
This bill exempts from the sales and use tax the fee imposed to fund the paint 11 
stewardship program, regardless of whether the fee is pai d by a retailer or distributor or 12 
passed on to the consumer.  13
