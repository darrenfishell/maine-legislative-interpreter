This amendment removes the General Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 
of $300,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 for a potential court settlement, as the timing and outcome of a potential settlement 
is unknown. If a court settlement or decision were to occur and was paid by the Surety, the Surety would then be 
entitled to recoup this payment from DHHS. At that time DHHS would need to request an appropriation from the 
legislature to reimburse the Surety.
