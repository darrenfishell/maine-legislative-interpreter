The amendment reduces the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by 
$10,691,281 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $11,661,404 in fiscal year 2018-19 due to a requirement that the rate increases 
in this bill are limited, as necessary, to ensure that aggregate payments for nursing facility services do not exceed the 
upper payment limit established in federal regulations, 42 CFR. §447.272. If the rate increase does not exceed the 
Upper Payment Limit (UPL), the payments will receive the full federal match. The original bill assumed that a large 
portion of the rate increase for Nursing Facilities would be funded 100% by General Fund dollars, as it was expected 
the increase would go well above the UPL. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are increased by $10,691,281 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and $11,661,404 in fiscal year 2018-19 for the increased FMAP match.
