This amendment will transfer $3,000,000 from the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) within the Commission on 
Govemmental Ethics and Election Practices to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund within 10 days of the 
effective date of this bill. (This fiscal note assumes that will occur early in fiscal year 2018-19.) It is anticipated that 
this will leave a cash balance of approximately $1,300,000 in the MCEF. This amendment also reverses this 
transaction later in fiscal year 2018-19 by restoring, on or before Janua1y 1, 2019, the transfer of $3,000,000 from the 
General Fund back to the MCEF, in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21-A, section 1124, subsection 
2, paragraph B. The amendment also reduces the Other Special Revenue Funds allocation in the bill in fiscal year 
2018-19 from $3,976,470 to $2,310,665, a reduction of $1,665,805. This one-time allocation had been included in the 
bill to conect an enor in PL 2017, Chapter 284, Part ZZZZZZ, Section 19 that resulted in a negative allocation in 
fiscal year 2018-19 of $1,010,665. The net allocation after this amendment will be $1 ,300,000, which will allow 
expenditure of the anticipated cash balance after the first transfer described above. As amended, this bill does not 
provide allocation to allow expenditure of the $3,000,000 to be transferred back to the MCEF on or before January 1, 
2019. That allocation will need to be provided either by additional legislative action or by financial order.
