SUMMARY  18 
This bill addresses concerns of caretaker relatives and others who take on the care 19 
and custody of a child whe n the child's parents have essentially abandoned the child to 20 
the caregiver's care and custody.  When the arrangement is without a formal guardianship 21 
appointment and without a power of attorney executed by the parent, the caregiver may 22 
be considered a de facto guardian after sufficient time has elapsed with a demonstrated 23 
lack of consistent participation by the parent.  A de facto guardian may petition the court 24 
to be appointed as a guardian when the parent does not consent to the appointment if the 25 
court finds a demonstrated lack of consistent participation by the parent.  Current law 26 
provides that the duties of a parent include, but are not limited to, providing the child with 27 
necessary food, clothing, shelter, health care and education and a nurturing an d consistent 28 
relationship and other care and control necessary for the child's physical, mental and 29 
emotional health and development.  30 
The bill amends the list of factors the court must consider to determine the best 31 
interest of the child when deciding whet her to appoint a guardian for the child to add, if 32 
there has been a demonstrated lack of consistent participation by a parent, the current 33 
capacity and disposition of the parent to comply with the duties imposed upon a parent by 34 
the parent -child relationsh ip. 35 
The bill provides that, if the parent or legal custodian objects to the appointment of 36 
the de facto guardian as the guardian for the child, the court may appoint the de facto 37 
guardian as the guardian if the court finds that the parent or legal custodia n is currently 38 
unwilling or unable to comply with the duties imposed upon a parent by the parent -child 39 
relationship.  40

 The bill provides that, after the de facto guardian is appointed the guardian and the 1 
parent petitions the court to terminate the guardians hip, a party opposing the termination 2 
has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent seeking to 3 
terminate the guardianship is currently unfit to regain custody of the child.  In 4 
determining whether a parent is unfit to regain custody, if the guardian was appointed 5 
because of a demonstrated lack of consistent participation by the parent, the court shall 6 
require the parent to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent is willing 7 
and able to comply with the duties imp osed upon a parent by the parent -child 8 
relationship.  9
