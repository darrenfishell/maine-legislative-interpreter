 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub -§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
1.  Minimum wage.   The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 4 
1, 2017, the minimum h ourly wage is $9.00 per hour ; starting January 1, 2018, the 5 
minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 6 
wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is 7 
$12.00 per hour .  On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum 8 
hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living. 9 
The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as 10 
of August of the pr evious year over the level as of August of the year preceding that year 11 
in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, CPI -W, for 12 
the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United States 13 
Department of Labor,  Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the amount 14 
of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.   If the highest 15 
federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect under this 16 
section, the minim um wage under this section is increased to the same amount, effective 17 
on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage , and must be increased in 18 
accordance with this section thereafter . 19 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §664, sub -§2, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2 , §2, is further 20 
amended to read:  21 
2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 22 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 23 
established in this section.  Starting January 1, 2017, the min imum cash wage paid 24 
directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour, and the tip 25 
credit may not exceed the difference between the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 26 
tipped service employee and the minimum hourly wage established  under subsection 1.  27 
Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January 1st thereafter, the minimum cash wage 28 
paid directly to a tipped service employee must be increased by an additional $1.00 per 29 
hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually adjusted  minimum hourly wage 30 
established under subsection 1, except that if the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 31 
tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less than the annually adjusted minimum 32 
hourly wage, it must be increased by that lesser amount.   An emp loyer who elects to use 33 
the tip credit , until it is eliminated under this subsection,  must inform the affected 34 
employee in advance and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the 35 
minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are  combined.  Upon a 36 
satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's representative that the actual tips 37 
received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall increase the direct wages by the 38 
difference.  39 
The tips received by a service employee be come the property of the employee and may 40 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 41 
bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 42 
employee.  A tip that is charged to  a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 43 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0265(01) -1 
 employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 1 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill eliminates the $1 per hour increases in the minimum wage s cheduled for 4 
each of the next 3 years and eliminates increases in the minimum wage based on the 5 
increase in the cost of living starting in 2021.  It also restores the tip credit to the 6 
minimum wage laws.  7
