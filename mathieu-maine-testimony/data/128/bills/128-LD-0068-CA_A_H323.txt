6 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment retains the provisions of the bill

8 fisheries, but allows a person who fished with a family member in the 2017 fishing 
9 season on a boat the person does not own to continue fishing from that boat until the boat 
10 is no longer owned by that family member. The amendment also allows a person who 
11 does not meet the boat ownership requirements but who dragged for scallops or sea 
12 urchins and recorded landings in the 2017 fishing season on a boat the person does not 
13 own to continue fishing from that boat until January 1, 2020. 
14 The amendment specifies that the prohibition against fishing for or taking scallops 
15 from April 16th to November 30th applies only to scallop dragging. 
16 The amendment allows the holder of a sea urchin dragging license to possess gear 
17 used for scallop dragging on the boat identified on the sea urchin dragging license if that 
18 boat is also listed on any scallop dragging license and there are no scallops on that boat.
