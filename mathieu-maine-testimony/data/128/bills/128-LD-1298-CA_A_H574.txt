further amended to read: 
C. Discharges to Class B waters may not cause adverse impact to aquatic life in that 
the receiving waters must be of sufficient quality to support all aquatic species 
indigenous to the receiving water without detrimental changes in the resident 
biological community. 
(1) This paragraph does not apply to aquatie pestieide or ehemieal diseharges 
approved by the department and eoadueted by the department, the Departmeat of 
Inlaad Fisheries and Vlildlife or an agSRt of either ageney for the purpose of 
restoriag biologioal eommuaities affeeted by an iavasive speoies. 
(1-A) For the purpose of allowing the discharge of aquatic pesticides or 
chemicals approved by the department and conducted by the department. the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or an agent of either agency to 
restore resident biological communities affected by an invasive species, the 
department may find that the discharged effluent will not cause adverse impact to 
aguatic life as long as the materials and methods used do not cause a significant 
loss of any nontarget species and allow restoration of nontarget species. The 
department may find that an unavoidable, temporary loss of nontarget species 
does not constitute a significant loss of nontarget species. 
(2) For the purpose of allowing the discharge of aquatic pesticides approved by 
the department for the control of mosquito-borne diseases in the interest of public 
health and safety, the department may fmd that the discharged effluent will not 
cause adverse impact to aquatic life as long as the materials and methods used 
provide protection for nontarget species. When the department issues a license 
for the discharge of aquatic pesticides authorized under this subparagraph, the 
department shall notify the municipality in which the application is licensed to 
occur and post the notice on the department's publicly accessible website. 
Sec. 8. 38 MRSA §465, sub-§4, ~' as repealed and replaced by PL 2005, c.

B. The dissolved oxygen content of Class C water may ae not be less than 5 parts per

fish, the following standards apply. 
(1) The 30-day average dissolved oxygen criterion of a Class C water is 6.5 parts 
per million using a temperature of 22 degrees centigrade or the ambient 
temperature of the water body, whichever is less, if: 
(a) A license or water quality certificate other than a general permit was 
issued prior to March 16, 2004 for the Class C water and was not based on a 
6.5 parts per million 30-day average dissolved oxygen criterion; or 
(b) A discharge or a hydropower project was in existence on March 16, 
2005 and required but did not have a license or water quality certificate other 
than a general permit for the Class C water. 
This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and water quality certificates 
issued on or after March 16, 2004. 
(2) In Class C waters not governed by subparagraph (1), dissolved oxygen may 
not be less than 6.5 parts per million as a 30-day average based upon a 
temperature of 24 degrees centigrade or the ambient temperature of the water 
body, whichever is less. This criterion for the water body applies to licenses and 
water quality certificates issued on or after March 16, 2004. 
The department may negotiate and enter into agreements with licensees and water 
quality certificate holders in order to provide further protection for the growth of 
indigenous fish. Agreements entered into under this paragraph are enforceable as 
department orders according to the provisions of sections 347-A to 349. 
Between May April 15th and Septemher 30th October 31st, the number of 
Escherichia coli bacteria of hl:Hllali aad dom.estie animal origin in Class C waters may 
not exceed a geometric mean of -bU 100 CFU per 100 milliliters over a 90-day 
interval or an mstantaneous le-vel of 236 CFU per 100 milliliters in more than 10% of 
the samples in any 90-day interval. In determming hlimaa aad domestie aRimal

designation of spawning areas. Those rules must include provision for periodic 
review of designated spawning areas and consultation with affected persons prior to 
designation of a stretch of water as a spawning area. 
Sec. 9. 38 MRSA §465, sub-§4, ,re, as amended by PL 2005, c. 182, §5, is 
further amended to read: 
C. Discharges to Class C waters may cause some changes to aquatic life, except that 
the receiving waters must be of sufficient quality to support all species of fish 
indigenous to the receiving waters and maintain the structure and function of the

SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the provisions of the bill that update Maine's water quality 
standards by aligning state law with federal Clean Water Act requirements for pesticide 
application to control invasive plants and mosquito-borne disease and adds provisions to 
align state law with such requirements for dissolved oxygen. The amendment further 
updates Maine's water quality standards to be consistent with guidance issued by the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency regarding recreational water quality 
criteria for bacteria. The amendment retains the provision of the bill that authorizes the 
Department of Environmental Protection to use an alternative low-flow requirement when 
assessing the impact of nutrients on water quality, contingent upon the department's 
adopting nutrient rules.

Minor cost increase • General Fund 
This bill will update Maine's water quality standards by aligning state law with federal Clean Water Act requirements 
for water quality standards. Any additional costs to the Department of Environmental Protection to conduct 
rulemaking and implement the changes are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
