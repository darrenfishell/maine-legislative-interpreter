 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the open -water fishing season is scheduled to begin April 1, 2017; and  3 
Whereas, weather co nditions are still conducive to ice fishing in some areas of the 4 
State; and  5 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 6 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 7 
immediately ne cessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 8 
therefore,  9 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  10 
Sec. 1.  12 MRSA §12456, sub -§2, ¶E, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 3, §2, is 11 
amended to read:  12 
E.  In accordance w ith section 10104, the commissioner may change the established 13 
opening or closing  date of an open season if, in the commissioner's opinion, the 14 
change is necessary  warranted  due to earlier -than-normal seasonal temperature 15 
changes or  weather conditions.  16 
Eme rgency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 17 
legislation takes effect when approved.  18 
SUMMARY  19 
Current law allows the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to change the 20 
date of the opening of a fishing season due to seasonal temperature changes or weather 21 
conditions.  22 
This bill eliminates the reference to seasonal temperature changes and allows the 23 
commissioner to change both the opening and closing dates of a fishing season based on 24 
weather conditions.  25
