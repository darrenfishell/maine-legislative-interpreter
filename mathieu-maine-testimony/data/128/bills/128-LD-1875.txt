27 annuity contracts; and
28 C.  Benefits provided  by a long- term care rider to a life insurance policy  or annuity 
29 contract are considered  the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy  or 
30 annuity contract to which  the rider relates.
31 Sec. 3.  24-A MRSA §4603,  sub-§1-A,  as amended by PL 2005, c. 346, §2 and 
32 affected by §16,  is further amended to read:
33 1-A.  Persons covered.  This chapter provides  coverage for the policies and contracts 
34 specified in subsection 1:
35 A.  To any person, regardless of where the person  resides, except for a nonresident 
36 certificate holder under a group policy or contract, who is the beneficiary, assignee  or 
37 payee, including a health care provider rendering services covered under a health 
38 insurance policy or certificate, of a person covered under paragraph B;
39 B.  To any person  who owns, or is a certificate holder or enrollee under, a policy or 
40 contract specified in subsection 1, other  than a structured settlement annuity, who:
Page 2 - 128LR2896(01)-11 (1)  Is a resident; or
2 (2)  Is not a resident, if all  the following conditions are  met:
3 (a)  The  insurer that  issued the policy  or contract is domiciled in this State;
4 (b)  The insurer never held a license  or certificate of authority in the state in 
5 which the person  resides;
6 (c)  The state in which  the person resides has an association similar to the 
7 Maine Life  and Health Insurance Guaranty  Association; and
8 (d)  The person is not eligible for coverage by the association in that state; 
9 and
10 C.  To any person who is a payee under a structured  settlement annuity, or to a 
11 beneficiary or  beneficiaries  of a payee  if the payee  is deceased,  if the payee:
12 (1)  Is a resident, regardless  of where the contract owner resides; or
13 (2)  Is not a resident, if all  of the  conditions of  either division (a) or (b) are met:
14 (a)  The  contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident;  or

21 (iii)  The payee or beneficiary and the contract owner are not  eligible  for 
22 coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract 
23 owner resides.
24 This chapter does not provide coverage to a person who is a payee or beneficiary  of a 
25 contract owner who is a resident  of this State if the payee or beneficiary is afforded 
26 any coverage by  a similar association of another state.
27 This chapter  is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident,  and, in special  
28 circumstances as provided  by this section,  to a person who is not a resident.   In order to 
29 avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under  this 
30 chapter is provided coverage  under the laws of any other state, that person  may not be 
31 provided coverage under this chapter.  In determining the application of the provisions of 
32 this subsection in a situation  in which  a person could be covered by the association of 
33 more than one state,  whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary, enrollee or assignee,  this 
34 chapter must  be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage  by 
35 only one association.

26 annuitants had a right under law or the terminated  policy or annuity to convert

5 adopts, subject to prior approval of the superintendent .  The premium must 
6 reflect the amount of insurance to be provided  and the age and class  of risk of 
7 each insured, but may not reflect any changes in the health of the insured  
8 after the original  policy  was last underwritten; and
9 (e)  Any alternative policy issued  by the association must provide  coverage  
10 of a type similar to that of the policy issued by the impaired or insolvent 
11 insurer, as determined by the association.
12 (5)  If the association elects  to reissue terminated coverage at a premium  rate 
13 different from that charged under the terminated policy, the premium  must be 
14 actuarially justified  and set by the association in accordance  with the amount of 
15 insurance coverage provided  and the age and class of risk, subject to approval of 
16 the superintendent  and the receivership  court .

22 carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association  shall assure  the 
23 payment or crediting of a rate of  interest consistent with section 4603.
24 (8)  Nonpayment of premiums within 31 days after the date required under the 
25 terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative  or reissued  policy or contract or 
26 substitute coverage  terminates the association's obligations under the policy or 
27 coverage under this chapter  with respect to the policy or coverage,  except  with 
28 respect to any claims  incurred or any net cash surrender value that may be due in 
29 accordance with the  provisions of  this chapter.
30 (9)  Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an 
31 insolvent insurer belong to and are payable  at the direction of the association,  and 
32 the association is liable  for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners  
33 arising after the  entry of the order.
34 (10)  The protection provided by this chapter does not apply when any guaranty 
35 protection is provided  to residents of this State  by the laws of the domiciliary 
36 state or jurisdiction  of the  impaired or insolvent insurer other than this State.

21 association also has the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another  
22 state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which  the association  is or 
23 may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person  or property  against whom the 
24 association may  have rights through  subrogation or otherwise.
25 9.  Subrogation rights.  Any person receiving benefits under this chapter is deemed 
26 to have  assigned that person's rights under, and any causes of action against  any person 
27 for losses  arising  under, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or 
28 contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter 
29 whether the benefits are payments of or on account  of contractual obligations, 
30 continuation of coverage  or provision of substitute or alternative  coverages.  The 
31 association may require  an assignment to it of these rights  and cause of action  by any 
32 payee, policy or contract  owner, beneficiary, insured, enrollee or annuitant  as a condition 
33 precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred by this chapter upon that 
34 person.  The association is subrogated to these rights against  the assets of any impaired or 
35 insolvent insurer.
36 The subrogation rights of the association under  this subsection must have  the same 
37 priority against  the assets  of the impaired  or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the 
38 person entitled to receive benefits  under this chapter.
39 In addition, the association has all common  law rights of subrogation  and any other  
40 equitable or legal  remedy that would have been available  to the impaired or insolvent 
41 insurer or owner, beneficiary, insured,  enrollee or payee of a policy or contract with 
42 respect to the policy or contract, including without limitation, in the case of a structured 
43 settlement annuity,  any rights of the owner,  beneficiary or payee  of the annuity, to the 
44 extent of benefits received pursuant to this chapter, against a person originally  or by 
Page 10 - 128LR2896(01)-11 succession responsible for the losses  arising  from the personal  injury relating to the 
2 annuity or payment therefor, excepting  any such person responsible  solely by reason of 
3 serving as an assignee in respect of a qualified  assignment under  Section 130 of the 
4 federal Internal  Revenue Code.
5 If the provisions  of this subsection are invalid or ineffective  with respect to any person or 
6 claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association  with respect to the related 
7 covered obligations must  be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with 
8 respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or portion thereof covered 
9 by the association.
10 If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered  obligation and a person 
11 recovers amounts as to which the association has rights  as described in this subsection, 
12 the person shall  pay to the association the portion of the recovery  attributable to the 
13 policies or portion thereof  covered  by the association.

19 G.  Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the 
20 superintendent, the powers  of a domestic life or health insurer or health  maintenance

22 contracts other than those  issued to perform the contractual obligations of the 
23 impaired insurer;

35 G.  Except  as otherwise expressly provided, this subsection does not alter or modify 
36 the terms and conditions of the indemnity reinsurance  agreements of an insolvent 
37 insurer.  This subsection may not be construed to abrogate or limit any rights of any 
38 reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement.  This 
39 subsection may not be construed  to give a policy owner, contract owner, enrollee, 
40 certificate holder or beneficiary an independent cause  of action against an indemnity 
41 reinsurer that is not otherwise  set forth in the indemnity reinsurance agreement.
Page 11 - 128LR2896(01)-11 Sec. 24.  24-A  MRSA §4608,  sub-§16, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 346, §6 and 
2 affected by §16,  is amended  to read:
3 16.  Issuance of substitute coverage.   In carrying out its duties in connection with 
4 guaranteeing, assuming, reissuing or reinsuring  policies or contracts under  this section,  
5 the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute 
6 coverage for a policy or contract that provides  an interest rate, crediting rate or similar  
7 factor determined by use of an index or other external  reference stated in the policy or 
8 contract employed in calculating returns or changes  in value by issuing  an alternative 
9 policy or contract in accordance with this subsection.
10 A.  In lieu of the index or other external reference provided  for in the original  policy 
11 or contract, the  alternative policy or  contract must  provide  for:
12 (1)  A fixed interest rate;
13 (2)  Payment or dividends with minimum  guarantees; or
14 (3)  A different method for calculating interest or  changes  in value.
15 B.  There may not be a requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or 
16 other exclusion that  would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract.
17 C.  The alternative policy  or contract must  be substantially similar to the replaced 
18 policy or contract in all  other  material terms.
19 Sec. 25.  24-A MRSA §4609,  sub-§3-A, as enacted  by PL 2005, c. 346, §7 and 
20 affected by §16,  is amended  to read:
21 3-A.  Determination of  assessments.  Assessments must  be determined as follows:
22 A.  The amount of any Class A assessment,  as described in subsection 2-A, for each 
23 account must  be determined by the board  of directors and may be authorized and 
24 called on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis.  The amount of any Class B assessment,  as 
25 described in subsection 2-A, must  be allocated for assessment purposes among  the 
26 accounts pursuant to an allocation formula that may be based on the premiums  or 
27 reserves of the impaired or insolvent  insurer or any other standard  determined by the 
28 board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable  under the circumstances.   This 
29 paragraph may not be a factor  in the determination  as to whether the protection 
30 provided by laws for residents  of this State  by the domiciliary jurisdiction of a 
31 foreign or alien insurer is or is not substantially similar to the protection provided by 
32 this chapter  for residents  of other states If pro rata, it must be allocated in the same 
33 proportions as a Class  B assessment under paragraph C, and the board has the power 
34 to credit it against future Class B  assessments .
35 B.  Class A assessments, as described in subsection  2-A, against member  insurers  for 
36 each account must be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this 
37 State by each assessed  member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each 
38 account  for the calendar year for which  information is available  preceding the year in 
39 which the insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an 
40 impaired insurer,  the calendar  year for which information  is available preceding the 
Page 12 - 128LR2896(01)-11 year in which the insurer became impaired  bears  to premiums received on business  in 
2 this State for the calendar year by all  assessed  member insurers.
3 C.  Class B assessments, as described in subsection 2-A, against  member  insurers  for 
4 each account must be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this 
5 State by each assessed  member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each 
6 account for the calendar year for which information is available preceding the year in 
7 which the insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an 
8 impaired insurer,  the calendar  year for which information  is available preceding the 
9 year in which the insurer became impaired  bears  to premiums received on business  in 
10 this State  for the calendar year by all assessed member  insurers must be allocated as 
11 follows.
12 (1)  Except  for assessments  related to long-term care insurance  that are subject to 
13 allocation under subparagraph (2), the amount of the assessment must be 
14 allocated among  the accounts pursuant to an allocation  formula that may be based 
15 on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent  insurer or any other  
16 standard determined by the board of directors  in its sole discretion  as being fair 
17 and reasonable  under the circumstances.
18 (2)  The amount of any Class B assessment for liabilities arising out of long-term  
19 care insurance written by the impaired  or insolvent insurer, if the impairment or 
20 insolvency is declared on or after July 1, 2018, must  be allocated among the 
21 accounts according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and 
22 approved by the superintendent.  The methodology  must provide  for 50% of the 
23 assessment to be allocated to member  insurers  that are health insurers  and 50% to 
24 be allocated to member insurers that are  life and annuity  insurers.
25 (3)  All Class  B assessments must be allocated among member insurers  within 
26 each account in the proportion that the premiums  received by each assessed 
27 member insurer, on business in this State covered by the account,  bears to 
28 premiums received on such business by all assessed  member insurers, for the 
29 most recent  calendar year for which information is available preceding the year in 
30 which the insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect 
31 to an impaired insurer,  preceding the  year  in which  the insurer became impaired.
32 (4)  Health maintenance organizations are not subject  to Class B assessments 
33 arising out of  impairments  or insolvencies declared before July 1, 2018.
34 D.  Assessments for funds to meet  the requirements  of the association  with respect to 
35 an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to 
36 implement the purposes of this chapter.  Classification of assessments under  
37 subsection 2-A and computation of assessments under this paragraph must be made  
38 with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not 
39 always be possible.
40 E.  This subsection may not be a factor in determining whether  the protection 
41 provided by laws for residents  of this State  by the domiciliary jurisdiction of a 
42 foreign or alien insurer is substantially similar  to the protection provided  by this 
43 chapter for residents  of other states.

2 to read:

4 suspend or revoke, after notice  and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact 
5 insurance business in this State of any member  insurer  which that fails to pay an

7 suspension or revocation, any member  insurer which that fails to pay an assessment when  
8 due or fails to comply with the plan of operation may be punished by a fine not to exceed 
9 the greater of  5% of the unpaid assessment per month or $100 per month.

14 responsibilities of the superintendent regarding the financial condition of member 
15 insurers and companies seeking admission to transact  insurance or health  maintenance 
16 organization business  in this State.
17 3.  Action by board of directors.  The board of directors, upon majority  ballot vote, 
18 shall:
19 A.  Notify  the superintendent of any information  indicating that any member insurer 
20 may be an impaired  or insolvent insurer;
21 B.  Make reports and recommendations  to the superintendent upon any matter  
22 germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member  
23 insurer or germane to the solvency of any company seeking to do an insurance or 
24 health maintenance organization business in this State.  These  reports  and 
25 recommendations must  be treated as confidential by the superintendent; and

30 A.  Prior to the termination of any liquidation,  rehabilitation or conservation 
31 proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective 
32 parties, including the association,  the shareholders  and, policy owners, contract 
33 owners, certificate holders  and enrollees of the impaired or insolvent insurer and any 
34 other party with a bona  fide interest, in making  an equitable distribution of the 
35 ownership rights of the impaired  or insolvent insurer.  In such a determination, 
36 consideration must be given to the welfare of the policy owners, contract owners, 
37 certificate holders and enrollees of the continuing or  successor insurer.
38 Sec. 29.  24-A MRSA §4620, first ¶, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 346, §14 and 
39 affected by §16,  is amended  to read:
Page 14 - 128LR2896(01)-11 A person, including an a member insurer  or an agent or affiliate of an a member 
2 insurer, may not make, publish, disseminate, circulate  or place before the public or cause 
3 directly or indirectly to be made,  published,  disseminated, circulated or placed before the 
4 public in any newspaper, magazine or publication or in the form of a notice, circular,  
5 pamphlet, letter or poster or over any radio  station or television station or in any other  
6 way any advertisement, announcement or statement, written or oral, that uses the

12 2-A.  Insurers not subject to premium tax.  A member insurer that is not subject to 
13 premium taxation  may take the credit allowed under subsection 1 against  its income tax 
14 liability to this State.  A member insurer that is exempt from both premium  taxation  and 
15 income taxation  in this State  may recoup  its assessments by a surcharge on its premiums 
16 in an amount reasonably calculated to recoup  the assessments over a reasonable period of 
17 time, as approved by the superintendent.  Amounts recouped are not considered 
18 premiums for any other purpose, including medical loss ratio calculations and 
19 premium- based assessments.  If a member  insurer collects excess surcharges, the insurer 
20 shall remit the excess amount to the association, and the excess amount must be applied 
21 to reduce  future  assessments  in the  appropriate  account.
22 SUMMARY
23 This bill amends the Maine Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association  Act to 
24 incorporate changes adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 
25 its 2017 amendments  to its Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act.  
26 Under the bill, for insolvencies  and impairments  occurring  on and after July 1, 2018, 
27 health maintenance organizations are made members of the association and assessments 
28 arising out of long-term care insurance business,  which are currently allocated entirely  to 
29 the health  insurance account, are divided equally between the life and health insurance  
30 industries.  The bill also makes various conforming amendments and technical 
31 corrections to the Maine Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act and the 
32 Insurance Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law.
33 The bill allows an insurer that is a member of the Maine Life and Health Insurance  
34 Guaranty Association and is not subject to premium taxation  to take the tax credit for 
35 certain assessments  of the association against its income tax liability to this State.  An 
36 insurer that is a member of the association and is exempt  from both premium taxation  and 
37 income taxation in this State may recoup  these  assessments by a surcharge  on its 
38 premiums in an amount reasonably calculated to recoup  these  assessments over a 
39 reasonable period of time, as approved by the  Superintendent of Insurance.
