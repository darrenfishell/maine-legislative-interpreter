COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/t" to S.P. 553, L.D. 1575 
1 breaks of shorter duration to be exempted from the 30-minute rest break requirement only 
2 if the employees are completely relieved of duty during the frequent paid breaks; 
3 5. It eliminates the portions of the bill regarding exemptions to mandatory overtime 
4 pay for certain salaried employees and automobile mechanics, automobile parts clerks 
5 and automobile service writers; 
6 6. It eliminates the provision in the bill that allows a salaried employee to be paid on 
7 a monthly basis; 
8 7. It eliminates the requirement in the bill that an employer preserve wage records 
9 for 3 years; 
10 8. It changes the provision in the bill that specifies that when the terms of 
11 employment or the employer's established practice includes provisions for paid vacations, 
12 vacation pay on cessation of employment has the same status as wages earned; 
13 9. It eliminates the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements 
14 in the bill for domestic service workers employed to provide companionship services; 
15 10. It eliminates the provisions in the bill relating to the definition of "tip" and that 
16 make a mandatory service charge the property of the employer and not the service 
17 employee; and 
18 11. It eliminates the provision in the bill that requires the Department of Labor, 
19 Bureau of Labor Standards to conduct a survey every 3 years to determine the prevailing 
20 hourly wage and benefits rate in the construction industry, instead of annually under 
21 current law. 
22 This amendment also makes changes to the bill to provide further clarity regarding 
23 the current exemption from overtime contained in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, 
24 section 664, subsection 3, paragraph F relating to work in the distribution of agricultural 
25 produce, meat and fish products and perishable foods. The bill and the cmrent 
26 amendment are specifically intended to correct a perceived ambiguity identified by the 
27 United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in O'Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy, 851 
28 F.3d 69 (2017). The amendment attempts to clarify current law by using semicolons to 
29 separate the applicable categories of work to which the exemption applies, and by 
30 changing the term "distribution" to "distributing" to conform to the grammatical 
31 convention of parallel usage by matching the gerund form of the other activities listed in 
32 the exemption, with the intent that work done in the distribution of, or distributing of, 
33 agricultural produce, meat and fish products and perishable foods is exempt from the 
34 overtime requirements of Title 26, section 664. The amendment also adds a retroactivity 
35 clause, applying the changes made to Title 26, section 664, subsection 3, paragraph F 
36 retroactively to September 29, 1995. This retroactivity applies to pending cases except, 
3 7 in deference to the authority of the judiciary to redress disputes, for cases pending on 
3 8 March 12, 2017. The Legislature does not intend for any retroactive change to the 
39 overtime requirements for egg processing facilities enacted by Public Law 2011, chapter 
40 681.
