Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph a re limited to the categories of 18

remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 24 
for service. A noncitizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 25 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 26 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 27 
through a state -funded program unless that noncitizen is:  28
