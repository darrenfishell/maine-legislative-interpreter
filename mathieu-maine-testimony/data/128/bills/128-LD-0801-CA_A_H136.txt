STATE OF MAINE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 581, L.D. 801, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
a Physical Therapist To Administer Certain Coagulation Tests in a Patient's Home" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the need for home care medical services is rapidly increasing as Maine's 
population ages and the prevalence of chronic conditions increases; and 
Whereas, providing health services in the home keeps people out of more costly 
institutional settings and allows people to live at home for as long as it is safe and 
practical for them to do so; and 
Whereas, home health care services are provided by collaborative teams of nurses, 
therapists, aides and others and the industry is facing critical workforce challenges; and 
Whereas, physical therapists who are already visiting patients in their homes have 
more than adequate education to perform finger stick blood tests to assess blood clotting 
levels, and allowing them to perform these tests will save the expense of sending nurses 
to the patients' homes to perfonn these tasks; and 
Whereas, delaying the effective date of this bill will add to the financial and 
workforce challenges faced by the home health care industry; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill in section 1 in the first paragraph in the last line (page 1, line 6 in 
L.D.) by inserting after the following: "that person." the following: 'If a person licensed 
as a physical therapist performs a finger stick blood test pursuant to this section, that

person shall communicate the test results to the prescribing health care practitioner. Only 
the health care practitioner may interpret the test results, determine whether a change is 
needed in the person's plan of care and make decisions with respect to medication 
adjustments.' 
Amend the bill by insetting at the end before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment adds an emergency preamble and adds to the provisions of the bill 
by clarifying that a licensed physical therapist must communicate the results of a finger 
stick blood test to a health care practitioner, who will interpret the test results, determine 
whether a change is needed in the person's plan of care and make decisions with respect 
to medication adjustments.
