 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  5 MRSA §7070, sub -§2, ¶E, as amended by PL 1997, c. 770, §1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
E.  Except as provided in section 7070 -A, complaints, charges or accusations of 4 
misconduct, repl ies to those complaints, charges or accusations and any other 5 
information or materials that may result in disciplinary action.  If disciplinary action 6 
is taken, the final written decision relating to that action is no longer confidential after 7 
the decision  is completed if it imposes or upholds discipline.  If an arbitrator 8 
completely overturns or removes disciplinary action from an employee personnel file, 9 
the final written decision is public except that the employee's name must be deleted 10 
from the final wr itten decision and kept confidential.  If the employee whose name 11 
was deleted from the final written decision discloses that the employee is the person 12 
who is the subject of the final written decision, the entire final written report, with 13 
regard to that e mployee, is public.  14 
For purposes of this paragraph, "final written decision" means:  15 
(1)  The final written administrative decision that is not appealed pursuant to a 16 
grievance arbitration procedure; or  17 
(2)  If the final written administrative decision is a ppealed to arbitration, the final 18 
written decision of a neutral arbitrator.  19 
A final written administrative decision that is appealed to arbitration is no longer  20 
confidential 120 days after a written request for the decision is made to the employer 21 
if the  until a  final written decision of the neutral arbitrator is not issued and released 22 
before the expiration of the 120 days ; 23 
SUMMARY  24 
Current law requires that the final written decision of a state executive branch or 25 
legislative branch employer relating to di sciplinary action of an employee that is appealed 26 
to an arbitrator be made public when the arbitrator issues a final written decision on the 27 
matter or within 120 days after a written request for the decision is made to the employer, 28 
whichever is earlier.  This bill changes the law to making the employer's final written 29 
decision relating to disciplinary action of the employee public upon the issuance and 30 
release of the arbitrator's written decision on the matter, regardless of the time frame in 31 
which the arb itrator's decision is issued and released.  32
