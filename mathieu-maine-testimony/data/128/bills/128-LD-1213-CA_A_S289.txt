An Act To Protect Taxpayers in the Privatization of State Services 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 'b:..' (S ·..Jeq'\ 
Committee: State and Local Government 2.) 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential cmTent biennium savings -General Fund 
This bill will increase the workload of the Department of the Attorney General, the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services and any department or agency involved in a privatization contract. The amount of additional 
General Fund appropriations required to support this increase cannot be estimated at this time and will depend, in 
part, on the number and complexity of contracts processed. 
To the extent that this bill leads to different decisions related to privatization contracts that exceed $500,000, there 
may be a fiscal impact. The bill requires any such contracts to cost less than the estimated cost of regular agency 
employees providing the subject services in the most cost-efficient manner. The employing agency's written analysis 
of the contract costs must include any transition costs from public to private operation, any additional unemployment 
and retirement benefits and any costs of monitoring or administering contract perfonnance. While the potential for 
savings exists, no prediction can be made of the number of instances going forward, nor of the magnitude of savings 
in such instances, where the required cost comparisons will result in savings to state agencies.
