2 ineligible or disqualified from receiving general assistance. The amendment also makes 
3 an applicant for general assistance who voluntarily abandons or refuses to use an 
4 available resource without just cause ineligible to receive general assistance to replace the 
5 abandoned or refused resource for a period of 120 days from the date the applicant 
6 abandons or refuses the resource. It defines "available resource" as a resource that is 
7 immediately available or can be secured without delay. It also makes an applicant who 
8 forfeits an available resource due to fraud, misrepresentation or intentional violation of or 
9 refusal to comply with rules without just cause ineligible to receive general assistance to 
10 replace the forfeited resource for the duration of a sanction imposed on the applicant for 
11 any of these actions or 120 days, whichever is greater. The amendment also identifies

An Act To Improve General Assistance Reimbursements 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment C," l S-4 / 6) 
Committee: Health and Human Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential Cllffent biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential current biennium savings -General Fund 
This bill defines homelessness and establishes it as an emergency for the purposes of being granted General 
Assistance (GA), assuming appgcant is not otherwise ineligible or disqualtfied from receiving GA. By being deemed 
an emergency, municipalities would be allowed to go over the nonnal monthly cap on housing expenditures in GA. 
This will potentially increase assistance payments made by municipalities and increase amounts reimbursed to 
municipalities by the Depaiiment of Health and Human Services. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not 
possible because recipient data related to number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number of 
recipients who return and the frequency of emergency status resides at the municipal level and varies over time. 
Additionally, this bill makes an applicant for general assistance who voluntarily abandons or refuses to use an 
available resource without just cause ineligible to receive general assistai1ce to replace the abandoned or refused 
resource for a period of 120 days. This will potentially reduce assistance payments made by municipalities and reduce 
amounts reimbursed to municipalities by the Department of Health and Human Services. The potential savings to the 
department is not expected to be significant because the frequency of refusing or abandoning resources is expected to 
be very small, the municipalities abilty to identify abandoned or refused resources is unknown and recipients typically 
do not stay in the program, having to reapply each month they seek help. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact 
is not possible because recipient data related to number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, 
number of recipients who return and the frequency of refusal of resources resides at the municipal level and varies 
over time.
