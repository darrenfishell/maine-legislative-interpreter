Woodland Pulp LLC or its successors are prevented from doing so by an unforeseen 
extraordinary event. The agreement must ensure that Woodland Pulp LLC and its 
successors operate and maintain the facility in accordance with the agreement required 
under this section at no cost to the State for a period of 3 0 years from the date the State

SUMMARY 
This amendment provides that the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, 
rather than the Department of Administrative and Financial Services as provided in the 
resolve, may assume ownership of the dam and water storage project known as the Forest 
City Project, together with associated flowage rights, from Woodland Pulp LLC if certain 
contingencies are met. The contingencies that must be satisfied before the department is 
authorized to assume ownership of the Forest City Project are that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission must determine that, once ownership is transferred, the State will 
not be subject to a licensing requirement by that commission and that the State must enter 
into an agreement with Woodland Pulp LLC that provides that Woodland Pulp LLC and 
its successors will maintain and operate the Forest City Project, at the direction of the 
State and with certain limited exceptions, for a period of 30 years from the date of the 
transfer at no cost to the State. The amendment also removes the emergency preamble 
and emergency clause.

Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The transfer of ownership of the dam and water storage project known as the Foresty City Project to the Depaiiment 
of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IF & W) is contingent on an agreement with current owner Woodland Pulp LLC to 
maintain and operate the Facility for a period of 30 years at no cost to the State. During that period any costs to IF&W 
are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The bill does not indicate what 
will happen after 30 years and the fiscal note assumes the State's ownership would mean it would assume all costs of 
operation and maintenance, which have been estimated between $55,000 and $80,000 arurnally.
