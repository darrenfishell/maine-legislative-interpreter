Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill defines homelessness and establishes it as an emergency for the purposes of being granted General 
Assistance (GA), assuming applicant is not otherwise ineligible or disqualified from receiving GA. By being deemed 
an emergency, municipalities would be allowed to go over the normal monthly cap on housing expenditures in GA. 
This will potentially increase assistance payments made by municipalities and increase amounts reimbursed to 
municipalities by the Department of Health and Human Services. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not 
possible because recipient data related to number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number of 
recipients who return and the frequency of emergency status resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
