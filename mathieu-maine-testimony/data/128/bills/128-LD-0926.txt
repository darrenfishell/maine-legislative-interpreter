 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง15689, sub -ยง14 is enacted to read:  2 
14.  Adjustment for highly funded schools.   Beginning in fiscal year 2018 -19, and 3 
in each subsequent fiscal year, the commissioner shall de crease the state share of the total 4 
allocation to a highly funded school in accordance with this subsection.  For purposes of 5 
this subsection, "highly funded school" means a school administrative unit whose total 6 
spending on education programs and services  in the most recent year for which data is 7 
available exceeded 108% of the total cost of the components of essential programs and 8 
services for that school administrative unit in that year, excluding any adjustment made 9 
under this subsection.  "Highly funded  school" does not include a school administrative 10 
unit with a median family income below $40,000, as determined by the commissioner 11 
using the most recent census data.  The commissioner shall decrease the state share of the 12 
total allocation to a highly fund ed school by an amount equal to the difference between 13 
108% of the total cost of the components of essential programs and services for that 14 
school administrative unit in the previous fiscal year and the amount spent by the school 15 
administrative unit on edu cation programs and services in that previous fiscal year.  16

previous fiscal year.  28
