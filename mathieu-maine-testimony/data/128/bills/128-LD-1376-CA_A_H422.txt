2,000 hours of documented supervised practice in alcohol and drug counseling,

SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provisions of the bill directing the Department of 
Health and Human Services to increase certain MaineCare reimbursement rates and 
directing the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, State Board of 
Alcohol and Drug Counselors to change the processes for licensing applications and 
examinations. 
The amendment also restores the requirements in current law that an applicant for 
licensure as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor must complete 4,000 hours of practice 
in alcohol and drug counseling if the applicant possesses an associate or bachelor's degree 
from an approved program or must complete 2,000 hours of practice in alcohol and drug 
counseling if the applicant possesses a master's degree from an approved program. The 
amendment creates exceptions reducing the clinical practice hour requirements for 
applicants who complete a specified number of credit hours in addiction counseling 
course work in the course of obtaining a bachelor's degree or master's degree from an 
approved program.
