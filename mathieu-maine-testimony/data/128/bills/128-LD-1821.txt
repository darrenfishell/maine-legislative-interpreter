23 regarding specific  guidance on how a member of the public can use the law to be a better  
24 informed and active  participant in open government.  To meet  the requirements of this

14 SUMMARY
15 Current law requires officials elected to certain positions to complete training on the 
16 requirements of the Freedom of Access  Act but does not require officials appointed to 
17 those positions to complete that training.  This bill implements  the recommendation  of the 
18 Right To Know  Advisory Committee that appointed officials also be required  to complete 
19 the training.
