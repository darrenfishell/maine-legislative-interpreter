SUMMARY  33 
This bill directs the Treasurer of State to establish education savings accounts that 34 
may be used by the parents or legal guardians of children to pay for the education of their 35 
children outside  of the public school system.  The funding for these savings accounts 36 
would come from shifting 90% of the essential programs and services funding that would 37 
otherwise be provided by the State and the school administrative unit for each child into a 38 
savings  account.  The bill specifies what educational expenditures are permitted and 39 
provides for review of spending from the accounts.  40
