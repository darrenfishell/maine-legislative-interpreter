Contributions under this subsection become due and must be paid by each employer to 18

case it must be increased to one cent.  A person who is self -employed may receive 22 
benefits from the  fund upon application to the bureau and payment to the bureau of a 23 
contribution in the amount determined by the bureau under subsection 3.  24

the same basis as wages or earnings are paid. A copy of the wage information must be 42

this subsection.  If an employer provides a family medical leave benefit to an employee 12

subsection, the bureau shall pay to the employer the benefit to which the employee is 14 
entitled under this subsection.  15

SUMMARY  9 
This bill creates a paid family medical leave program, patterned after the unpaid 10 
family medical leave program existing in current law but requiring a  contribution from an 11 
eligible employee, or a self -employed person on a voluntary basis, of no more than 0.5% 12 
of the employee's or self -employed person's wages or earnings.  The program requires 13 
employers to deduct the contributions from employee paychecks  and for the employers 14 
and self -employed persons to submit contributions to the Department of Labor, Bureau of 15 
Unemployment Compensation, which is charged with administering the program. The 16 
program pays benefits of up to 66% of an employee's wages or self -employed person's 17 
earnings capped at the same maximum amount as unemployment benefits for leave taken 18 
by the employee or self -employed person for various family -related medical issues. This 19 
bill makes participation optional for employers that employ fewer  than 15 employees.  20 
This bill also directs the Department of Labor to develop an implementation plan dealing 21 
with staffing, technology, start -up expense, rulemaking and scheduling to begin the 22 
program on its effective date of October 1, 2019.  23
