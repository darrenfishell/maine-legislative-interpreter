128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "14,, to H.P. 169, L.D. 213, Bill, "An Act To 
Provide Funds for Access for Veterans Seeking Health Care" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section I and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. Commissioner of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management 
to distribute funds to cover the costs of United States Department of State 
passport card. Upon the effective date of this Act and until 90 days following the date 
upon which the State conforms with the requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 
2005 for the issuance of driver's licenses and state identification cards, the Commissioner 
of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, or the commissioner's designee, shall 
provide funds to pay for the fee for a United States Department of State passport card for 
a veteran who: 
1. Is a resident of the State; 
2. Demonstrates the need to access federal military installations located in New 
Hampshire for medical services provided at United States Veterans Administration health 
care facilities; 
3. Does not have the required photographic identification to access a federal military 
installation; and 
4. Demonstrates significant financial hardship, making the fee for a passport card 
cost-prohibitive. 
The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, is not required to provide funds 
to a veteran to pay the fee for a passport if the funds appropriated in section 2 of this Act 
have been exhausted. If any funds appropriated under section 2 remain 90 days following 
the date upon which the State conforms with the requirements of the federal REAL ID 
Act of 2005, those funds must be used for providing financial assistance to veterans and 
dependents of veterans as prescribed by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 37-B, section 
505.

This amendment directs the Commissioner 
of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
Management or the commissioner's designee to pay for the fee charged for a passport 
card issued by the United States Department of State for a veteran who demonstrates a 
need to access federal military installations located in New Hampshire for medical 
services provided by the United States Veterans Administration and does not have the 
required photographic identification required. Unlike the bill, which provides an 
appropriation to pay for the costs of passports, the amendment provides funding for 
passport cards. The amendment reduces the appropriation proposed in the bill from 
$45,000 to $15,000. Under the amendment, if any funds appropriated for passport cards 
remain unspent 90 days following the date upon which the State conforms with the 
requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, that balance must be used to provide 
financial assistance to veterans and dependents of veterans as prescribed by the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 37-B, section 505.
