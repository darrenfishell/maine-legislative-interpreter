effectively serve its citizens; and

government meetings is a high priority for the Stat e of Maine; and

now assembled in the Second Regular Session, on beh alf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to recognize Sunshine Week during the w eek of March 11-17, 2018 and confirm the 
basic principles of an open and accessible governme nt in a free society and urge all citizens to 
join in this observance.
