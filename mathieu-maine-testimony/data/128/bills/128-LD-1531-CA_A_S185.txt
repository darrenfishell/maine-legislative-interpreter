This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $250,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $700,000 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program within the Department of Education. Of those 
amounts, $250, 000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2017-18 and fiscal year 2018-19 for exploratory programs to benefit 
students of science, technology, computer science, engineering and math. Additionally, $450,000 in fiscal year 2018-
19 is appropriated for autism identification and intervention services. Funding for the pilot programs is also included 
in LD 390, the Governor's proposed budget for the 2018-2019 biennium at $250,000 for both fiscal year 2017-18 and 
2018-19 and funding of $500,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 is included for autism identification and intervention services. 
The fiscal impacts of other proposals in this legislation, including using the same funding methodology for the Maine 
School for Marine Science, Technology, Transportation and Engineering as the methodology established for public 
charter schools that are authorized by the Maine Charter School Commission; eliminating the declining enrollment 
adjustment in the calculation of essential program and services; and repealing the authority of the Commissioner of 
Education to spend and disburse funds for school improvement and support, implementation of performance 
evaluation and professional growth systems and learning results implementation, assessment and accountability are 
also reflected in the calculation of the total cost of funding public education from kindergarten to grade 12 and the 
State's contribution to that cost proposed in the Governor's 2018-2019 biennial budget. The estimated fiscal impact of 
this legislation may need to be adjusted based on final legislative actions on the biennial budget.
