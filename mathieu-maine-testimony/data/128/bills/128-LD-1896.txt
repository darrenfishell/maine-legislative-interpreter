Page 1 - 128LR2966(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3152,  sub-§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. F, §§2 to 
3 4, is further amended to read:
4 1.  Increased efficiency.  The Legislature declares  and finds that improvements in 
5 transmission and distribution utility rate design and related regulatory programs  have 
6 great potential for reducing the cost of electric  utility  services to consumers,  for 
7 encouraging energy conservation and efficient use of existing facilities and for 
8 minimizing the need  for expensive new electric transmission capacity.  It is the purpose  
9 of this chapter to:
10 A.  Require  the commission to relate transmission and distribution rates  more closely  
11 to the costs  of providing transmission and distribution  service ., including promoting 
12 the recovery of fixed transmission and distribution  utility costs through  fixed 
13 customer charges to the  maximum extent practicable and economically efficient; 
14 C.  Require  the commission to consider the ability of low-income residential 
15 customers to pay in full for electric  services  as transmission and distribution rates are 
16 redesigned consistent with these policies; and
17 D.  Require the commission to set rates, including  transmission and distribution  rates 
18 that vary by time of day and season and by other relevant cost drivers, to the extent 
19 practicable to achieve economic efficiency .; and
20 E.  Require the commission to examine and adopt appropriate changes to 
21 transmission and distribution utility rate class designations that would improve equity 
22 and economic efficiency.
23 Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3153-A,  sub-§1, as corrected  by RR 2009, c. 2, §103, is 
24 amended to read:
25 1.  Proposals and programs developed.  The commission, as it determines 
26 appropriate, shall order  investor-owned transmission and distribution  utilities to develop  
27 and submit to the commission  for approval  by January 1, 2019 specific rate design  
28 proposals and related programs  for implementing energy conservation and energy 
29 efficiency techniques and innovations , either  in conjunction with or independent of any 
30 rate-making proceeding  pending before the commission.  The proposals, as the 
31 commission determines, must be designed  to encourage energy conservation, minimize 
32 the need for new transmission  and distribution  capacity, minimize costs of transmission 
33 and distribution  service to consumers improve equity among customers , minimize  
34 transmission and distribution  rates over the long term or short term and take into account 
35 the needs of low-income  customers.  In approving a proposal under  this section, the 
36 commission shall give equivalent consideration to the goals of minimizing costs and 
37 minimizing transmission and distribution rates to consumers.   Proposals must include,  but 
38 are not limited to, proposals that  provide for the development  and implementation  of:
39 A.  Load management techniques, including proposals for implementing cost-
40 effective load control and other smart grid technologies and programs, such as 
Page 2 - 128LR2966(01)-11 dispatchable load reduction technologies and distributed generation, designed to 
2 optimize distribution and  transmission  load profiles;
3 B.  Rates that reflect marginal costs of services at different voltages,  times of day or, 
4 seasons of the year or other relevant cost drivers, including short-run  and long-run 
5 marginal costs associated  with the construction of new transmission  and distribution 
6 facilities;
7 D.  Rates or other regulatory  policies  that encourage maintain transmission and 
8 distribution utility system reliability;
9 E.  Transmission and distribution  utility  financing or subsidization of capital 
10 improvements undertaken by ratepayers to conserve optimize electricity used usage 
11 by the ratepayers in the future.   This paragraph applies  to future programs for utility 
12 financing of energy conservation or load management as long as the goal of such 
13 programs is to economically defer  or eliminate  the need for transmission and 
14 distribution plant upgrades. In addition to programs undertaken pursuant to this 
15 paragraph, programs may be undertaken pursuant  to section 10110 to achieve goals 
16 other than that  identified  in this paragraph;
17 F.  As defined by the commission by rule, cost-effective  conversions  of electric space 
18 heat systems to systems relying on other fuels and other techniques for enabling  
19 homeowners and tenants  to replace  on-peak,  winter  period electric  usage  with less 
20 expensive sources of heat;
21 G.  Rates or bill payment assistance programs for residential customers  who have  
22 been certified eligible for state or federal fuel assistance that take into account the 
23 difficulty these customers  have paying in full for electric service or that target 
24 assistance to these  customers in the most efficient  manner, taking into account the 
25 necessity of maintaining electric service; and
26 H.  Rates  or programs that allow encourage incremental use or maintenance of 
27 existing use when those rates  uses serve  to minimize rate levels  for all transmission 
28 and distribution customers.   In approving any proposal for rates or programs that 
29 allow encourage incremental use or maintenance  of existing use, the commission 
30 shall seek to ensure that rates  for  all customer classes will be lower than they would 
31 have been had the  commission not approved  the proposal.
32 Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3154, sub-§1,  as amended by PL 1999, c. 398, Pt. A, §59 
33 and affected by §§104 and  105,  is further amended to read:
34 1.  Rate design and conservation improvements.   The commission shall mandate, 
35 after notice and hearing on the proposed schedule,  a scheduled phasing-in of the 
36 improvements in transmission  and distribution  utility rate design and related  regulatory 
37 programs submitted  and approved under section 3153-A  and is authorized to order  
38 utilities to implement transmission and distribution utility  rate design improvements  
39 approved by the commission on a temporary, pilot and experimental basis, affecting  
40 either a portion or all of any class  of consumers of any utility as the commission may 
41 determine is appropriate to carry out the purposes  of this subchapter, and order other 
42 energy conservation techniques,  programs and innovations relating to transmission and 
43 distribution utility service that, in the commission's judgment, are practicable, just and 
Page 3 - 128LR2966(01)-11 reasonably related to fulfilling the purposes  of this chapter.  In ordering  any rate design 
2 improvements or any other  programs for implementing  energy  conservation efficiency 
3 techniques and innovations referred to in section 3153-A, the commission shall  consider  
4 rate design stability and  shall ensure the revenue requirements of the utility.
5 Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3209, sub-§5  is enacted  to read:
6 5.  Supply rates.  To the extent  cost effective and practicable, the commission shall 
7 implement policies and practices to encourage competitive electricity suppliers to offer  
8 residential and commercial customers electricity supply pricing reflective of real-time 
9 market price  variations.
10 Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§7, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, §3, is 
11 amended to read:
12 7.  Conservation program  fund.  The trust shall  establish a conservation program  
13 fund to be used solely for conservation  programs, except as described in paragraph C and 
14 subsection 10.
15 A.  The commission shall deposit all assessments collected pursuant to this section, 
16 other than funds deposited in the administration fund, into the  program fund.
17 B.  Any interest earned  on funds  in the program fund must be credited to the program  
18 fund.
19 C.  Funds Except for funds targeted for low-income  residential transmission and 
20 distribution customers, funds not spent in any fiscal year remain in the program  fund 
21 to be used for conservation  programs.  Funds targeted for low-income residential 
22 transmission and distribution customers that are not spent within a fiscal  year may,  at 
23 the commission's discretion, be returned to investor-owned transmission and 
24 distribution utilities to offset any bill increases to low-income residential transmission 
25 and distribution  customers as a result of rate design changes that recover fixed  
26 residential transmission and  distribution utility costs through fixed customer  charges.
27 D.  The commission or the trust may apply for and receive grants  from state, federal  
28 and private sources for deposit  in the program fund and also may deposit in the 
29 program fund any grants  or other funds received  by or from any entity with which the 
30 commission or trust has an agreement  or contract  pursuant to this section if the 
31 commission receives  prior  written consent  from the trust that receipt of those funds 
32 would be consistent with the purposes of this section.  If the commission or trust 
33 receives any funds pursuant  to this paragraph,  it shall  establish a separate account 
34 within the program fund to receive the funds and shall keep those funds and any 
35 interest earned on those funds segregated from other funds in the program  fund.
36 Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§10, as amended by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. A, 
37 §24, is further amended to read:
38 10.  Funds held in trust.  All funds collected from  electricity consumers pursuant to 
39 this section are collected under  the authority and for the purposes of this section and are 
40 deemed to be held in trust for the purposes  of benefiting electricity consumers.  In the 
41 event funds are not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years of being  
Page 4 - 128LR2966(01)-11 collected from  consumers, the commission shall  ensure that the value  of those  funds is 
2 returned to consumers.  Funds targeted for low-income residential transmission and 
3 distribution customers pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph B, subparagraph (1) that are 
4 not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years must be returned to low-
5 income residential transmission and distribution  customers.
6 SUMMARY
7 This bill requires  the Public Utilities  Commission  to promote recovery of fixed 
8 transmission and distribution  costs through  fixed customer  costs, to the extent  practicable 
9 and economically  efficient, and to examine and make appropriate changes to transmission 
10 and distribution  utility rate class designations to the extent such changes  would improve 
11 equity and economic efficiency.  The bill further requires the commission to implement 
12 transmission and distribution  rates that vary by time of day and season or other  relevant 
13 cost drivers,  to the extent practicable, to achieve economic efficiency.   The bill requires 
14 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to submit  specific rate design 
15 proposals to the commission  by January  1, 2019 and provides  that such plans must 
16 include proposals  for implementing cost-effective programs and load-control 
17 technologies to optimize  distribution circuit and transmission system load profiles and 
18 rates or programs  that encourage  incremental  usage if such uses would lower  rates for all 
19 customer classes.  The bill removes the requirement that transmission and distribution 
20 utilities' proposals include  cost-effective  conversions  of electric space  heat systems.
21 The bill also removes the requirement that rate design changes implemented  pursuant 
22 to the Maine Revised  Statutes, Title  35-A, section  3153-A be implemented on a 
23 temporary, pilot or experimental basis and requires  the commission to implement  policies  
24 and practices to encourage competitive electricity  providers  to offer residential and 
25 commercial customers supply  prices reflective of real-time  market  price variations.
26 The bill provides that any Efficiency  Maine Trust funds targeted  to low-income  
27 residential transmission  and distribution customers that remain unspent at the end of a 
28 fiscal year may,  at the commission's discretion, be returned to investor-owned 
29 transmission and distribution utilities to offset bill increases  to low-income transmission 
30 and distribution customers  resulting from the bill's rate design changes.  The bill also 
31 provides that Efficiency Maine Trust funds targeted to low-income residential 
32 transmission and distribution  customers that are uncommitted  2 years after having been  
33 collected must  be returned  to those  customers.
