Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to implement the provisions of this 
bill are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. An operator of a cigar lounge 
will be required to obtain a license, increasing licensing revenue by a small amount. 
This bill allows a Cigar Lounge to obtain a Class I, Class II, Class III or Class IV Liquor License from the Bureau of 
Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) if it has received a cigar lounge retail tobacco license from 
DHHS and does not allow persons under 21 years of age on the premises. Any additional costs to BABLO to 
implement the provisions of this bill are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
Additional revenue from the issuance of licenses by BAB LO is expected to result in a minor increase in General Fund 
revenue.
