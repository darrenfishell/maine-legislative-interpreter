The Department of Education has requested and this bill includes General Fund appropriations of $125 ,341 in fiscal 
year,2017-18 and $100,729 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program for one 
Public Service Coordinator I position and related All Other costs associated with establishing and administering a 
program to provide education savings accounts to children with disabilities. 
This legislation requires the Depaitment of Education to deposit 90% of the state subsidy for each child participating 
in the prografo that would otherwise be paid to the child's local school administrative unit (SAU) into a savings 
account established for that child. The bill also provides that a pmtion of the remaining 10% of state subsidy 
attributable to that child not deposited into an education savings account may be used to offset the administrative costs 
to the· Department and the State Controller. It is unclear whether or not this provision will be sufficient to cover the 
annual costs to the Department of Education to administer this program. 
This bill also requires the SAU of the child participating in the program to deposit 90% of its required local 
contribution attributable to that child into the child's education savings ·account. The impact to individual SAU's 
affected by this requirement will depend on the number of students in each SAU that pa1ticipate in the program each 
year. 
This bill also includes a General Fund appropriation of $67,115 in fiscal year 2017-2018 and $91,002 in fiscal year 
2018-19 for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services for one position to manage the education 
savings accounts.
