minimum oash wage paid direotly to a tipped servioe employee and the minimum hourly 
'i'fage established under subseotion 1. £tarting January 1, 2018, and on eaoh January 1st 
thereafter, the minimum oash v,rage paid direotly to a tipped servioe employee must be 
inoreased by an additional $1.00 per hour until it reaohes the same amount as the annually 
adjusted minimum hourly wage established under subseotion 1, exoept that if the 
minimum oash wage paid direotly to a tipped servioe employee is less than $1.00 less 
than the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage, it must be inoreased by that lesser 
amount. An employer who elects to use the tip credit, until it is eliminated under this 
subseotion, must inform the affected employee in advance, as provided for in this 
subsection, and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the minimum 
hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are combined within the established 7-
day workweek. Upon a satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's 
representative that the actual tips received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall 
increase the direct wages by the difference. 
The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 
not be shared with the employer. Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 
bill or that are .charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 
employee. A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 
reimbursement from a credit card company. The employer may not deduct any amount 
from employee tips charged to a credit card, including, but not limited to, service fees 
assessed to the employer in connection with the credit card transaction. 
An employer who elects to use the tip credit must inform the affected employee in 
advance, either orally or in writing, of the following information: 
A. The amount of the direct wage to be paid by the employer to the tipped employee; 
B. The amount of tips to be credited as wages toward the minimum wage; 
C. That the amount of tips to be credited as wages may not exceed the value of the 
tips actually received by the employee; 
D. That all tips received by the affected employee must be retained by the employee, 
except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and 
regularly receive tips in accordance with subsection 2-A; 
E. That the tip credit may not apply to any employee who has not been informed by 
the employer of the provisions for a tip credit; and 
F. If the employer uses a tip pooling arrangement, any required tip pool contribution 
amount from the employee. 
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'
