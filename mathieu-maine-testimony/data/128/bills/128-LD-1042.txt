SUMMARY  16 
Under current law, if a road association is formed for the maintenance of a private 17 
road, private way or bridge,  all owners of land benefitted by that private road, way or 18 
bridge are required to pay a share of the costs incurred for the maintenance of that private 19 
road, way or bridge.  If an owner fails to pay, the owner's share of the costs may be 20 
recovered in a ci vil action, up to a maximum of 1% of the owner's municipal property 21 
valuation.  22 
This bill increases the maximum amount of liability to 2% of the owner's municipal 23 
property valuation.  24
