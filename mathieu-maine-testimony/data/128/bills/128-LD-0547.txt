 the Town of Milo or at a dam on the outlet of Schoodic Lake in Lake View Plantation  or 1

SUMMARY  7 
This bill:  8 
1.  Prohibits a person from altering fish, including smelts, from their natural state 9 
until after a wet measure has been conducted;  10 
2.  Replaces the term "alewives" with the term "river herring" to be more consistent 11 
with Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife usage. The definition of river herring 12 
includes both ale wives and blueback herring; and  13 
3.  Removes several species from the definition of baitfish that do not exist in the 14 
waters of the State, are not commonly used or sold in the State or are found in very 15 
localized areas and should not be used as bait due to the possibility of introduction into 16 
other areas with adverse effects.  17
