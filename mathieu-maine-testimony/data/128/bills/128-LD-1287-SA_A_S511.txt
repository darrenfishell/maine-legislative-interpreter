The amendment delays the effective dates of the bill to extend the income tax credit for dentists who practice in 
underserved areas and increases the number of primary care professionals who may be certified for the primary care 
access credit. The incremental impact of the amendment is to reduce the General Fund revenue loss by $47,040 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and by $82,320 in fiscal year 2018-19, and to reduce the Local Government Fund revenue loss by 
$960 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $1,680 in fiscal year 2018-19. As amended, the bill would decrease General Fund 
revenue by $47,040 in fiscal year 2018-19 and decrease Local Government Fund revenue by $960 in fiscal year 2018-
19.
