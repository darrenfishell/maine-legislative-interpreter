The bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the Depa1iment of Health and Human Services of $16,707 in fiscal 
year 2017-18 for development and testing related to technology changes to the Automated Client Eligibility System. 
Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for the Federal match. 
Additionally, there could be a potential increase to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administrative 
costs for increased electronic benefit transactions. This amount would likely be minor and can be absorbed within the 
existing budget.
