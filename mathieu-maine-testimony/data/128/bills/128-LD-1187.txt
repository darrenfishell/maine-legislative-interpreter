relative.  A relative who has not been designated as a participant under section 4005 -D 12 
may make the request for placement in writing.  In making a decision on the request, the 13 
court shall make placement with a relative a priority for consideration for placement if 14 
that placement is in the best interests of the child and consistent with section 4003.  There 15 
is a rebuttable presumption that placement with a relative is in the best interests of the 16 
child, if such placement does not substantially interfere with reunificati on efforts.  17 
Sec. 3.  22 MRSA §4007, sub -§7 is enacted to read:  18 
7.  Parent's right to hear evidence before testifying.  In any hearing held by the 19
