3 to read:
4 2.  Civil violations.  When a complaint is made to the proper officer of the District

6 infraction, the officer of the District Court shall cause  to be served  upon the person a 
7 Uniform Summons  and Complaint or other  process in such form  and under  such 
8 circumstances as the Supreme Judicial Court shall by rule provide.   The clerk of each 
9 division may accept an admission to a civil violation upon payment of a fine and 
10 surcharge in accordance  with a schedule of violations, fines and surcharges established  by 
11 the Chief Judge, which  the Chief Judge  may  amend.
12 Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §7007, sub-§3, ¶¶A to C, as amended by PL 2015, c. 204, §1, 
13 are further amended to read:
14 A.  A person who violates subsection 1 commits a civil violation traffic infraction for 
15 which a fine  of not less than  $50 and not more than $100 may be  adjudged.
16 B.  A person who violates subsection 1 after having previously violated  subsection 1 
17 commits a civil violation traffic infraction  for which a fine of not less than $250 and 
18 not more  than $500 may be adjudged.
19 C.  A person who violates subsection 1 after having previously violated  subsection 1 
20 2 times commits a civil violation traffic infraction for which a fine of not less than 
21 $750 and not more than $1,000 may be adjudged.
22 SUMMARY
23 This bill permits violations of certain railroad trespass provisions to be handled by the 
24 District Court's  violations bureau in the same  way as traffic infractions are handled by 
25 changing the violations from civil violations to traffic infractions;  under  the bill, a 
26 violator may waive a court appearance and pay a fine for the violation through the 
27 District Court's  violations bureau.  The bill also establishes  the duty of the Chief  Judge  of 
28 the District Court  to establish the level of fines for other civil violations for persons 
29 charged who wish to waive a  court  appearance.
