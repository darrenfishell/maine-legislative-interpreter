2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the people  of the State  of Maine  in November  2016 passed into law the 
4 Marijuana Legalization Act, which  establishes a system of licensing  for the cultivation,  
5 manufacture, testing and retail sale of adult  use marijuana and adult use marijuana 
6 products in the State  and which enables persons 21 years of age or older to legally 
7 acquire, possess and consume adult  use marijuana and adult  use marijuana products and 
8 to cultivate marijuana for personal use; and
9 Whereas, amendments to the Marijuana Legalization  Act are necessary to provide  
10 clarity in the licensing and regulation of adult use marijuana establishments and in the 
11 oversight and enforcement  of the laws regarding the personal use and home  cultivation of 
12 marijuana; and
13 Whereas, to facilitate the timely implementation  of a retail marketplace in the State 
14 for adult  use marijuana  and adult  use marijuana products,  the agencies charged by law 
15 with the implementation, administration and enforcement of the Marijuana Legalization  
16 Act must adopt rules in accordance with that Act and the Legislature must review those  
17 rules in accordance with the Maine Administrative  Procedure Act as soon as is 
18 practicable; and
19 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
20 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
21 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now,

23 SUMMARY
24 This bill, which is an emergency  bill, facilitates the development and administration 
25 of a regulated marketplace in the State for adult  use marijuana and the regulation  of the 
26 personal use of marijuana  and the home cultivation of marijuana for personal  adult use 
27 pursuant to the Marijuana  Legalization Act, as approved  by the voters  at referendum  in 
28 November 2016.
29 PART A
30 This Part repeals the Marijuana Legalization Act, as codified in the Maine Revised 
31 Statutes, Title 7, chapter 417, and recodifies it as the Marijuana Legalization  Act, referred  
32 to in this summary as "the Act," in a new Title 28-B, Adult Use Marijuana, while  
33 retaining the substance  of the original Act with the following changes.
34 1.  The term "adult  use marijuana" is used instead of the term "retail marijuana."
35 2.  It clarifies the distinction between and provides definitions for the terms 
36 "marijuana plant," "mature marijuana plant," "immature marijuana plant" and  "seedling."
Page 69 - 128LR2805(01)-11 3.  It clarifies  that any conduct relating to the possession, cultivation,  manufacture,  
2 testing, consumption, sale or offering  for sale of marijuana or marijuana products that is 
3 not specifically authorized under the Act, pursuant to a license issued under the Act or 
4 pursuant to the Maine  Medical  Use of Marijuana Act is not authorized and that a person 
5 who engages  in such unauthorized conduct is subject to penalties under the Act and any 
6 additional criminal or civil penalties that may be imposed under  other applicable  laws or 
7 rules.
8 4.  It retains the division  of regulatory authority  regarding the regulation of adult use 
9 marijuana enacted as Public Law 2017, chapter 278, whereby  the Department of 
10 Administrative and Financial Services, referred to in this summary as "the department," is 
11 designated as the primary regulatory authority in the implementation, administration  and 
12 enforcement of the Act, with the Department  of Agriculture,  Conservation and Forestry 
13 retaining regulatory  authority concerning  the cultivation, manufacture, testing, packaging 
14 and labeling of adult use marijuana and  adult  use marijuana products.
15 5.  It further  clarifies the roles and authorities, including the respective rule-making 
16 authorities, of the department and the Department  of Agriculture, Conservation and 
17 Forestry in the implementation, administration and enforcement of the Act and provides  
18 for the provisional adoption of major substantive rules pursuant to the Act by each 
19 department and the submission of those  rules to the Legislature for review pursuant  to the 
20 Maine Administrative  Procedure Act  on or  before  December  1, 2018.
21 6.  It requires  the department to implement and administer a tracking system for adult 
22 use marijuana from  immature marijuana  plant  to the point of retail sale, disposal or 
23 destruction.
24 7.  It requires the department to facilitate  the collection and analysis of public health  
25 and safety data  relating to the effects of  the use of marijuana  in the  State.
26 8.  It requires the department to facilitate the development  and implementation  of 
27 programs, initiatives and campaigns focused on increasing the awareness of and 
28 educating the public on health  and safety matters relating to the use of marijuana and 
29 marijuana products.  Such programs, initiatives and campaigns may be funded  with a 
30 portion of the excise tax and sales  tax revenues resulting from  the sale of adult  use 
31 marijuana and adult use  marijuana products.
32 9.  It requires the department to facilitate the development  and implementation  of 
33 programs or initiatives providing enhanced training for criminal justice agencies in the 
34 requirements and enforcement of the Act.  Such programs  and initiatives may be funded 
35 with a portion of the excise tax and sales tax revenues resulting from the sale of adult use 
36 marijuana and adult use  marijuana products.
37 10.  It requires  the department and the Department  of Agriculture, Conservation and 
38 Forestry to submit to the Legislature an annual report, beginning February 15, 2020, 
39 which must  include  specific information and data relating to the regulated market for 
40 adult use marijuana in the State.
Page 70 - 128LR2805(01)-11 11.  It implements a moratorium on the issuance of adult use marijuana social club 
2 licenses until June 1, 2020 but provides  for the regulation  of licensed adult use marijuana 
3 social clubs after  that date.
4 12.  It removes from the former Marijuana  Legalization  Act provisions relating to the 
5 issuance of  occupational  licenses.
6 13.  It clarifies general  licensing  criteria for applicants  seeking to operate  an adult use 
7 marijuana establishment,  which include a 2-year residency requirement and specific 
8 additional licensing  requirements applicable to the licensing of adult use marijuana 
9 cultivation facilities.   It removes  from the former Marijuana Legalization Act provisions 
10 relating to preference in licensure for medical marijuana caregivers  and medical 
11 marijuana dispensaries.  It removes  from  the former Marijuana  Legalization Act the caps 
12 on the number of each  license type that may be issued, except that:
13 A.  It limits the number of marijuana store licenses  in common ownership  to 4 
14 marijuana store licenses, but repeals that  limitation January 1, 2022; and
15 B.  It limits  the number of cultivation facility licenses in common ownership to 3 
16 cultivation facility licenses  not exceeding  a combined licensed plant canopy of 
17 30,000 square feet.
18 14.  It separates  within the Act the state-level and municipal-level licensing  and 
19 approval processes for adult  use marijuana  establishments.  An applicant for a license  to 
20 operate an adult use marijuana establishment must  submit  an application  along  with the 
21 required application fee to the department, which, after review,  conditionally  may 
22 approve the license.  The licensee may then seek municipal authorization from  the 
23 municipality in which  the licensee proposes to operate the marijuana  establishment.   A 
24 municipality, which includes towns, cities and plantations, by adopted  ordinance may 
25 regulate marijuana establishments within the municipality,  including, but not limited to, 
26 through the adoption of:
27 A.  Land use regulations applicable to marijuana  establishments  within the 
28 municipality;
29 B.  Municipal licensing  requirements  applicable to marijuana  establishments within 
30 the municipality that may include the imposition  of municipal approval or license 
31 fees; and
32 C.  Limitations on the number of any type of marijuana establishment  that may be 
33 approved or  licensed to operate within the municipality.
34 A municipality  may not authorize the operation of a marijuana establishment  within the 
35 municipality unless  the legislative body of the municipality has voted  to generally 
36 authorize some or all types of marijuana establishments within the municipality, 
37 including that type of marijuana establishment.  A person that has been issued a 
38 conditional license by the department may not request municipal authorization to operate 
39 a marijuana establishment within a municipality unless the legislative body of the 
40 municipality has voted to generally authorize some or all types of marijuana 
41 establishments within the municipality, including that type of marijuana establishment.   
42 Once the department receives certification of municipal authorization and the applicant  
Page 71 - 128LR2805(01)-11 pays the applicable  license fee and submits any additional  required documentation, the 
2 department must issue an active license,  good for a term of one year from  the date of 
3 issuance.  A licensee may not engage in the cultivation,  manufacture,  testing, sale or 
4 offering for sale of marijuana or marijuana products until the licensee has been  issued an 
5 active license  by the department.
6 15.  It revises and clarifies the application process for issuance and renewal of a state 
7 license to operate an adult  use marijuana establishment, including revision of the 
8 application and  license fees to be imposed by the department  under the Act.
9 16.  It revises the manner in which  cultivation  facilities are to be licensed and 
10 regulated by removing the statewide  limitation  on the total amount of licensed plant 
11 canopy and by authorizing 5 tiers of cultivation facility license  types, the smallest of 
12 which, a tier 1 license, provides for the cultivation of up to 30 mature marijuana plants or 
13 up to 500 square feet of plant canopy and the largest of which, a tier 4 license, provides 
14 for the cultivation of up to 30,000  square feet of plant canopy.  It also creates a nursery 
15 cultivation facility  license tier, which allows for the cultivation  of immature plants, 
16 seedlings and seeds  and the sale of those immature  plants, seedlings  and seeds to other  
17 licensees and to consumers.  A licensee  seeking  renewal  of a tier 4 license may seek 
18 approval from  the department to expand the area of plant canopy authorized under  the 
19 license by 10,000 square feet,  so long as certain  criteria are met.
20 17.  It clarifies operational requirements for each type of adult use marijuana 
21 establishment, including:
22 A.  Providing  for the payment of an excise  tax by cultivation facilities on the adult 
23 use marijuana sold to  other licensees;
24 B.  Providing for the collection and remittance  of a sales tax by marijuana stores and 
25 marijuana social  clubs on adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana products sold 
26 to consumers;
27 C.  Specifying standards for the extraction of marijuana concentrate  by products  
28 manufacturing facilities;
29 D.  Specifying standards  for the tracking  of adult use marijuana  and adult use 
30 marijuana products by each  type of adult  use marijuana establishment;
31 E.  Specifying standards for the sharing of facilities for the cultivation,  manufacturing 
32 or sale of adult  use marijuana and adult  use marijuana products and marijuana and 
33 marijuana products for medical use by a licensee that is also a registered  primary 
34 caregiver or  registered dispensary;
35 F.  Requiring compliance by licensees with applicable packaging,  labeling and health 
36 and safety requirements;
37 G.  Incorporating standards and requirements applicable to testing facilities as 
38 enacted in Public Law 2017, chapter 309;
39 H.  Clarifying sales authorizations and prohibitions applicable to marijuana stores and 
40 marijuana social clubs, including prohibitions on drive-through sales,  sales by use of 
41 a delivery service, sales  by use of an automated vending machine and  Internet sales;
Page 72 - 128LR2805(01)-11 I.  Providing  that the smoking of marijuana  or marijuana products  at a marijuana 
2 social club is prohibited in accordance with state law regarding smoking in public 
3 places and  public areas;  and
4 J.  Prohibiting the employment of any person under 21 years of age by any adult use 
5 marijuana establishment.
6 18.  It clarifies  and expands  upon the standards and requirements  for the testing of 
7 adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana products; the packaging, labeling  and health  
8 and safety  of adult  use marijuana and adult use marijuana products;  and the use of signs, 
9 advertising and marketing relating  to adult use marijuana and adult use marijuana 
10 products.
11 19.  It provides  for the imposition by the department of monetary penalties on a 
12 licensee or suspensions or revocations of a licensee's license for a violation of the Act, in 
13 accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, and limits  the amount of such 
14 monetary penalties imposed to not more than $10,000 per minor license  violation, not 
15 more than $50,000 per major license violation  and not more than $100,000 per major  
16 license violation  affecting public safety.
17 20.  It establishes the Marijuana Advisory Commission for the purpose of conducting 
18 a continuing study of the laws relating to marijuana  and reporting  to the Legislature its 
19 findings and recommendations on an annual basis.
20 21.  It imposes an excise tax on adult  use marijuana to be paid by cultivation facilities 
21 on adult use marijuana sold to other licensees.  The excise tax is imposed in the following 
22 amounts:
23 A.  For marijuana  flower or  mature  marijuana  plants,  $130  per pound;
24 B.  For marijuana trim, $36.29 per pound;
25 C.  For each immature marijuana plant  or seedling, $1.50; and
26 D.  For each  marijuana seed,  $0.30.
27 22.  It provides that a cultivation facility  licensee monthly must pay directly to the 
28 municipality in which  the cultivation facility  is located 5% of the excise  tax payments 
29 required under the Act during the prior  month.  All other  revenue resulting from the 
30 imposition of the excise tax on adult use marijuana under the Act must be deposited into 
31 the General Fund,  except that:
32 A.  One percent of the total monthly other excise tax revenue generated statewide 
33 must be distributed  in equal amounts  to each municipality that had a cultivation 
34 facility, products  manufacturing facility, marijuana  store or marijuana social club in 
35 operation within the municipality during the prior month; and
36 B.  Twelve percent of the remaining total monthly other  excise tax revenue after the 
37 distribution to municipalities under paragraph  A must be transferred to the Adult Use 
38 Marijuana Public Health and  Safety  Fund.
39 23.  It establishes  the Adult Use Marijuana Public Health and Safety  Fund,  which  is 
40 primarily funded through dedicated excise  and sales tax revenue from the sale of adult 
Page 73 - 128LR2805(01)-11 use marijuana  and adult use marijuana products,  to be used by the department to facilitate 
2 public health and safety awareness and education  programs, initiatives, campaigns  and 
3 activities and enhanced  law enforcement training  programs  for local, county and state law 
4 enforcement officers.
5 24.  It eliminates the Retail Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund,  which  was 
6 created and funded through the enactment of Public Law 2017, chapter 278, and transfers 
7 its remaining balances  to the new Adult Use Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund.
8 25.  It affects  the provisions of the former  Marijuana Legalization Act relating  to the 
9 personal use of marijuana and marijuana products and the home  cultivation of marijuana 
10 for personal adult use as follows:
11 A.  It retains the provisions of the former Marijuana Legalization Act authorizing a 
12 person 21 years  of age or older to purchase from a marijuana store or, where 
13 applicable, from a marijuana social club and possess for personal use up to 2 1/2 
14 ounces of marijuana  or 2 1/2 ounces of a combination of marijuana and marijuana 
15 concentrate that includes no more than 5 grams  of marijuana concentrate;
16 B.  It clarifies language regarding the transfer or furnishing of marijuana or marijuana 
17 products, without  remuneration,  to another person to specify that remuneration  
18 includes a donation  or any other monetary payment received  directly or indirectly by 
19 a person in exchange for goods or services as part of a transaction in which marijuana 
20 or marijuana products are transferred  or furnished by that person to another person;
21 C.  It authorizes a person 21 years  of age or older  to purchase up to 12 immature 
22 marijuana plants or seedlings from a marijuana store  or a nursery  cultivation  facility;
23 D.  It clarifies the provisions relating  to the home  cultivation of marijuana for 
24 personal adult  use by authorizing  a person 21 years  of age or older to grow and 
25 harvest the marijuana produced by up to 6 mature marijuana plants, up to 12 
26 immature marijuana plants and an unlimited number  of seedlings at that person's  
27 place of residence, on a parcel or tract of land owned by that person or on a parcel or 
28 tract of land owned by another person with the written permission of that owner.  It 
29 provides, however, that no more than 12 mature marijuana  plants  may be cultivated 
30 for personal adult use on any one parcel or tract of land, except when the parcel or 
31 tract of land is located in a municipality that has, by adopted ordinance, authorized 
32 the cultivation of more than 12 mature  marijuana plants  for personal  adult use but not 
33 more than 18 mature marijuana plants for personal adult use.  These limitations on 
34 home cultivation  of marijuana for personal adult use do not apply to the cultivation  of 
35 marijuana for medical  use by a qualifying  patient,  a primary  caregiver, a registered 
36 primary caregiver or a registered dispensary under the Maine  Medical  Use of 
37 Marijuana Act;  
38 E.  It retains  the provisions  relating  to the consumption of marijuana and marijuana 
39 products as enacted by Public Law 2017, chapter 1; and
40 F.  It prohibits the home  extraction of marijuana concentrate by use of inherently 
41 hazardous substances.
42 PART B

2 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1111-A, does not apply  to drug paraphernalia 
3 relating to the adult  use of marijuana by a person  as authorized under  the Act or to drug 
4 paraphernalia relating to the sale or offering for sale of marijuana by a licensed adult use 
5 marijuana store or adult  use marijuana social club.
6 This Part also amends the law concerning the Department of Public Safety,  Bureau  of

8 Bureau of Identification to conduct criminal history record checks on applicants  for a 
9 license to operate an adult  use marijuana establishment and on other persons  as required 
10 under the  Act. 
11 PART C
12 This Part amends the State's laws governing municipal powers and duties  to provide  
13 that plantations have the same  powers  and duties as  cities  and towns  under the Act.
14 PART D

29 C.  Twelve percent of the remaining  total monthly tax revenue  after the distribution  to 
30 municipalities under paragraphs A and B must  be transferred to the Adult Use 
31 Marijuana Public Health and  Safety  Fund.
