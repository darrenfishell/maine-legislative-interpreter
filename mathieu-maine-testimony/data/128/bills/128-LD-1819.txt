8 SUMMARY
9 This bill defines "female genital  mutilation" and makes it a Class A crime to perform 
10 female genital  mutilation on a female individual under  18 years  of age for nonmedical 
11 purposes or a Class B crime if the person  who performs  the female  genital  mutilation is a 
12 parent, guardian  or someone who has immediate custody of the female individual.  This 
13 bill also criminalizes transporting a female  individual  under 18 years of age outside  of the 
14 State for the purpose of undergoing female genital mutilation.  A physician  licensed in 
15 Maine who performs a female genital mutilation of a minor is subject to permanent 
16 revocation of the  medical license  of that physician.
17 This bill extends the statute  of limitations to the 25th birthday of a victim of female 
18 genital mutilation  and allows, in order to determine the age of a female individual who is 
19 a victim of female  genital mutilation and who does not have  a birth certificate, the use of 
20 school records or a document  filed with a government agency to establish the age of the 
21 female individual.
22 Under the provisions of the bill, it is not a defense to prosecution that the female 
23 individual, or the parent,  guardian or person who has immediate  custody of the female  
24 individual, consented to the procedure  or believed that it was necessary for custom, 
25 religion or ritual.   It is a defense to prosecution  that the procedure was done for purposes 
26 related to the health of the female individual by a person  licensed as a physician  in this 
27 State.
