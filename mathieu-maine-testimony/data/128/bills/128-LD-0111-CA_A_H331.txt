24 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
25 This amendment replaces the bill, which requires the establishment of a veterans 
26 treatment court in Androscoggin County. Instead, this amendment relies on the enabling 
27 language already in statute for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court to establish 
28 veterans treatment courts where appropriate and provides the funding for the courts as 
29 well as for the services to be provided.

This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $10,800 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $14,400 in fiscal year 2018-19 
for the Judicial Department to establish a Veterans Court. The Govemor's biennial budget for the 2018-2019 
biennium, LD 390, provides funding to increase the rate paid to Active Retired Judges. This estimate of fiscal impact 
may need to be revised based on final Legislative action on the biennial budget. 
The bill also includes annual General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$125,000 beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 for case management services provided by the Office of Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services for a veteran's treatment program.
