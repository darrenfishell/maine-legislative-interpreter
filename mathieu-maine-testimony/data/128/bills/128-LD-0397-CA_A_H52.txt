school administrative unit is to receive be determined utilizing a separate distribution methodology than the 
distribution methodology provided in current law will result in some school administrative units receiving more 
funding than they would have received under current law and some school administrative units receiving less. The 
impact to individual school administrative units can not be determined at this time.
