The bill has an effective date of January 1, 2019, so only contracts executed after January 1, 2019 will be required to 
meet the coverage in this bill. Thus, the State Employee Health Plan will require no General Fund appropriations or 
Highway Fund allocations in the current biennium. It is estimated that this bill will have an annual impact of $53,991 
to the General Fund and $1,629 to the Highway Fund for the increased costs for coverage of hearing aids beginning on 
July 1, 2019.
