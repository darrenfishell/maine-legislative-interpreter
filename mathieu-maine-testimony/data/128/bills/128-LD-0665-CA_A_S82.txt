SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment changes 
the title of the bill. The amendment removes from the bill a requirement that the court 
finds that the individual has an abnormal condition of the mind as a result of an 
intellectual disability or an autism spectrum disorder and instead requires the court to find 
that the individual has an intellectual disability or an autism spectrum disorder. The 
amendment provides that the sentencing discretion that the court has does not apply to a 
sentence for murder. The amendment adds an appropriations and allocations section.
