Fiscal Note 
No net fiscal impact 
The amounts in the bill for the state costs included in the municipal cost components are based on budgeted 
expenditures for fiscal year 2017-18. These costs are incorporated into the tax assessment for the unorganized 
territory, which is collected as dedicated revenue to the Unorganized Territory Education and Services Fund. 
Transfers are then made to the other dedicated accounts for certain expenditures related to the Unorganized Territory 
and to the General Fund to reimburse for actual General Fund expenditures included in the municipal cost 
components. This bill will not affect budgeted General Fund revenue or appropriations.
