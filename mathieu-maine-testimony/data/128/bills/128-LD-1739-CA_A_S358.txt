Fiscal Note 
Lease of Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site authorized 
The pennissive language of this resolve would allow but not require the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry to enter into a lease agreement of the Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site to the non-profit entity Friends 
of Colonial Pemaquid (FOCP) for historic preservation, public recreation and educational uses. The bill does not 
indicate the financial tenns of such a lease, but it does require that it contain a reversion clause specifying that the site 
will revert back to the State if FOCP does not continue to use the site for public education, historical or cultural 
purposes. Without specific terms no estimate of the fiscal impact of this bill can be made.
