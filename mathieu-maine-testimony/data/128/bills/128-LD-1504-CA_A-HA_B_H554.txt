SUMMARY 
This amendment to Committee Amendment "A" requires a net energy billing 
customer that applies for a net energy billing arrangement by December 31, 2017 to 
receive 100% of the net energy of an eligible facility for the customer's transmission and 
distribution bill, a customer that applies for a net energy billing atTangement after 
December 31, 2017 and by December 31, 2018 to receive 90% of the net energy of an 
eligible facility for the customer's transmission and distribution bill and a customer that 
applies for a net energy billing atTangement after December 31, 2018 and by December 
31, 2019 to receive 80% of the net energy of an eligible facility for the customer's 
transmission and distribution bill. It allows the Public Utilities Commission by rule to 
reduce by up to 10% in any calendar year after December 31, 2019 the percentage of an 
eligible customer's net energy that applies to that customer's transmission and 
distribution bill as long as any reduction applies only to customers that apply for a net 
energy billing arrangement in that calendar year. It specifies that an eligible customer that 
applies for a net energy billing arrangement by December 31, 2017 may continue with the 
net energy billing arrangement until the end of the calendar year in 2032 and that an 
eligible customer that applies for a net energy billing arrangement after December 31, 
2017 may continue with that net energy billing atTangement until the end of the calendar 
year that is 15 years from the year in which the customer applied for the net energy 
billing arrangement. It reduces from 200 to 100 the number of eligible customers that 
may participate in a shared interest in an eligible facility or the number of meters 
associated with a single shared interest in an eligible facility. It changes the date for a 
repott required to be submitted to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters by the Public Utilities Commission from
