This bill grants the Maine Developmental Services Oversight and Advis01y Board direct access to the personal 
planning and other records of a person receiving adult developmental services and grants the board direct access to thF 
records of an investigation into the suspicious death of or the records of a mortality review pertaining to a person witL 
intellectual disabilities or autism. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to notify the 
board of any report made to a medical examiner regarding a mandated reporter's knowledge or reasonable suspicion 
that an adult receiving adult developmental services has died as a result of abuse or neglect. It is expected that two 
DHHS systems, the Enterprise Information System (EIS) and the Maine Adult Protective Services Infom1ation System 
(MAPSIS), will require functionality updates to allow direct access for board members. The cost for these updates is 
estimated to be $39,978. The bill requires that its provisions be canied out within existing budgeted resomces. 
Because no funding was provided in the bill, the impact on other programs and services cannot be detennined.
