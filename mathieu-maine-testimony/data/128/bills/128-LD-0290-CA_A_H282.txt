COMMITTEE AMENDMENT «}4 "to H.P. 223, L.D. 290, Bill, "An Act To Phase 
Out the Insurance Premium Tax on Annuities" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 2. 36 MRSA §2513-C is enacted to read: 
§2513-C. Tax on annuity considerations 
1. Phase-out of tax. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the rate of 
tax under this chapter for annuity considerations is 1.5% in 2018, 1 % in 2019 and 0.5% in 
2020. Beginning in 2021, annuity considerations are not subject to tax under this chapter, 
but taxes due for previous years may be collected. 
2. Application of reduced rate on annuities. The reduced rates specified in 
subsection 1 for 2018, 2019 and 2020 apply to premiums on an annuity paid by annuity 
holders in this State only if the tax savings from the reduced rate are credited to the 
annuity holders. Upon request of the bureau, an insurer shall submit evidence that 
establishes that the tax savings derived from the reduced rate under this section have been 
credited to the annuity holders. 
Sec. 3. 36 MRSA §2515, as amended by PL 2013, c. 331, Pt. C, §11, is further 
amended to read: 
§2515. Amount of tax 
In determining the amount of tax due under sections 2513 and 2531, each company 
shall deduct from the full amount of gross direct premiums the amount of all direct return 
premiums on the gross direct premiums and all dividends paid to policyholders on direct 
premiums, and the tax must be computed by those companies or their agents. Except 
when direct return premiums are returned in the same tax year that the premium was paid, 
the deduction allowed in this section may be taken only if the tax under this Part has been 
paid. The deductions under this section related to annuity considerations may be 
deducted only from annuity considerations.
