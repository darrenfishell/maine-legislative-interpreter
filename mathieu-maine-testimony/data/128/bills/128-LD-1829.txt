31 SUMMARY
32 This bill makes the  following changes  to the laws governing  education.
33 1.  It changes  the procedure and date for reporting adult education funding  levels.
34 2.  It changes  the duties of teachers  and parents when a student is a public health 
35 threat.  It allows a superintendent  to consult with the school nurse upon being informed  
36 by a teacher that a  student  is a public health threat.
37 3.  It eliminates the  Maine  Online Learning Program.
Page 5 - 128LR2730(01)-11 4.  It directs the Commissioner of Education to collaborate with the school nurse 
2 consultant to adopt rules  and provide school administrative units with a copy of these  
3 rules and guidance  regarding the screening of students for sight and hearing  defects. It 
4 removes the requirement  that the commissioner  furnish  to administrators of school  
5 administrative units  the prescribed directions for the sight and hearing tests of students.  It 
6 requires the commissioner  to furnish guidance, training and sample report and referral 
7 forms in connection with these  tests.   It removes a reference to religious grounds from the 
8 provision governing  exempt students to provide  that a student whose  parent objects  in 
9 writing to screening may not be screened  unless a sight  or hearing  defect is reasonably 
10 apparent.
11 5.  It removes  the requirement that a school nurse  or trained screener collect body 
12 mass index data from students  and report this data in the aggregate to the Department of 
13 Health and Human Services, Maine  Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
14 6.  It requires a school board to appoint appropriate school staff to inform a parent of 
15 a student  suffering  from  a suspected disease or  defect based on results of a  screening.
16 7.  It removes enrichment courses from the definition of "adult education."
17 8.  It changes  the provisions for issuance of high school  equivalency  diplomas.
18 9.  It specifies  criteria  that must be met in order for the Commissioner of Education  to 
19 grant a waiver to allow  a student who has reached 20 years of age before the start of the 
20 school year to be enrolled as a public secondary school  student.  It repeals the provisions 
21 of law that allow  a person  to obtain such a waiver  effective July 1, 2020.
22 10.  It amends the laws governing the employment  of conditionally certified  persons 
23 to provide  that the requirement that a school administrative unit provide professional  
24 development and intensive  supervision applies only to teachers and not to educational 
25 specialists.
26 11.  It amends  the laws governing qualifications  for a professional teacher certificate 
27 to require  that a person who has successfully  completed  a preparation program in a state 
28 with which  the State is participating in an interstate  compact must complete an approved 
29 preparation program  with a formal recommendation  for certification from the institution 
30 and must  meet the  specified teaching experience requirement.
