Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes statutory references to "alcoholic" and "alcoholism" as 
"substance use disorder" includes both alcohol and drug dependence. It also removes 
statutory references to "drug-dependent person" as this term is included in the term 
"person with a substance use disorder." It changes the definition of "person with 
substance use disorder" that is in the bill to a definition similar to that used in the clinical 
setting. It also removes provisions from the bill that rename the Office of Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health in the Department of Health and Human Services. The 
amendment requires that all executive agencies, rather than only the Department of 
Health and Human Services, replace references to "substance abuse" with "substance use 
disorder" in rules, forms, policies and publications and specifies that those changes must 
occur as agencies amend or create those documents. The amendment also removes the 
emergency preamble and emergency clause.
