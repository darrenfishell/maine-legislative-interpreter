COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITIEE AMENDMENT" Dr." to S.P. 432, L.D. 1280 
1 product developer applies only to manufacturers and wholesalers of drugs licensed in this 
2 State under the Maine Pharmacy Act. The amendment further requires sale of a drug 
3 distributed in this State to eligible product developers at a fair market price for purposes 
4 of supporting the eligible product developer's application for approval of a drug under the 
5 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Section 505(b) or 505(j) or the licensing of a 
6 biological product under the federal Public Health Service Act, Section 351. The 
7 licensed manufacturer or wholesaler may not impose any restriction on the sale that 
8 would block or delay the eligible product developer's application in a manner inconsistent 
9 with Section 505-1(£)(8) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 United States 
10 Code, Section 355-1(£)(8) (2016). 
11 The amendment ensures increased competition in the market for drugs and biological 
12 products, which will lower the cost of prescription drugs for Maine residents and for the 
13 State. Developers oflow-cost generic drugs and biosimilar biological products must have 
14 access to approved drugs distributed in this State by licensed wholesalers and 
15 manufacturers to engage in bioequivalence and biosimilarity testing prior to receiving 
16 approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for sale of their generic drugs 
17 and biosimilar biological products. Federal laws and regulations governing 
18 bioequivalence and biosimilarity testing are designed to ensure availability of generic 
19 drugs and biosimilar biological products in a timely manner without risking patient 
20 safety, even in cases where an FDA-approved drug is subject to iisk evaluation and 
21 mitigation strategies and elements to assure safe use, or REMS with ETASU, under 
22 Section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 United States Code, 
23 Section 355-1 (2016). Wholesalers and manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs have used 
24 REMS with ET ASU programs imposed by the FDA as excuses for refusing to sell their 
25 drugs and biological products to eligible product developers, despite the prohibition in 
26 Section 505-1(£)(8) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 United States Code, 
27 Section 355-1(£)(8) against such use of REMS with ETASU requirements "to block or 
28 delay approval" of a new generic drug or biosimilar biological product.
