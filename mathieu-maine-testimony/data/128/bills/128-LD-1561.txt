SUMMARY  12 
This bill establishes the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Act.  It provides a 13 
public financing mechanism for committees that are Maine -chartered nonprofits or 14 
groups whose principal off icers are Maine citizens and are formed to support or oppose a 15 
citizens' initiative ballot question or a people's veto or to support a competing measure to 16 
a citizens' initiative ballot question.  The funding process is similar to that provided for 17 
clean e lection candidates under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21 -A, chapter 14.  It 18 
provides for limits on the amount of funds that committees seeking public funding may 19 
raise and spend prior to qualifying for public funding and the amount of qualifying 20 
contr ibutions that a committee must raise to be certified to receive public funding, and it 21 
establishes the amounts that certified committees may receive.  It also establishes 22 
procedures governing financial reporting and accounting, appeals of decisions, penalt ies 23 
for violations and other procedural matters to ensure the integrity of the process.  In 24 
addition to other available funds, including qualifying contributions raised by committees 25 
and voluntary contributions through a tax checkoff program, funding for c ertified 26 
committees is provided by an annual appropriation of $3,000,000.  27
