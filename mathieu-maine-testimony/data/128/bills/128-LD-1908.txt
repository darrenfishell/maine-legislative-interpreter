25 not needed  to meet current obligations, the Treasurer of State may invest, with the 
26 concurrence of the State Controller or the Commissioner of Administrative  and Financial  
27 Services and with the consent of the Governor,  those amounts in bonds, notes,  certificates  
28 of indebtedness or other obligations of the United States and its agencies and

33 than 36 months  from  the date of investment, banker's acceptances or so-called "no-load" 
34 shares of any investment company registered under  the federal Investment  Company  Act 
35 of 1940, as amended,  that complies with Rule 2a-7 guidelines and maintains a constant 
36 share price.  The Treasurer of State  may participate in the securities loan market by 
37 loaning state-owned bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness of the Federal  
38 Government, only if loans are fully  collateralized by treasury  bills or cash.  The Treasurer 
39 of State shall seek competitive  bids for investments except when, after a reasonable 
40 investigation, it appears  that an investment  of the desired  maturity  is procurable by the 
41 State from only one source.  Interest earned on those investments of money must be 
42 credited to the respective funds,  except  that interest earned  on investments  of the General 
43 Fund and special revenue  funds  must be credited to the General Fund of the State

9 the several funds of the State in banks or safe deposit companies in this State or any other  
10 state, nor the deposit of state funds required by the terms of custodial contracts or 
11 agreements negotiated in accordance with the laws of this State.  All custodial contracts 
12 and agreements  are subject  to the approval of the Governor.
