 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA §201, sub -§3, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 2 
affected by §§9 to 11, is repealed.  3 
Sec. 2.  39-A MRSA §201, sub -§3-A is enacted to read:  4 
3-A.  Mental injury caused  by mental stress.   Mental injury resulting from work - 5 
related stress does not arise out of and in the course of employment unless:  6 
A.  It is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that:  7 
(1)  The work stress was extraordinary and unusual in compariso n to pressures 8 
and tensions experienced by the average employee; and  9 
(2)  The work stress, and not some other source of stress, was the predominant 10 
cause of the mental injury.  11 
The amount of work stress must be measured by objective standards and actual 12 
events rather than any misperceptions by the employee; or  13 
B.  The employee is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, corrections officer or 14 
emergency medical services worker and is diagnosed by an allopathic physician or an 15 
osteopathic physician licensed und er Title 32, chapter 48 or chapter 36, respectively, 16 
with a specialization in psychiatry or a psychologist licensed under Title 32, chapter 17 
56 as having post -traumatic stress disorder, in which case the post -traumatic stress 18 
disorder is presumed to have ar isen out of and in the course of the worker's 19 
employment.  This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to 20 
the contrary.  For purposes of this paragraph, "law enforcement officer," "firefighter," 21 
"corrections officer" and "emergency me dical services worker" have the same 22 
meaning as in section 328 -A, subsection 1.  23 
A mental injury is not considered to arise out of and in the course of employment if it 24 
results from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff, demotion, 25 
termination or any similar action, taken in good faith by the employer.  26 
SUMMARY  27 
This bill establishes a rebuttable presumption under the laws governing workers' 28 
compensation that when a law enforcement officer, firefighter, corrections officer or 29 
emergency medical services worker is diagnosed by a licensed physician specializing in 30 
psychiatry or a licensed psychologist as having post -traumatic stress disorder, the post - 31 
traumatic stress disorder is presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the 32 
worke r's employment.  33
