JOINT RESOLUTION HONORING IRISH HERITAGE 
 
 WHEREAS,  millions of Irish people emigrated from Ireland in the 1800s to escape brutal 
poverty and starvation due to the Irish potato fami ne, and most of those people came to America 
to start new lives and to embrace and contribute to  a new land; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  tens of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in Ne w England and many 
came to Maine, and the Irish have been and remain a n important part of Maine's culture, history 
and society; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  within a few years of their arrival in the United S tates and in Maine, these 
Irish immigrants became part of the American cultur al landscape while preserving the best of 
their native culture, and they dedicated themselves  to helping build this State and Nation; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  4 signers of the Declaration of Independence were I rish-born and 9 signers 
were of Irish ancestry and 19 Presidents of the Uni ted States have proudly claimed Irish heritage, 
including George Washington, the father of our coun try; John Fitzgerald Kennedy; Ronald 
Reagan; and Barack H. Obama; and 
 
 WHEREAS,  the over 33,000,000 Americans of Irish ancestry, li ke their forebears, 
continue to enrich all aspects of life in the Unite d States, in science, education, art, agriculture, 
business, industry, literature, music, athletics, e ntertainment and military and government 
service; now, therefore, be it 
 
 RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature 
now assembled in the Second Regular Session, on beh alf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to recognize the valuable contribution to our State and to our Nation of all Irish-
American citizens and we urge the citizens of the S tate to commend and celebrate the integrity 
and richness of the Irish culture.
