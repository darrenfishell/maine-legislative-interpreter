This floor amendment removes the delay in retail sales of marijuana. The incremental impact is to eliminate the 
General Fund and Local Government Fund revenue reductions of $490,000 and $10,000, respectively, that would 
have resulted from the delay. $0

With the elimination of the delay, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will be required to 
implement the licensing and enforcement functions of the legalization of marijuana. The department will still require 
additional appropriations or allocations to accomplish these tasks.
