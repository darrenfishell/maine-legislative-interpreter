10 Repeal Certain Provisions Regarding the System Administration Allocation Affecting 
11 Maine School Districts in the 2018-2019 Biennial Budget" 
12 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
13 summary and inserting the following: 
14 'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA §15680-A, sub-§3, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. C, 
15 §35, is repealed. 
16 Sec. 2. 20-A MRSA §15680-A, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 2017, c. 284, Pt. C, 
17 §35, is amended to read: 
18 4. Beginning in fiscal year 2019-20. Beginning in fiscal year 2020 21 2019-20, the 
19 per-pupil rate for the system administration allocation must be determined by the 
20 commissioner based on a review by a statewide education policy research institute of the 
21 system administration costs of high-performing, efficient school administrative units. 
22 Only school administrative units that have established regionalized administrative 
23 services pursuant to chapter 123 and school administrative units for which the percentage

25 school administrative units by a statewide education policy research institute are eligible 
26 for the system administration allocation.' 
27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
29 the bill. Like the bill, the amendment amends the system administration allocation law by 
30 striking the requirement that, beginning in fiscal year 2019-20, a portion of the system 
31 administration allocation must be allocated to school administrative units that have 
32 established regionalized administrative services. Instead, the amendment provides that 
3 3 only school administrative units that have established regionalized administrative services 
34 and school administrative units that are identified as high-performing, efficient school 
3 5 administrative units by a statewide education policy research institute due to their

Redistribution of state subsidy -Local school administrative units 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation repeals the sections of current law that set the per-pupil amounts for system administration to be 
allocated to school administrative units (SAU's) in fiscal year 2019-20 and instead requires that, beginning in fiscal 
year 2019-20, the per-pupil allocation be provided only to those SAU's that have established regionalized 
administrative services pursuant to Title 20-A, chapter 123 or are identified as high-performing, efficient schools 
based on a review of system administration costs for high-performing, efficient SAU's. 
This change will result in a redistribution of state subsidy in fiscal year 2019-20, with some SA U's receiving more 
subsidy than would have been received absent this legislation and some SAU's receiving less. The impact to 
individual SAU's can not be determined.
