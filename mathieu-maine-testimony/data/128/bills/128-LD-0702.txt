 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA ยง664, sub -ยง2, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, ยง2, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 4 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 5 
established in this section.  Starting January 1, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid 6 
directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour, and the tip 7 
credit may not exceed the dif ference between the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 8 
tipped service employee and the minimum hourly wage established under subsection 1.  9 
Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January 1st thereafter, the minimum cash wage 10 
paid directly to a tipped serv ice employee must be increased by an additional $1.00 per 11 
hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage 12 
established under subsection 1, except that if the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 13 
tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less than the annually adjusted minimum 14 
hourly wage, it must be increased by that lesser amount.   An employer who elects to use 15 
the tip credit , until it is eliminated under this subsection,  must inform the affected 16 
employee in advance and m ust be able to show that the employee receives at least the 17 
minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are combined.  Upon a 18 
satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's representative that the actual tips 19 
received were less than th e tip credit, the employer shall increase the direct wages by the 20 
difference.  21 
The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 22 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically included in the customer's 23 
bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 24 
employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 25 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaitin g 26 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  27 
SUMMARY  28 
This bill restores the tip credit in the minimum wage laws.  29
