Page 1 - 128LR2419(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, in the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature, the Legislature 
4 enacted "An Act To Recognize Local Control Regarding  Food Systems," which  the 
5 Governor, on June 16, 2017,  signed  and which became  Public Law 2017, chapter 215, 
6 effective November  1, 2017; and
7 Whereas, under provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection  Act and the Federal 
8 Poultry Products Inspection Act, the United States Department  of Agriculture, Food  
9 Safety and Inspection Service has questioned the State's authority under  Public Law 
10 2017, chapter 215 to enforce the requirements of the State's  meat and poultry products 
11 inspection and licensing  program set forth in the Maine  Revised Statutes, Title 22, 
12 chapter 562-A in a manner that is at least equal to the standards  imposed and enforced 
13 under the  federal acts; and
14 Whereas, the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States has notified the 
15 Governor that, on or after November 1, 2017, Maine will become a so-called designated 
16 state for federal  inspection  of all the State's  licensed  or registered slaughtering and 
17 processing establishments,  which would threaten the meat and poultry processing  
18 infrastructure of our State  and potentially cause grave harm to the State's rural  economies; 
19 and
20 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
21 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
22 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
23 therefore,
24 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
