Transfer of land 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This resolve transfers a parcel ofland, approximately .30 acres, from the Colburn House State Historic Site in Pittston 
to the First Congregational Church in Pittston. The transfer will allow the church to build a small addition and have 
room for the required setback from the state property. The Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is authorized to make the transfer "for negotiated value". The 
Director has indicated the land is of little significant value to the State and it appears there will be no eff01t to obtain 
compensation for the transfer of this property.
