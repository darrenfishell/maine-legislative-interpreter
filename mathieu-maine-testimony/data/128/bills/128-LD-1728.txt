29 SUMMARY
30 Current law prohibits visual sexual aggression against  a child, which is either a Class 
31 C crime if the child has not attained 12 years of age or a Class  D crime if the child has not 
32 attained 14 years  of age.
33 This bill amends that law to provide that visual  sexual aggression against a child who 
34 has not attained  14 years of age is a Class C crime  and retains  as an element of the crime  
35 the motivation of the actor  committing the crime for the purpose  of causing affront  or 
36 alarm when the actor exposes the actor's genitals to another person or causes the other  
37 person to expose that  person's genitals to the  actor.
