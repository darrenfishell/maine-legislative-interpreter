16 SUMMARY 
17 This amendment replaces the bill. Like the bill, the amendment provides for a 
18 definition of public service berthing vessel. Unlike the bill, the amendment does not 
19 establish a separate license for a public service berthing vessel but rather makes the vessel 
20 eligible for a Class V liquor license that permits the sale of spirits, wine and malt liquor to 
21 passengers of the vessel. It also provides that the license may be issued for a single event 
22 · or voyage. Like the bill, the amendment requires that the vessel acquire municipal 
23 approval to sell liquor on board the vessel to passengers while the vessel is docked. The 
24 amendment also makes a provision for storage of liquor to be sold by the licensed vessel 
25 and requires that records be maintained for each event when the licensed vessel sells 
26 liquor to passengers.
