wildlife and stipulates the requirements for that permit. The amendment provides that a 
person who allows wildlife in captivity to escape that person's possession or control in 
violation of rules governing keeping wildlife in captivity or an additional permit 
condition or requirement commits a Class E crime if the person does not immediately 
notify a law enforcement officer or if the person notifies a law enforcement officer but 
the wildlife is not permitted. If the wildlife is not permitted and escapes and the person 
does not immediately notify a law enforcement officer, the person commits a Class D 
crime.
