12 monitoring in the  absence of any other evidence  of a leak:
13 A.  To check the accuracy  of complete statistical inventory data within 75 30 days of 
14 receipt by the commissioner of the initial  statistical analysis reconciliation by 
15 rerunning analyses  reconciliations  before inconclusive reports are considered to be a 
16 failure of  the tank  or piping;
17 B.  To check for failures  in any mechanical and electronic monitoring devices  within 
18 3 working days of an indication of failure before it is considered  a failure of the tank 
19 or piping;
20 C.  To engage in procedures  under paragraphs A and B before requiring the precision 
21 testing of  facility components;  and
22 D.  To check the accuracy of a failed  or inconclusive precision  test of facility

24 portion of the facility.   An owner or operator is allowed 2 weeks to schedule a repeat 
25 of the precision test;
26 Sec. 3.  38 MRSA  §564, first ¶, as amended by PL 1989, c. 865, §10, is further

19 (4)  Manual  ground water sampling capable  of detecting  the presence  of at least 
20 1/8 inch of free product  on top of the ground water table in a reasonable  number  
21 of ground water monitoring wells  installed in the excavated area, and to detect a 
22 leak or discharge  of oil from the product piping not installed in accordance with 
23 subparagraph (1), one  of the following:

37 probability of detecting a  leak  and a 5%  chance  of false alarm.
Page 3 - 128LR2737(01)-11 Ground water  monitoring for the detection of leaks  may only be used to meet the 
2 requirements of this paragraph where the ground water table is never  more  than 20 
3 feet from the ground surface and the hydraulic  conductivity  of the soils between the

2 10 gallons or less that occurs on the premises,  including, but not limited to, spills,  
3 overfills and leaks, when  those leaks  or discharges  do not reach groundwaters  or 
4 surface waters of the State  and are cleaned up within 24 hours of discovery,  if a 
5 written log is maintained at the facility  or the owner's place of business in this State.  
6 For each discharge the log must record the date of discovery, its source, the general 
7 location of the discharge  at the facility, the date and method of cleanup and the 
8 signature of the facility owner or operator certifying the accuracy  of the log;

31 operated in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, including rules adopted 
32 under this subchapter:  tanks  providing product to a generator; double-walled tanks with 
33 continuous interstitial  space  monitoring; and existing tanks constructed of fiberglass,

37 Sec. 6.  38 MRSA §564, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 361, §1, is amended to 
38 read:
39 6.  Retrofit  of existing underground tanks.  The board's department's rules  must 
40 allow a person to retrofit a single- walled underground  oil storage tank with secondary 
41 containment as long as the retrofitted  tank complies with Underwriters Laboratories 
42 Subject 1316 or 1856 and interstitial monitoring of the retrofitted tank is equal  to or 
43 greater than interstitial  monitoring of a new tank.  The board department shall require a 
Page 5 - 128LR2737(01)-11 site assessment of an underground oil storage facility when a tank is retrofitted in 
2 accordance with this subsection.
3 Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §566-A, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 276, §2, is further 
4 amended to read:
5 1.  Abandonment.   All Except as provided by subsection 1-A, all underground oil 
6 storage facilities and tanks  that have been, or are intended to be, taken  out of service for a 
7 period of more than 24 12 months must be properly abandoned by the owner  or operator 
8 of the facility or tank or, if the owner or operator is unknown, dissolved or insolvent, by 
9 the current owner of the property where  the facility  or tank is located.  All abandoned 
10 facilities and tanks must be removed, except where removal is not physically possible or 
11 practicable because the tank or  other component of the facility to be removed is: 
12 A.  Located beneath a  building  or other permanent structure;
13 B.  Of a size and type of construction that  it cannot be removed;
14 C.  Otherwise inaccessible to heavy equipment necessary  for removal; or
15 D.  Positioned  in such a manner that removal  will endanger the structural integrity  of 
16 nearby tanks.
17 Sec. 8.  38 MRSA  §566-A, sub-§1-A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 276, §3, is 
18 further amended  to read:
19 1-A.  Abandoned tanks brought back into service.  Underground oil storage  tanks  
20 and facilities that have been  out of service for a period  of more than 24 12 months may 
21 not be brought back into service without the written  approval of the commissioner.  The 
22 commissioner may approve the return to service if the owner  demonstrates  to the 
23 commissioner's satisfaction that:
24 A.  The facility is in compliance with this subchapter and rules  adopted  pursuant to 
25 this subchapter;
26 B.  The underground  oil storage tanks and piping have successfully passed testing as 
27 directed by the commissioner; 
28 C.  The underground oil storage  tanks  and piping are constructed of fiberglass, 
29 cathodically protected steel or other equally noncorrosive material approved by the 
30 commissioner;
31 D.  The  facility has conforming suction or double-walled  pressurized piping; and
32 E.  The return  of the facility to service does not pose an unacceptable risk to 
33 groundwater resources.  In determining if the facility poses an unacceptable risk to 
34 groundwater resources, the commissioner may consider the age and maintenance 
35 history of the storage tanks and piping, the number and consequences of past oil 
36 discharges from  the tanks and piping, the proximity of the facility to drinking water  
37 supplies and the proximity of the facility to sensitive geologic areas.
38 The commissioner may not approve the return to service of a single -walled  underground  
39 oil storage tank that  has been out of service for  more than 24 12 consecutive months.
Page 6 - 128LR2737(01)-11 Sec. 9.  38 MRSA §566-A, sub-§3,  as amended by PL 1991, c. 88, §1, is further 
2 amended to read:
3 3.  Rulemaking.  The board department shall  adopt rules  allowing for the granting of 
4 a variance from the requirement of removal where  abandonment by removal  is not 
5 physically possible or practicable due to circumstances  other than those  listed in this 
6 subsection.  The board department shall adopt  rules setting forth the proper procedures 
7 for abandonment  of underground oil storage facilities  and tanks, including requirements 
8 and procedures  to conduct a site assessment for the presence of discharges of oil prior  to 
9 completion of abandonment at facilities  storing motor  fuel or used in the marketing and 
10 distribution of oil, acceptable  methods of disposing of the removed  tanks, requirements 
11 for venting  at least 12 feet above  ground level flammable gases purged  from  tanks and 
12 from trucks  removing oil from tanks and procedures for abandonment in place where 
13 removal of a tank or other component of a facility  is determined not physically possible 
14 or practicable.
15 Sec. 10.  38 MRSA §570-F, as repealed  and replaced by PL 1991, c. 494, §15 and

27 The board department shall adopt rules for underground oil storage  facilities  for 
28 storing waste oil.  The board department  shall also promulgate adopt rules governing 
29 field- constructed,  airport hydrant and heavy oil underground oil storage facilities.  These 
30 rules are not limited by the  other provisions of this subchapter II-B.

32 §570-N.  Rules;  wastewater treatment  tank systems
33 The department may adopt rules  regulating  wastewater treatment tank systems,  
34 including oil-water separators and catch  basins, that meet  the definition of "underground 
35 oil storage tank," except that  this section  does  not apply to:
36 1.  Oil-water separators.  Oil-water separators  and catch basins under section 570-F, 
37 subsection 2; and
Page 7 - 128LR2737(01)-11 2.  Storm water or wastewater collection.  Storm  water or wastewater collection
