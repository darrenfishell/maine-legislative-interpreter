WHEREAS, separate provisions of the Constitution of Maine, a dopted at different times,

"by a plurality of all votes returned," Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 1, ยง5 and art. V, pt. 1, ยง3, and those  
elected to the Senate "by a plurality of the votes in each senatorial district," Me. Const. art. IV, 
pt. 2, ยง4; and 
WHEREAS, Article IV, Part First, Section 5 of the Constituti on of Maine provides that in 
elections for the House of Representatives, "the el ection officials of the various towns and cities 
shall ... receive the votes of all the qualified el ectors, sort, count and declare them in open 
meeting; and a list of the persons voted for shall be formed, with the number of votes for each 
person against that person's name. ... Fair copies of the lists of votes shall be attested by the 
municipal officers and the clerks of the cities and  towns [who] shall cause the same to be 
delivered into the office of the Secretary of State  forthwith ... [and] [t]he Governor shall examine 
the returned copies of such lists and ... shall iss ue a summons to such persons as shall appear to 
have been elected by a plurality of all votes retur ned, to attend and take their seats."; and 
WHEREAS, Article IV, Part Second, Section 3 of the Constitut ion of Maine provides that 
meetings for the election of Senators "shall be not ified, held and regulated and the votes 
received, sorted, counted, declared and recorded, i n the same manner as those for 
Representatives.  Fair copies of the lists of votes  shall be attested by the clerks of the cities and 
towns or other duly authorized officials and sealed  up in open meetings and ... delivered into the 
office of the Secretary of State forthwith."; and A rticle IV, Part Second, Section 4 further 
provides that "[t]he Governor shall ... examine the  copies of such lists, and ... issue a summons to 
such persons, as shall appear to be elected by a pl urality of the votes in each senatorial district, t o 
attend that day and take their seats."; and 
WHEREAS, Article V, Part First, Section 3 of the Constitutio n of Maine provides that 
"meetings for election of Governor shall be notifie d, held and regulated and votes shall be 
received, sorted, counted and declared and recorded , in the same manner as those for Senators 
and Representatives.  Copies of lists of votes shal l be sealed and returned to the secretary's office 
in the same manner and at the same time as those fo r Senators.  The Secretary of State ... shall ... 
lay the lists returned to the secretary's office be fore the Senate and House of Representatives to 
be by them examined, ... and they shall determine t he number of votes duly cast for the office of 
Governor, and in case of a choice by plurality of a ll of the votes returned they shall declare and 
publish the same."; and 
WHEREAS, Article V, Part First, Section 3 of the Constitutio n of Maine further provides 
that "[i]f there shall be a tie between the 2 perso ns having the largest number of votes for 
Governor, the House of Representatives and the Sena te meeting in joint session, and each 
member of said bodies having a single vote, shall e lect one of said 2 persons having so received 
an equal number of votes and the person so elected by the Senate and House of Representatives 
shall be declared the Governor."; and 
WHEREAS, on November 8, 2016, the voters of the state approv ed a measure referred to 
the people pursuant to Article IV, Part Third, Sect ion 18 of the Constitution of Maine, entitled 
An Act To Establish Ranked-choice Voting, referred to in this order as "the Act," which creates 
new methods of casting ballots for candidates, coun ting votes and determining elections for the 
offices of Governor, State Senator and State Repres entative, as well as the offices of United 
States Senator and Representative to Congress, and applies to elections held on or after January 
1, 2018; and 
  
 Thursday, February 2, 2017 Page 37  
 
WHEREAS, section 2 of the Act defines "ranked-choice voting"  as "the method of casting 
and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidate s in order of preference, tabulation proceeds 
in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates  are defeated and the candidate with the most 
votes in the final round is elected"; and 
WHEREAS, the Act provides that "[f]or offices elected by ran ked-choice voting, the 
Secretary of State shall tabulate the votes accordi ng to the ranked-choice voting method 
described in [the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 21- A,] section 723-A" as enacted by section 5 of 
the Act; and 
WHEREAS, the method of ranked-choice voting described in the  Act does not allow the 
Secretary of State to aggregate the lists of votes compiled by city and town officials and 
submitted to the Secretary as required by the Const itution of Maine as set forth above, but 
instead necessitates that all ballots or images of ballots cast by voters within the entire electoral 
district be delivered to a central location in orde r for the Secretary of State to conduct multiple 
rounds of counting and redistributing voter prefere nces in each subsequent round of counting 
using specially designed computer software; and 
WHEREAS, the Attorney General issued an opinion on March 4, 2016, to the effect that the 
system of ranked-choice voting established in the A ct conflicts with provisions of Article IV, 
Part First, Section 5; Article IV, Part Second, Sec tions 3 and 4; and Article V, Part First, Section 
3 of the Constitution of Maine, which declare that ballots are to be counted by municipal 
officials and that the winner of each electoral rac e is the candidate who received a plurality of the 
votes cast and counted at the municipal level, and further that the ranked-choice method of 
resolving a tie vote in a race for Governor conflic ts with Article V, Part First, Section 3; and 
WHEREAS, the Act appears to conflict with the Constitution o f Maine inasmuch as it would 
not recognize a person obtaining a plurality of the  votes counted and declared by city and town 
officials as having prevailed in the election; woul d fundamentally change the role of city and 
town officials in sorting, counting, declaring and recording votes and would transfer those duties 
to the Secretary of State; and would eliminate the role of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate in resolving tie votes for the office of Gov ernor; and 
WHEREAS, the Act's provision for resolving tie votes for Gov ernor by lot conflicts with 
duties that the Constitution of Maine imposes on Re presentatives and Senators under such 
circumstances pursuant to Article V, Part First, Se ction 3 and, therefore, would require them to 
violate their oath of office pursuant to Article IX , Section 1 of the Constitution of Maine; and 
WHEREAS, if the Act were applied to elections in 2018 withou t resolution of the 
constitutional questions presented here, a candidat e for Representative, Senate or Governor who 
gained a plurality of the votes counted by city and  town officials but failed to prevail in the 
subsequent round or rounds counted centrally by the  Secretary of State pursuant to the Act could 
challenge that candidate's declared loss as violati ve of the plurality vote requirement in the 
Constitution of Maine for the position sought by th at candidate, and thereby place the validity of 
the election into question and delay the seating of  a Representative, Senator or Governor; and 
WHEREAS, failing to address important and unresolved questio ns of law about the 
constitutionality of ranked-choice voting before th e end of the current legislative session would 
create uncertainty over the outcome of any future e lection contests involving more than 2 
candidates; and 
  
 Thursday, February 2, 2017 Page 38  
 
WHEREAS, the Senate requests guidance from the Justices as t o the constitutionality of the 
Act so that it may determine, during the current le gislative session, whether it is necessary to 
propose constitutional amendments for submission to  the voters for approval in November 2017, 
in order to implement ranked-choice voting for elec tions held on or after January 1, 2018, as the 
Act requires; and 
WHEREAS, the 128th Legislature also must determine during th e current legislative session 
whether to authorize and appropriate in excess of $ 1,500,000 in the biennial budget for the 
period beginning July 1, 2017 to implement the Act,  including funds at a minimum for new 
voting equipment and computer software, staff posit ions, ballot printing and transportation and 
storage of ballots for counting in a central locati on; and 
WHEREAS, it is vital that the Senate be informed during the current legislative session as to 
the opinions of the Justices on the questions propo unded in this order; now, therefore, be it 
ORDERED, that, in accordance with the provisions of the Cons titution of Maine, the Senate 
respectfully requests the Justices of the Supreme J udicial Court to give the Senate their opinion 
on the following questions of law: 
Question 1.  Does the Act's requirement that the Se cretary of State count the votes centrally 
in multiple rounds conflict with the provisions of the Constitution of Maine that require that the 
city and town officials sort, count, declare and re cord the votes in elections for Representative, 
Senator and Governor as provided in the Constitutio n of Maine, Article IV, Part First, Section 5, 
Article IV, Part Second, Section 3 and Article V, P art First, Section 3? 
Question 2.  Does the method of ranked-choice votin g established by the Act in elections for 
Representative, Senator and Governor violate the pr ovisions of the Constitution of Maine, 
Article IV, Part First, Section 5, Article IV, Part  Second, Sections 3 and 4 and Article V, Part 
First, Section 3, respectively, which declare that the person elected shall be the candidate who 
receives a plurality of all the votes counted and d eclared by city and town officials as recorded 
on lists returned to the Secretary of State? 
Question 3.  Does the requirement in the Act that a  tie between candidates for Governor in 
the final round of counting be decided by lot confl ict with the provisions of the Constitution of 
Maine, Article V, Part  First, Section 3 relating t o resolution of a tie vote for Governor by the 
House of Representatives and Senate?
