authorizes the owner of a historic property being operated as a lodging place to appeal the 
decision of a municipal inspection officer that the property does not meet the standards of 
the fire and life safety codes adopted by the Commissioner of Public Safety or a provision 
in locally adopted fire and life safety codes that is identical to a provision in the fire and 
life safety code adopted by the commissioner within 30 days. The appeal must be 
submitted in writing to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. If an informal hearing is 
requested, it must be conducted within 3 0 days and may be held at the site of the affected 
property. The Office of the State Fire Marshal must issue a written decision within 30 
days of the appeal or hearing, whichever is later, explaining the reasons for affirming or 
reversing the municipal enforcement decision. The decision of the Office of the State 
Fire Marshal constitutes final agency action and may be appealed to the Superior Court.
