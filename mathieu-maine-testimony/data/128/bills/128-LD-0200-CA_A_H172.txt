pertinent evidence offered by the libelant or claimant. 
( 4) If the court, upon the hearing, is satisfied that the shellfish was not possessed 
in violation of the shellfish conservation ordinance and that the claimant is 
entitled to the custody of the shellfish, the court shall direct the municipality 
having the shellfish or proceeds derived from the sale to deliver to the claimant 
the shellfish or proceeds to which the claimant is found to be entitled within 48 
hours.

libelant costs, including costs of the municipality incurred to hold and handle the
