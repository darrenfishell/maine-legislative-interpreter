Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Change to rate structure of fees assessed by PUC -Maine Telecommunications Education Access Fund 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would cap and change the rate structure for prepaid wireless telecommunications services and voice network 
service providers that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) uses to assess a surcharge or fee that is credited to the 
Maine Telecommunications Education Access Fund (MTEAF). It also updates the definitions of the categories of 
such services to reflect changes in telecommunications industry terminology and billing methods. These changes may 
raise the fee for some services while others may be lowered. As under current law, the PUC will continue to have 
some flexibility to adjust assessments up to the caps to assure adequate funding in the MTEAF. Any additional costs 
to the PUC to implement these changes are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources. 
Additional costs to the Maine State Library and the Department of Education to prepare and submit the 
required report can be absorbed within each agency's existing budgeted resources.
