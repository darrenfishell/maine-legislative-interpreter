Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill makes an applicant for general assistance who voluntarily abandons or refuses to use an available resource 
without just cause ineligible to receive general assistance to replace the abandoned or refused resource for a period of 
120 days. This will potentially reduce assistance payments made by municipalities and reduce amounts reimbursed to 
municipalities by the Department of Health and Human Services. The potential savings to the department is not 
expected to be significant because the frequency of refusing or abandoning resources is expected to be very small, the 
municipalities abilty to identify abandoned or refused resources is unknown and recipients typically do not stay in the 
program, having to reapply each month they seek help. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible 
because recipient data related to number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number of recipients 
who return and the frequency of refusal of resources resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
