fiscal year 2017-18 and $10,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 for savings achieved by reduction in the number of background 
checks. Other Special Revenue Funds revenue will also be reduced from fewer background checks by $45,000 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and $27 ,000 in fiscal year 2018-19.

process these background checks. General Fund revenue will decrease by a minor amount from not receiving revenue 
from background check fees.
