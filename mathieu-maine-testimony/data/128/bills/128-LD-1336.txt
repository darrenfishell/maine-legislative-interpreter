withdraw from a regional school unit to request an extension of time to submit  an 25 
agreement to the Commissioner of Education for a period not to exceed 180 days after the 26 
formation of the withdrawal committee.  The withdrawal committee by unanimous vote 27 
may request an extension from the commissioner beyond 180 days after the formati on of 28 
the withdrawal committee.  29 
It allows the withdrawal committee to petition the commissioner to order binding 30 
mediation between the parties if they fail to enter into an agreement within 180 days after 31 
the formation of the withdrawal committee.  The agr eement reached through mediation 32 
must be submitted to the commissioner for approval.  33 
It requires the agreement for the withdrawal of a single municipality from a regional 34 
school unit to include a plan for providing child nutrition services in compliance wi th 35 
state and federal laws at schools operated by the withdrawing municipality and an 36 
anticipated budget for the schools operated by the withdrawing municipality for the first 37
