 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §3026 -A, sub -§2, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 464, §5, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Municipal officers meet to discuss proposed discontinuance and file order of 4 
discontinuance.  The mun icipal officers shall discuss a proposed discontinuance of a 5 
town way or public easement at a public meeting and file an order of discontinuance with 6 
the municipal clerk that specifies:  7 
A.  The location of the town way or public easement;  8 
B.  The names of abutting property owners;  9 
C.  The amount of damages, if any, determined by the municipal officers to be paid to 10 
each abutting property owner; and  11 
D.  Whether or not a public easement is retained.  12 
If a proposal includes the discontinuance of a town way with out retention of a  public 13 
easement, that must be stated explicitly in the order of discontinuance; otherwise, the 14 
public easement is retained.  If a public easement is retained, all other interests of the 15 
municipality in the discontinued way, if any, pass to abutting property owners to the 16 
center of the way  The public easement may not be discontinued if it provides the sole 17 
access to any property.  If a public easement is retained, the purpose for the public 18 
easement must be stated in the order and the muni cipality is responsible for keeping the 19 
easement passable for that purpose .  If a public easement is not retained, all interests of 20 
the municipality in the discontinued way pass to abutting property owners to the center of 21 
the way.  22 
Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §3026 -B is enacted to read:  23 
§3026 -B.  Maintenance of town ways providing access to residential structures  24 
Notwithstanding section 3026 -A, a town may not discontinue a way on which there is 25 
a residential structure if that way is the only way that provides access t o that residential 26 
structure.  A town is required to keep passable for use by motor vehicles a way that is 27 
prevented from being discontinued pursuant to this section.  28 
Sec. 3.  23 MRSA §3028, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 195, is amended to 29 
read:  30 
1.  Presumption of abandonment.   It is prima facie evidence that a town or county 31 
way not kept passable for the use of motor vehicles at the expense of the municipality or 32 
county for a period of 30 or more consecutive years has been discontinued by 33 
abandonment.  A presumption of abandonment may be rebutted by evidence that 34 
manifests a clear intent by the municipality or county and the public to consider or use the 35 
way as if it were a public way or by evidence that there is a residential structure that 36 
depends upo n the way for its sole access as described in section 3026 -B.  A proceeding to 37 
discontinue a town or county way may not prevent or estop a municipality from asserting 38 
a presumption of abandonment.  A municipality or its officials are not liable for 39 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR2244( 01)-1 
 nonperf ormance of a legal duty with respect to such ways if there has been a good faith 1 
reliance on a presumption of abandonment.  Any person affected by a presumption of 2 
abandonment, including the State or a municipality, may seek declaratory relief to finally 3 
resolve the status of such ways.  A way that has been abandoned under this section is 4 
relegated to the same status as it would have had after a discontinuance pursuant to 5 
section 3026, except that this status is at all times subject to an affirmative vote o f the 6 
legislative body of the municipality within which the way lies making that way an 7 
easement for recreational use  3026 -A.  A presumption of abandonment is not rebutted by 8 
evidence that shows isolated acts of maintenance, unless other evidence exists th at shows 9 
a clear intent by the municipality or county to consider or use the way as if it were a 10 
public way.  11 
Sec. 4.  23 MRSA §3201 is amended to read:  12 
§3201.  Removal required; damages  13 
When any ways are  public way is  blocked or encumbered with snow, the r oad 14 
commissioner shall forthwith cause so much of it the snow  to be removed or trodden 15 
down  as will render them  the way  passable. The town may direct the manner of doing it. 16 
In case of sudden injury to public  ways or bridges, he the road commissioner  shall  17 
without delay cause them to be repaired. All damage, accruing to a person in his the 18 
person's  business or property through neglect of such road commissioner or the municipal 19 
officers of such town to so render passable public  ways that are blocked or encum bered 20 
with snow, within a reasonable time, may be recovered of such town by a civil action.  21 
Sec. 5.  23 MRSA §3202 is amended to read:  22 
§3202.  Mail routes; snow fences  23 
There shall be furnished and kept in repair in each section of the town through which 24 
there is a mail route some effectual apparatus for opening ways obstructed by snow, to be 25 
used to break and keep open the way to the width of 10 feet, and the  Wherever there is an 26 
established mail route over a right -of-way held by a municipality, the municip al officers 27 
of the municipality shall ensure that the way is kept safe for the use of the mail carrier 28 
throughout the year in accordance with United States Postal Service regulations.  When 29 
any municipality fails to keep an established mail route safe for the mail carrier, 30 
responsible persons may proceed as provided under sections 3652, 3653 and 3654.  All 31 
damage accruing to a person, business or property through neglect of such municipal 32 
officers to render the way passable for the mail carrier within a rea sonable time may be 33 
recovered of such municipality by a civil action.  The  municipal officers of towns, or any 34 
road commissioner under their direction, may take down fences upon the line of public 35 
highways when they deem  determine  it necessary to prevent t he drifting of snow therein  36 
on those public highways , but they shall  the fences must  in due season be replaced, in as 37 
good condition as when taken down, without expense to the owner.  38

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill prohibits a municipality from discontinuing a road on which there is a 2 
residential structure that depends upon the road for its sole access and requires the 3 
municipality to plow snow from that road and keep it passable.  The bill allows for the 4 
rebuttal of the presumption of abandonment of a public way if the re is a residential 5 
structure that depends on the way for its sole access.  The bill requires municipalities to 6 
maintain mail routes in accordance with United States Postal Service regulations.  7
