Page 1 - 128LR2646(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, current  law subjects certain registered Maine guide applicants  and 
4 registered Maine guides  to duplicative  background check requirements; and
5 Whereas, multiple  background checks  are onerous  for guide applicants and guides  
6 and are  not necessary to ensure public safety; and
7 Whereas, this legislation must take effect  before  the end of the 90-day period  so that 
8 it is in effect  for the  spring and summer tourism season; and
9 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
12 therefore,
13 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
