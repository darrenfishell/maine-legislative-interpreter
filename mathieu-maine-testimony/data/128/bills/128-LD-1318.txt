SUMMARY  6 
This bill changes the amount of money the Department of Transportation pays a 7 
displaced individual due to a property acquisition for a project in which state dollars are 8 
used as funding.  T he bill removes the monetary limit and adds language that would align 9 
Maine with the amount allowed under the most current version of the federal Uniform 10 
Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970.  The bill 11 
applies to payment  for moving and related expenses, replacement housing for 12 
homeowners and replacement housing for tenants and others.  13
