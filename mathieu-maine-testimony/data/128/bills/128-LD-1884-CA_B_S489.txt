SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes and replaces 
the bill. The amendment authorizes a court to order a person admitted to a progressive 
treatment program not to possess firearms, muzzle-loading firearms, bows, crossbows or 
other specified dangerous weapons for the duration of the patient's court-ordered 
participation in the program. Possession of a firearm by a patient in violation of such an 
order is a Class D crime. A law enforcement officer to whom a patient surrenders a 
firearm must exercise reasonable care to avoid loss, damage or reduction in value of the 
surrendered fireann. 
The amendment also directs a court of this State that enters an order dissolving, 
terminating or vacating an order or any portion of an order that constitutes grounds to 
prohibit a person from possessing a firearm pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
15, section 393 to promptly notify the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State 
Police, State Bureau of Identification of this information. The State Bureau of 
Identification is required to then promptly notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
request that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System be promptly 
updated to reflect the dissolution, termination, vacation or modification of the underlying 
order.
