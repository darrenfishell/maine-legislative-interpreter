Page 1 - 128LR2971(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §10111, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2017, c. 282, §3, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 2.  Funding level.  The natural  gas conservation fund, which is a nonlapsing fund, is 
5 established to carry  out the purposes of this section.   The commission shall assess each 
6 gas utility,  in accordance with the triennial  plan,  an amount necessary to capture all 
7 cost-effective energy efficiency that is achievable and reliable for those  consumers who 
8 are eligible to receive  funds  from  the natural gas conservation fund.  The commission 
9 shall direct a gas utility  that collects any portion of the assessment under this subsection 
10 from a customer that is a large- volume  manufacturer to collect the assessment only on the 
11 first 1,000,000 centum cubic  feet of natural gas used by that manufacturer  in each year.  
12 The limitation  on the collection of the assessment  from  large- volume manufacturers may 
13 not affect the trust's determination of the amount necessary to capture all cost- effective 
14 energy efficiency that is achievable and reliable.  The limitation does not limit the 
15 eligibility of a large -volume manufacturer to participate in a natural  gas conservation 
16 program.  All amounts collected under this subsection must be transferred to the natural  
17 gas conservation fund.  Any interest on funds in the fund must be credited to the fund.  
18 Funds not spent in any fiscal  year remain  in the fund to be used for the purposes of this 
19 section.
20 The assessments charged to gas utilities under this section are just and reasonable costs 
21 for rate -making purposes and must be  reflected in the rates  of gas utilities.
22 All funds collected pursuant to this section  are collected under the authority  and for the 
23 purposes of this section and are deemed to be held in trust for the purposes of benefiting  
24 natural gas consumers served by the gas utilities assessed under this subsection.  In the 
25 event funds are not expended or contracted for expenditure within 2 years of being  
26 collected from  consumers, the commission shall  ensure that the value  of those  funds is 
27 returned to consumers.
28 For purposes of this subsection, "large-volume manufacturer" means  a customer that is a 
29 gas utility ratepayer engaged in manufacturing in the State and purchases  at least 
30 1,000,000 centum cubic feet of natural  gas per year.
31 Rules adopted by the commission under this subsection are routine  technical  rules  as 
32 defined in Title 5, chapter  375, subchapter 2-A.
33 Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §10111, sub-§5  is enacted  to read:
34 5.  Use of funds.  All amounts collected under subsection 2 must be transferred  to the 
35 natural gas conservation fund,  referred to in this subsection  as "the fund."   Any interest  on 
36 funds in the fund must  be credited to the fund.  Except  as provided  in paragraph B, funds 
37 not spent  in any  fiscal year remain in the fund to be used for the purposes  of this section.
38 A.  All funds collected pursuant to subsection 2 are collected under  the authority and 
39 for the purposes of this section and are deemed to be held in trust for the purposes of 
40 benefiting natural gas consumers  served  by the gas utilities assessed  under  subsection  
41 2 or potential natural gas consumers of  those gas  utilities as provided in paragraph  B.
Page 2 - 128LR2971(01)-11 B.  Notwithstanding  any provision  of law, rule or commission determination to the 
2 contrary, the trust shall remit  any funds held in the fund more than 2 years after being 
3 collected to gas utilities assessed pursuant to subsection 2.  A gas utility receiving 
4 funds pursuant to this paragraph  may use those funds to assist residential or 
5 commercial consumers or potential consumers in using natural gas for heating.
6 C.  Any funds received by a gas utility  pursuant to paragraph B and not expended or 
7 contracted for the purposes permitted in paragraph B within one year of receipt of 
8 those funds  must be returned to the trust and the commission shall  determine how 
9 those unexpended or uncontracted funds are returned to consumers.
10 The commission may adopt routine technical  rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, 
11 subchapter 2- A to implement the provisions of this subsection.
12 SUMMARY
13 Current law requires the Public Utilities Commission to assess a gas utility an amount 
14 necessary to fund the natural gas conservation fund,  a fund administered by the 
15 Efficiency Maine Trust, which must be used to promote  the efficient use of natural gas.  
16 The assessment may be collected from consumers  of the gas utility.  The commission is 
17 required to return  the value  of any funds collected but not used after 2 years to 
18 consumers.
19 This bill requires  the trust to remit any funds held in the fund more  than 2 years after 
20 being collected to gas utilities.   A gas utility  receiving  such funds may use those funds to 
21 assist residential  or commercial consumers or potential consumers in using natural gas for 
22 heating.  If a utility does not use or contract for the use of such funds within one year of 
23 receipt, the utility must return the funds to the trust and the commission is required to 
24 determine how  to return  those  unexpended funds to consumers.
