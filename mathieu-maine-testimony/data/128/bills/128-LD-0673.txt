 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA ยง664, sub -ยง2, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, ยง2, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 4 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 5 
established in this section .  Starting  except that from  January 1, 2017 to December 31, 6 
2017 , the minimum cash wage paid directly to a tipped service employee may not be less 7 
than $5.00 per hour , and  the tip credit may not exceed the difference between the 8 
minimum cash wage paid directly to a tipped service employee and the minimum hourly 9 
wage established under subsection 1 .  Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January 1st 10 
thereafter, the minimum ca sh wage paid directly to a tipped service employee must be 11 
increased by an additional $1.00 per hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually 12 
adjusted minimum hourly wage established under subsection 1, except that if the 13 
minimum cash wage paid dir ectly to a tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less 14 
than the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage, it must be increased by that lesser 15 
amount.   An employer who elects to use the tip credit , until it is eliminated under this 16 
subsection,  must inform the affected employee in advance and must be able to show that 17 
the employee receives at least the minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip 18 
credit are combined.  Upon a satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's 19 
representative that the actual tips received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall 20 
increase the direct wages by the difference.  21 
The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 22 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automat ically included in the customer's 23 
bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 24 
employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 25 
employee by the next regular payday and may not  be held while the employer is awaiting 26 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  27 
SUMMARY  28 
This bill restores the tip credit to the minimum wage laws.  29
