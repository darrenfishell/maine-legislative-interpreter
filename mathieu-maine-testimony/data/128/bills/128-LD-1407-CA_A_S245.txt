An Act Regarding Prescription Drug Step Therapy 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment "ff,-ls -:;), LI s) 
Committee: Insurance and Financial Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost -All Funds 
The bill has an effective date of January 1, 2019, so only contracts executed after January 1, 2019 will be required to 
meet the coverage in this bill. Thus, the State Employee Health Plan (SEHP) will have no General Fund 
appropriations or Highway Fund allocations in the current biennium. Drug step therapy is the practice of beginning 
drug therapy for a medical condition with the most cost-effective and safest drug and progressing to other more costly 
or risky therapies only if necessary, with the goal of controlling costs and minimizing risks. This bill adds an 
exception process that must be clear, readily accessible and convenient to the patient and prescriber. This could lead 
to additional or longer lasting exceptions from the drug step therapy process, which could potentially increase costs in 
future bienniums for insurers, including the SEHP. However, there is not enough infonnation available to identify a 
fiscal impact at this time.
