1.  Lien.   The lien provided in section 552 must continue for purposes of protecting 26 
the State's deferred tax interest in tax deferred  tax-deferred  property.  When it is 27 
determined that one of the events set out i n section 6259 has occurred and that a property 28 
is no longer eligible for property tax deferral under this chapter, the State Tax Assessor 29 
shall send notice by certified mail to the owner, or the owner's heirs or devisees, listing 30 
the total amount of defer red property taxes, including accrued interest and  costs of all the 31 
years and demanding payment on or before April 30th of the year following the tax year 32 
in which the circumstances causing withdrawal from the provisions of this chapter occur.  33 
When the cir cumstances listed in section 6259, subsection 4 occur, the amount of 34 
deferred taxes is due and payable 5 days before the date of removal of the property from 35 
the State.  36 
If the deferred tax liability of a property has not been satisfied by the April 30th de mand 37 
date, the State Tax Assessor shall, within 30 days, record in the registry of deeds in the 38 
county where the real estate is located a tax lien certificate signed by the State Tax 39

 Page 3 - 128LR1279(01) -1 
 deferred tax liability, a description of the real estate on which the tax was deferred and an 1 
allegation that a tax lien is claimed on the real estate to secure payment of the tax, that a 2

devisees, is the sum of the fees for recording and discharging of the lien as established b y 9 
Title 33, section 751, plus $13.  Upon redemption, the State Tax Assessor shall prepare 10

creates a mortgage on the real estate to the State and has priority over all other mortgages, 14 
liens, attachments and encumbrances of any nature and gives to the State all rights 15 
usually instant  to a mortgage, except that the mortgagee does not have any right of 16 
possession of the real estate until the right of redemption expires.  17

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill reinstates the State's propert y tax deferral program, which was in effect for 2 
applications filed before April 1, 1991.  The bill modifies the program to include 3 
households with at least one individual who is 65 years of age or older or who is retired 4 
from gainful employment due to disa bility and to surviving spouses who are at least 60 5 
years of age or who are retired from gainful employment due to disability and provides 6 
that household income must be less than $40,000.  This limit is indexed for inflation in 7 
2019 and annually thereafter .  The bill also eliminates provisions requiring accrual of 8 
interest on deferred property taxes.  9
