7 This amendment replaces the bill and is the minority report of the committee. Under 
8 this amendment, as directed by a revision clause, the term "marijuana" will be replaced 
9 with the term "cannabis" in the Maine Revised Statutes. This amendment makes the 
10 following changes to the Marijuana Legalization Act, referred to in this summary as "the 
11 Act." 
12 1. It changes provisions in the Act that authorize the state licensing authority, which 
13 is the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, to delegate rulemaking to 
14 other state agencies as cited under the Act to say that the state licensing authority may, or 
15 in some instances must, consult with those agencies regarding rulemaking. 
16 2. It expands the type of retail marijuana licenses that may be established under the 
17 Act to include transportation licenses, delivery services licenses, storage service licenses, 
18 research licenses and special event licenses for on-premises consumption of marijuana. 
19 3. It directs the state licensing authority to ensure that the license privileges 
20 encourage competition with the unregulated marijuana market and allow for small-scale 
21 cultivators and . products manufacturers to have a streamlined application process for 
22 licenses that authorize retail sales directly to consumers. 
23 4. It provides that law enforcement, upon encountering a representative of a retail 
24 marijuana licensee transporting marijuana, must presume that the possession, cultivation 
25 and transportation of the marijuana is legal and in compliance with the Act. This 
26 presumption of lawful possession, cultivation and transportation of marijuana is also 
27 applied to a person 21 years of age or older. 
28 5. It amends the several provisions in the Act that state the Act is not intended to 
29 limit law enforcement authority to investigate unlawful activity related to a retail 
30 marijuana establishment to clarify that law enforcement's role is to investigate only 
31 suspected criminal activity as the Act authorizes the state licensing authority to regulate 
32 retail marijuana licensees for other violations related to the operation of a licensed 
33 establishment. 
34 6. It amends the definition of "plant canopy" to include in the calculation of plant 
35 canopy only those areas in which mature marijuana plants are to be cultivated. 
36 7. It repeals the statewide cultivation cap under the Act and establishes a new 
37 structure for retail marijuana cultivation facility licenses that allows for, among other 
38 cultivation license types, nursery cultivation facilities and small cultivator cooperatives. 
39 8. It requires licenses for licensed retail marijuana establishments and social clubs to 
40 prohibit the licensees from transferring information to an official with the Federal 
Page 44 -128LR2805(03)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEEAMENDMENT6"toH.P.1199,L.D.1719 
1 Government regarding any person who transacts business with the licensees unless 
2 presented with a court order or search warrant. 
3 9. It allows for the consumption of marijuana on the premises of a retail marijuana 
4 store licensee that is not licensed as a social club under a temporary license issued by the 
5 state licensing authority or under a permanent license issued by the state licensing 
6 authority as part of a licensing pilot project. 
7 10. It permits a municipality to impose a licensing fee and a public health and safety 
8 impact fee on marijuana licensees within the municipality and also allows for a local 
9 option sales tax. 
10 11. It specifies that the Act, or rules adopted pursuant to the Act, may not be 
11 construed as altering existing penalties, including those relating to actions such as 
12 operating vehicles while impaired by marijuana, or laws prohibiting furnishing marijuana 
13 to persons under 21 years of age or the possession of marijuana on the grounds of a 
14 public or private school where children attend classes or as altering other similar laws 
15 governing marijuana. 
16 12. It provides protections of parental rights similar to those under the Maine 
17 Medical Use of Marijuana Act pertaining to the lawful possession or consumption of 
18 marijuana. 
19 13. It prohibits a law enforcement officer from engaging in profiling or taking action 
20 resulting from profiling to enforce provisions of the Act. The amendment provides a 
21 definition of profiling. 
22 14. It provides that the Retail Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund must be used 
23 to support public and behavioral health programs and services, including evidence-based 
24 substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, and for training municipal police in 
25 restorative justice and other programs mitigating negative social impacts. 
26 15. It establishes a working group on retail marijuana energy and environmental 
27 standards, the Special Commission on Impaired Driving and the Marijuana Advisory 
28 Commission. It also directs the development of a marijuana research agenda and a craft 
29 marijuana report regarding marijuana industry participation of farmers and businesses of 
30 all sizes. 
31 16. It establishes a retail sales tax rate of 17 .5% on marijuana sold by licensees under 
32 the Act. 
33 17. It requires that rules required under the Act must be provisionally adopted by

costs to review and make confidential all eligible marijuana convictions.

19 to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services to reflect fewer cases of assigned counsel related to 
marijuana offenses. 
Legislature -This bill provides an ongoing appropriation of $4,500 in 2018-19 to the Legislature for the costs of 
legislators serving on the Marijuana Advisory Commission and the Special Commission on Impaired Driving. 
Education, Labor, UMS, MCCS -Additional costs to the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the 
University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System to participate in the development of the 
marijuana research agenda can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
