Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill clarifies requirements for the definition of an ownership or control relationship for purposes of detennining 
when the Department of Health and Human Services may offset debts owed to the department by a provider against 
current MaineCare reimbursement due to that provider or an entity related to that provider. It clarifies that the 
department may not offset current reimbursement owed to an entity related by ownership or control to the provider 
unless the person whose relationship is the subject of the offset has the voting power to govern the operation of the 
provider owing the debt This could potentially lead to debts not being offset, which could increase losses to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. It is not known who these potential pl'oviders are and what debts they may 
have incurred, so no estimate of the potential loss is made at this time.
