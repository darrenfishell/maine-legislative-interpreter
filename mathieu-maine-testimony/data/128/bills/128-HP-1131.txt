 (4-2)  On motion of Representative CHAPMAN of Broo ksville, the following Joint 
Resolution:  (H.P. 1131) 
 
JOINT RESOLUTION MAKING APPLICATION TO THE CONGRESS  OF THE 
UNITED STATES CALLING A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION T O PROPOSE AN 
AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION TO RESO LVE THE 
ISSUE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
 
 WHEREAS, the first president of the United States,  George Washington, stated "The 
basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and alter their Constitutions of 
Government"; and 
 
 WHEREAS, James Madison stated that the Congress of  the United States should be 
"dependent on the people alone"; and 
 
 WHEREAS, that dependency has evolved from a depend ency on the people alone to a 
dependency on those who spend excessively in electi ons or through elections or third-party 
groups; and 
 
 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court ruling in  Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Commission removed restrictions on amounts  of independent political spending; and 
 
 WHEREAS, the removal of those restrictions has res ulted in the unjust influence of 
powerful economic forces, which have supplanted the  will of the people by undermining our 
ability to choose our political leadership, write o ur own laws and determine the fate of our State; 
and 
 
 WHEREAS, under the United States Constitution, Art icle V, the Congress of the United 
States, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall de em it necessary, shall propose amendments 
to the United States Constitution, or, on the appli cation of the legislatures of two-thirds of the 
several states, shall call a convention for proposi ng amendments that, in either case, shall be 
valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the U nited States Constitution, when ratified by the 
legislatures of three-fourths of the several states , or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as 
the one or the other mode of ratification may be pr oposed by the Congress; now, therefore, be it 
 
 RESOLVED: That the Legislature of Maine respectful ly applies to the Congress of the 
United States to call a convention for the specific  and exclusive purpose of proposing an 
amendment to the United States Constitution that ad dresses concerns about the removal of 
restrictions on amounts of independent political sp ending through Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Commission and related cases and events in cluding those occurring long before or 
afterward or for a substantially similar purpose, a nd desires that the requested convention should 
be limited to that purpose; and be it further

 RESOLVED: That this State desires that the delegat es to the requested convention be 
composed equally of individuals currently elected t o state and local office or be selected by 
election in each congressional district for the pur pose of serving as delegates, that all individuals 
elected or appointed to federal office, now or in t he past, be prohibited from serving as delegates 
to the requested convention and that the State inte nds to retain the ability to restrict or expand the  
power of its delegates within the limits expressed in this paragraph; and be it further 
 
 RESOLVED: That this application by this body const itutes a continuing application in 
accordance with the United States Constitution, Art icle V until at least two-thirds of the 
legislatures of the several states have made simila r application pursuant to Article V but, if 
Congress proposes an amendment to the United States  Constitution identical in subject matter to 
that contained in this Joint Resolution, this appli cation for a constitutional convention is no 
longer of any force or effect; and be it further 
 
 RESOLVED: That this application is void, rescinded  and of no effect in the event that 
such a convention is not limited to such a specific  and exclusive purpose; and be it further 
 
 RESOLVED: That this body proposes that the legisla tures of the several states 
composing the United States apply to the Congress r equesting the enactment of appropriate 
amendments to the United States Constitution or req uiring the Congress to call a constitutional 
convention for proposing such amendments to the Uni ted States Constitution; and be it further 
 
 RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution,  duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Secretary of the Se nate and presiding officers of both houses of the 
legislature of each of the several states in the na tion, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, the President and the Secretary of the United States Senate and 
each member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.
