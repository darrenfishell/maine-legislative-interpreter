28 SUMMARY
29 This bill eliminates the requirement  that veterinarians  check prescription monitoring 
30 information under the Controlled Substances Prescription  Monitoring Program  upon 
31 prescribing certain medications, including opioids.  It also changes the continuing 
32 education requirement to require a veterinarian who prescribes opioid medication to 
33 successfully complete 3 hours of continuing education every  2 years on the 
34 administration, prescription and management of controlled substances.   Current law 
35 requires such a veterinarian  to successfully complete 3 hours of continuing education 
36 every 2  years on the  prescription of opioid  medication.
