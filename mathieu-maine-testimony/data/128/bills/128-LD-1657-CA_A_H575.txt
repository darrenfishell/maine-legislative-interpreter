Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the regional greenhouse gas allowances the State can auction each year from 2021 to 2030. It also 
reduces certain "banked allowances" available from 2021 to 2025. These changes could reduce the amount of Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue the Efficiency Maine Trust receives. As this revenue is dependant on future auctions, 
no estimate of the potential revenue loss is available at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Efficiency Maine Trust to administer these changes are anticipated to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
