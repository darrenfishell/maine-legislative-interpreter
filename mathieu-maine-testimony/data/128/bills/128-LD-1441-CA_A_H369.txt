128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 996, L.D. 1441, Bill, "An Act To 
Create Veteran-friendly Workplaces" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 26 MRSA §636, sub-§1, ~ is enacted to read: 
D. "Veteran" means an employee who is a veteran, as defined in section 877, 
subsection 3. 
Sec. 2. 26 MRSA §636, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 455, § 1, is amended to 
read: 
2. Use of paid leave. If an employer, under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement or employment policy, provides paid leave, then the employer shall allow an 
employee to use the paid leave for the care of an immediate family member who is ill as 
provided in this section. An employer who provides paid leave and has 25 or more 
employees shall allow a veteran to take paid leave to attend scheduled appointments at a 
medical facility operated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. If a 
veteran is employed by an employer with fewer than 25 employees, the employer shall 
grant unpaid leave when the veteran provides the employer at least 2 weeks' notice of 
such an appointment whenever possible. For appointments for which the veteran 
provides less than 2 weeks' notice, the employer is not required to grant unpaid leave.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, striking the provisions that require an employer to 
provide a veteran with paid leave for appointments at a medical facility operated by the 
United States Veterans Administration and that establish a program to recognize veteran­
friendly workplaces. The amendment amends cunent law governing family sick leave by 
defining "veteran" and requiring an employer with fewer than 25 employees to allow a 
veteran to take unpaid leave for scheduled appointments at a medical facility operated by 
the United States Depattment of Veterans Affairs when the veteran provides 2 weeks'
