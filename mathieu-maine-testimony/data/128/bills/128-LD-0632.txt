 Preamble. Whereas, Indian tribes and their members have legal status under the 1 
United States Constitution, including under Article 1, Section 8, the Constitution of 2 
Maine, including Article X, Section 5, and various treaties affecting Indian tribes in this  3 
State, including the Treaty of Watertown of 1776; and  4 
Whereas, Maine laws and rules reflect the legal status of Indian tribes, including 5 
provisions relating to child welfare, tribal representation in the Legislature, mortgage 6 
insurance for Indian housing and hunting and fishing rights and privileges; and  7 
Whereas, these Maine laws and rules treat members of a federally recognized 8 
Indian tribe in this State in a manner consistent with the legal status that Indian tribes 9 
possess under the United States Consti tution; and  10 
Whereas, tribal members of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians consider lean 11 
protein, which is preferred to be taken naturally from animals indigenous to the State 12 
such as moose, to be a medicine with important uses and benefits in preventing obesity 13 
and high mortality; now, therefore, be it  14 
Sec. 1.  Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to allocate moose 15 
permits to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians.  Resolved:  That, pursuant to 16 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 11552, t he Commissioner of Inland 17

County.  The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Council  may issue up to 25 of the 20 
moose permits under this section to a person who holds a valid tribal moose permit under 21 
section 2. A tribal moose permit issued by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal 22 
Council under this section must be filed with the com missioner; and be it further  23 
Sec. 2.  Members of Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians exempt from State 24 
moose permit requirements.  Resolved: That a member of the Houlton Band of 25 
Maliseet Indians who is a resident of the State is not required to hold a state p ermit issued 26 
under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, section 11154 to hunt or possess a moose if 27 
that member holds a valid moose permit issued by the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians. 28 
A member of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians issued a tribal per mit pursuant to this 29 
section to hunt and possess moose is subject to all laws and rules applicable to a person 30 
who holds a state license or permit under Title 12, section 11154; and be it further  31
