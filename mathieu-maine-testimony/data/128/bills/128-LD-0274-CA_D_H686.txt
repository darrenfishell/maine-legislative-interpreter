17 22, sections 8302-A and 8302-B be paid for by the Department of Health and Human 
18 Services from the funds available under the federal Child Care and Development Block 
19 Grant Act of 1990, as amended by the federal Personal Responsibility and Work 
20 Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105. It grants 
21 the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to request state and national 
22 criminal history records, including fingerprint-based criminal history records, for certain 
23 child care providers and staff members. 
24 The amendment corrects lettering and numbering problems created by Public Law
