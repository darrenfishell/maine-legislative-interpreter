This bill reduces the number of moose hunting permits issued to nonresidents from 10% to 8% and changes the 
munber issued to hunting outfitters from 10% of the number of permits that exceed 3,140 (not expected to exceed 
3,140 in near future, due to decreased moose population) to 2% of total pennits issued. The bill also directs that if the 
proceeds from the auction of moose hunting permits to fund youth conservation education programs are less than 
$107,000, then the proceeds from moose hunting outfitters pe1mits will be used to make up the difference, with the 
remainder deposited into the Moose Research and Management Fund (MRMF). 
The change to hunting outfitters moose hunting pe1mits will increase the number of these pennits issued and the 
amount of revenue to the MRMF. The reduction in permits issued to nonresidents will decrease General Fund and 
MRMF. Overall, these changes are anticipated to reduce General Fund revenue by an estimated $20,176 and increase 
MRMF Other Special Revenue Funds revenue by an estimated $58,240 annually beginning in fiscal year 2017-18.
