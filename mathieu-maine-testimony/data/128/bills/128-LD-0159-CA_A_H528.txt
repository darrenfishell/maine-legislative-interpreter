Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Prohibiting the Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestiy(ACF) from granting mining leases for the 
mining of massive sulfide ore deposits on state lands would eliminate any potential Other Special Revenue Funds 
(OSRF) revenue to the ACF from application fees and lease royalties. Any costs to the ACF from the lease review 
process would be eliminated as well. The bill would also effectively prohibit the Department of Environmental 
Protection (DEP) from issuing permits for metallic mineral mining under the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act, 
eliminating any potential permit fee revenue from accruing to the Metallic Mining Fund within the DEP and 
eliminating any costs related to DEP's permitting process.
