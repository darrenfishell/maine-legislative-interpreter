 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  18-A MRSA ยง5 -207, sub -ยง(e) is enacted to read:  2 
(e).  If the court finds that compliance with the procedures of this section will likely 3 
result in substantial harm to the minor's health,  safety or welfare and that no other person 4 
appears to have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances, the court, on 5 
petition by a person interested in the minor's welfare, may by order appoint a temporary 6 
guardian whose authority may not excee d 180 days and who may exercise only the 7 
powers specified in the order.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1), reasonable 8 
notice of the time and place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the minor, if the 9 
minor is at least 14 years of ag e, and any other persons as the court directs.  The court 10 
may by order appoint the temporary guardian for up to an additional 180 days after notice 11 
to the minor, if the minor is at least 14 years of age, and any other persons as the court 12 
directs and heari ng on the appointment.  13 
(1).  A temporary guardian may be appointed pursuant to this subsection without 14 
notice to the minor and the minor's parent or legal guardian only if the court finds 15 
from affidavit or testimony that the minor will be substantially har med before a 16 
hearing on the appointment can be held.  If the court appoints a temporary guardian 17 
without notice to the minor's parent or legal guardian, the parent or legal guardian 18 
must be given notice of the appointment within 48 hours after the appointm ent.  The 19 
court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment within 5 days 20 
after the appointment.  21 
(2).  The court may remove a temporary guardian appointed pursuant to this 22 
subsection at any time.  A temporary guardian shall make any repo rt the court 23 
requires.  In other respects, the provisions of this Article concerning guardians apply 24 
to a temporary guardian.  25 
(3).  Parents of a minor are presumed to be acting to protect the minor from 26 
substantial harm to the minor's health, safety and we lfare.  This presumption may be 27 
overcome only by clear and convincing evidence.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill amends the Probate Code to add an expedited process for the court to 30 
appoint a temporary guardian for a minor.  31 
The bill allows the Probate Court to appoint a temporary guardian when a petition is 32 
brought seeking the expedited appointment if the court finds that following the usual 33 
procedure for notice and hearing will likely result in substantial harm to the minor's 34 
health, safety or welfare and that no other p erson appears to have authority and 35 
willingness to act in the circumstances.  The appointment lasts for no more than 180 days.  36 
The temporary guardian has only the powers the court includes in the appointment order.  37 
Reasonable notice about the hearing must  be given to the minor, if the minor is at 38 
least 14 years of age, and to any other persons as the court directs.  A temporary guardian 39 
may be appointed without prior notice only when there is testimony that the minor would 40 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0091(01) -1 
 be substantially harmed before th e hearing on the appointment. In such case, notice must 1 
be given within 48 hours and a hearing held within 5 days.  2 
The court may appoint the temporary guardian for up to an additional 180 days after 3 
notice and hearing.  4 
The bill provides that a temporary gu ardian appointed through this expedited process 5 
remains subject to the other provisions of the Probate Code, Article 5, including the 6 
provisions relating to the duties of guardians.  7 
The bill establishes a presumption that the parents of a minor are acting to protect the 8 
minor's health, safety and welfare.  The presumption can be overcome only by clear and 9 
convincing evidence.  10
