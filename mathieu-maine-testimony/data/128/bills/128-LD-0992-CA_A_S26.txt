This legislation proposes to relocate portions of Park Road and Baileyville Commercial Park from Baring Plantation 
into the Town of Baileyville. Depending upon the property tax mil rate of each municipality and the tax status of each 
entity located in the Park, there could be some shift in tax revenue between Baring Plantation and Bailyville. Both 
entities have voted to proceed with this change.
