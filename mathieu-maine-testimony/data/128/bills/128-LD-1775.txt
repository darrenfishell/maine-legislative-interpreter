Page 1 - 128LR2810(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, implementing a system for the regulation and administration  of the 
4 cultivation, distribution  and retail sale of recreational marijuana, a controlled substance, is 
5 a complex function with significant financial  costs; and
6 Whereas, certain portions of the Marijuana Legalization Act were  delayed until 
7 February 1, 2018 to allow  for the development and  implementation of that system; and
8 Whereas, the  Legislature needs more time to develop that system; and
9 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
10 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
11 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
12 therefore,
13 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
14 Sec. 1.  7 MRSA §2445, first ¶, as amended  by PL 2017, c. 309, §6, is further  
15 amended to read:
16 Beginning February  1, 2018 May 1, 2018, the state licensing authority  shall establish 
17 an independent  testing and certification  program for retail marijuana and retail marijuana 
18 products.  Except  as otherwise  provided  in this section, the program  must  require a retail 
19 marijuana licensee, prior to selling or furnishing  retail marijuana or a retail  marijuana 
20 product to a consumer  or to another licensee, to submit  the marijuana or marijuana 
21 product to a retail  marijuana  testing facility for testing pursuant to this section  to ensure 
22 that the marijuana or marijuana product  does not exceed the maximum level  of allowable 
23 contamination for any contaminant  that is injurious to health and for which testing  is 
24 required and to ensure correct  labeling.   The Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation  
25 and Forestry shall adopt  rules identifying the types of contaminants that are injurious to 
26 health for which marijuana  and marijuana products must  be tested under this section and 
27 the maximum level of allowable contamination for each  contaminant.

35 and furnished by the state licensing authority and must set forth  such information  as the 
36 state licensing authority  may require to enable the state licensing authority  to determine 
37 whether a license  should be granted.  The information must include  the name and address  
38 of the applicant  and the names and addresses of the applicant's officers,  directors  or 
Page 2 - 128LR2810(01)-11 managers.  Each application must be verified by the oath or affirmation of such person  or
