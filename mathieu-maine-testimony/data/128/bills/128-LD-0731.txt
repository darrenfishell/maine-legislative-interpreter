SUMMARY  19 
This bill requires servicers of residential mortgage loans to act in good faith when 20 
dealing with homeowners who are borrowers under those loans. The bill also makes 21 
changes in the  foreclosure mediation process providing that, if courts have previously 22 
sanctioned the conduct of a mortgage servicer in a foreclosure process, the courts are 23 
authorized to directly sanction the mortgage servicer if the mortgage servicer's conduct 24 
evidenc es a failure to mediate in good faith. The bill requires the collection of data on 25 
sanctions imposed to provide that, when a mortgage servicer is found to have failed to act 26 
in good faith, the court may take into account previous conduct in determining a s anction 27 
sufficient to deter such conduct in the same case or future cases.  28
