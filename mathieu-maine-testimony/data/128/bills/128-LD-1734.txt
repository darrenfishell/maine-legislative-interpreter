3 repealed.
4 Sec. 2.  36 MRSA  §1760, sub-§41-A is enacted  to read:
5 41-A.  Certain instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce.  The sale of a 
6 vehicle, railroad  rolling stock, aircraft or watercraft that is placed in use by the purchaser 
7 as an instrumentality  of interstate or foreign commerce within 30 days after that sale and 
8 that is used by the purchaser for not less than 80% of the days of the next 2 years as an 
9 instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce.  The State  Tax Assessor may for good 
10 cause extend for not more than 60 days the time for placing  the instrumentality in use in 
11 interstate or  foreign commerce.
12 For purposes of this subsection:
13 A.  Property  is placed in use as an instrumentality  of interstate or foreign  commerce 
14 by its carrying of, or providing the motive  power for the carrying of, a bona fide 
15 payload in interstate or foreign commerce  or by being dispatched to a specific 
16 location at which  it will be loaded with, or will be used as motive power for the 
17 carrying of,  a bona  fide payload  in interstate or  foreign commerce.
18 (1)  Property  waiting  to be loaded or unloaded or not being used while being 
19 repaired or maintained is considered placed in use as an instrumentality of 
20 interstate or foreign  commerce  as long as its next intended  use is interstate or 
21 foreign commerce.
22 (2)  The days a trailer  is used by another entity  must be used to calculate  
23 eligibility for the exemption  under this subsection as long as there  is a written  
24 transportation agreement between the  2 parties.
25 (3)  Personal property that is a bus with a capacity of at least 47 passengers that is 
26 engaged in transporting  within the State  a bona  fide payload of travelers on an 
27 interstate or foreign cruise that originates outside the State and terminates  outside 
28 the State, if the transportation is provided pursuant to a contract between the 
29 interstate or foreign cruise  provider  and the person providing the transportation, 
30 is considered to be placed  in use as an instrumentality  of interstate or foreign  
31 commerce;
32 B.  "Bona fide payload" means a cargo of persons or property  transported  by a 
33 contract or common carrier for compensation that exceeds the direct  cost of carrying 
34 that cargo or pursuant  to a legal  obligation to provide  service as a public utility or a 
35 cargo of property transported in the reasonable  conduct  of the purchaser's own 
36 nontransportation business in interstate or foreign commerce; and
37 C.  "Interstate  or foreign commerce" has the same meaning  as "interstate commerce"  
38 as defined  in 49 Code  of Federal Regulations, Section  390.5T.
39 The exemption provided  by this subsection is not limited to instrumentalities otherwise 
40 required to be exempt under  the United  States  Constitution.
Page 2 - 128LR2587(01)-11 Sec. 3.  Application to pending investigations  and audits.  Notwithstanding 
2 the Maine  Revised  Statutes,  Title 1, section 302, this Act applies to investigations or 
3 audits conducted  by the Department of Administrative  and Financial  Services, Bureau of 
4 Revenue Services that are  not final as of  the effective date of this Act.
5 SUMMARY
6 This bill clarifies the exemption from sales and use tax for instrumentalities  of 
7 interstate or foreign commerce by specifying that property waiting to be loaded  or 
8 unloaded or not being  used while being  repaired or maintained is considered to be placed 
9 in use in interstate or foreign  commerce  as long as the intended  next use of that property 
10 is interstate  or foreign commerce.  This bill provides  that a trailer  being  used by an entity 
11 other than the owner is eligible for the exemption  as long as there is a written 
12 transportation agreement between the owner and the other  entity.  This bill provides  a 
13 definition of "interstate  or foreign commerce" that is the same as the definition of 
14 "interstate commerce" in the Federal  Motor Carrier  Safety Regulations.   This bill also 
15 specifies that the changes made  in the bill apply  to any ongoing audit or investigation 
16 being conducted by the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau  of 
17 Revenue Services.
