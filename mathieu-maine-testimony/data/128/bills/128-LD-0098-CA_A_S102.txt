turkey allowed by rule during that season. 
Sec. 5. 12 MRSA §11802, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 301, §25, is 
amended to read: 
1. Prohibitions. From September 1st to December 15th and during the spring first

section 11701, subsection 1, a person may not:

attractive to wild turkey. This prohibition does not apply to hunting from an 
observation stand or blind overlooking:

(2) Foods that are left as a result of normal agricultural operations or as a result 
of a natural occurrence.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and eliminates the spring and fall open seasons on 
wild turkey and the bag limits for wild turkey in those seasons. Current law allows the 
Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish open seasons for hunting of 
wild turkey by rule. The amendment prohibits hunting of wild turkey with a crossbow 
from October 1st until the first day of the open season established by the commissioner in 
the following year. The amendment strikes the prohibition on killing or registering wild 
turkey after having killed or registered one wild turkey in any open season of that · 
calendar year and instead prohibits killing or taking more than the number of wild turkey 
allowed during an open season established by rule by the commissioner.
