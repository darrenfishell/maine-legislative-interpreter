COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 635, L.D. 1736 
1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. It repeals the provision in current law that allows 
3 the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Bureau of Maine 
4 Veterans' Services to provide veterans with temporary and emergency assistance and 
5 instead establishes the Veterans Temporary Assistance Fund and prescribes the purposes 
6 for which it may be used within the bureau. The amendment also provides ongoing 
7 funding for the Veterans Temporary Assistance Fund and the Maine National Guard 
8 Postsecondary Fund from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund. 
9 Like the bill, the amendment expands the Maine National Guard Education 
10 Assistance Program to include private nonprofit postsecondary education institutions as 
11 institutions where members of the Maine National Guard may receive a tuition benefit. It 
12 amends the definition of "state postsecondary education institution," which includes the 
13 University of Maine System, the Maine Maritime Academy and the Maine Community 
14 College System, to add private nonprofit postsecondary education institutions in the State 
15 that have registered with the Military Bureau. The amendment requires that private 
16 nonprofit postsecondary education institutions must register with the Military Bureau in 
17 order to take part in the Maine National Guard Education Assistance Program. In the 
18 amendment, the tuition benefit provided by a private nonprofit postsecondary education 
19 institution may not exceed the in-state tuition at the University of Maine at Orono for the 
20 previous academic year. The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations 
21 section.

The bill expands the Maine National Guard Tuition Assistance Program to add private nonprofit postsecondary 
education institutions to state postsecondary education institutions where Maine National Guard members may receive 
a tuition benefit under the program. To the extent that there are sufficient funds available in the Maine National 
Guard Postseconda1y Fund to pay the tuition costs for allMaine National Guard members who want to participate in 
the program, there is no fiscal impact to the higher education institutions. However, if expanding the program results 
in tuition costs exceeding available funding, there would be an impact to the higher education institutions in the fonn 
of lost tuition revenue. 
The bill includes an allocation of $250,000 to the newly established Veterans Temporary Assistance Fund within the 
Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management which will be used for financial assistance to veterans. 
Funding will come from an annual transfer of $250,000 from the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund (LORF) beginning 
in fiscal year 2018-19. 
The bill also includes an allocation of $150,000 to the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund within the 
Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management which will be used for tuition assistance to veterans 
attending state postsecondary education institutions and private postsecondaiy education institutions. Funding will 
come from an annual transfer of $150,000 from the LORF begim1ing in fiscal year 2018-19. 
Increasing from $7,000,000 to $7,400,000 the amount withdrawn annually from the LORF and paid to the State and 
changing the distribution to include the $400,000 described above, will reduce the balance in the LORF. Current law 
requires, once certain revenue bonds have been retired, which is the primary obligation of the LORF, any excess funds 
be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. Since this bill reduces the balance in the LORF by $400,000 
ammally, the final balance available in the LORF to be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund once the 
bonds have been retired will be much lower than under cun-ent law.
