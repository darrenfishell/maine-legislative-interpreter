15 SUMMARY 
16 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill, which requires election clerks in a 
17 municipality to be selected so that 33% of clerks were from one major patiy, 33% from 
18 another major patiy and 34% selected without regard to patiy enrollment. This 
19 amendment amends the process for selection of election clerks and clarifies other 
20 provisions regarding election clerks. 
21 Specifically, the amendment retains the provision in current law allowing patties to 
22 nominate election clerks but also allows the municipal clerk or any registered voter to 
23 make nominations. Like current law, the amendment directs timely consideration of 
24 nominations but does not require municipal officers to appoint the election clerks from 
25 among nominees but allows them to appoint any qualified voter. Under the amendment, 
26 the minimum requirement is 2 election clerks at each voting place, one each from the 2 
27 major patties. Similar to the bill, the amendment requires that at least 1/2 of the election 
28 clerks working at any election are affiliated with the major parties, and the rest of the 
29 election clerks may be affiliated with a minor patiy or be unenrolled. 
30 The amendment also provides that if the municipal officers do not appoint a sufficient 
31 number of election clerks representing the major patties or an insufficient number of 
32 appointees are available to serve from the list provided by municipal officers, the 
33 municipal clerk may appoint additional election clerks without regard to party enrollment 
34 status.
