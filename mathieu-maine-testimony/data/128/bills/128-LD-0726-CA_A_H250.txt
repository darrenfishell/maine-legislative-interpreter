Current law requires a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each fiscal year, up 
to a maximum of3%, be applied to the first $20,000, also indexed to the CPI, of pension benefits received by retired 
state employees, teachers, judges and legislators. This legislation requires that the COLA be applied to the full benefit 
received by the retiree. This will increase both the normal cost and unfunded actuarial liability of the Maine Public 
Employees Retirement System (MainePERS). Pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 18-A, 
unfunded liabilities may not be created except those that result from experience losses. Therefore, any unfunded 
liability created by the provisions in this legislation must be funded immediately. 
Based on estimates provided by the MainePERS, applying the COLA to the full benefit received by a retiree will 
increase required employer contributions during the current biennium by a total of $802,060,000 in fiscal year 2017-
18 and $8,260,000 in fiscal year 2018-19. Of that amount, $2,603,890 and $2,592,000 in fiscal years 2017-18 and 
2018-19, respectively, will be bome by local school administrative units for their share of the normal cost of teacher 
retirement. 
This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $550,000,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 to the Teacher 
Retirement program within the Department of Education for the increased costs to the unfunded actuarial liability of 
the teacher retirement portion of the State Employee and Teacher plan. This bill also includes General Fund 
appropriations of $2,696,110 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $2,808,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the General Purpose Aid 
for Local Schools pro gram for the State's share of the normal cost of teacher retirement. 
LR0879(02) -Fiscal Note -PaQ"e 1 of2 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $246, 7 60,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $2,860,000 in fiscal year 
2018-19 to the Retirement Allowance Fund within the Maine State Retirement System for the increased costs this 
provision is anticipated to have on the normal cost and unfunded actuarial liability of the State employee portion of the 
State Employee and Teacher plan and the Judicial Retirement plan. 
This provision is not expected to result in increased costs to the Legislative Plan due to the actual benefits paid to 
retired legislators being well below the current $20,000 cap.
