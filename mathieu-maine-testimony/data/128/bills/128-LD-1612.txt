SUMMARY  11 
This bill establishes the Universal Fam ily Care Program of universal child care and 12 
in-home and community support services for all individuals and families who are eligible.  13 
Eligibility for universal child care is based on the age of the child, and eligibility for 14 
in-home and community support  services is based on medical eligibility.  Income is not a 15 
factor for eligibility.  The bill establishes the Universal Family Care Trust Fund, which is 16 
managed by a board composed of members who represent child care providers, home 17 
care agencies, employee s of child care providers and home care agencies and consumers 18 
of child care and home care services.  The board employs professional staff and receives 19 
advice from an advisory committee composed of the Commissioner of Health and Human 20 
Services, the Commiss ioner of Education and the Commissioner of Labor as well as the 21 
Treasurer of State, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 22 
Representatives.  Base funding for universal child care is from child care funds from the 23 
Temporary Assistance f or Needy Families program and the federal Child Care and 24 
Development Fund block grant.  Base funding for universal in -home and community 25 
support services is from federal matching funding related to home and community 26 
support services and state funding for elder services provided in the home.  27 
To complete the funding for the Universal Family Care Program, the Department of 28 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services is directed to develop 29 
and submit to the Joint Standing Committee on Hea lth and Human Services draft 30 
legislation to establish universal family care taxes.  The taxes are to be structured to 31 
include 3 elements: a tax on wages that is substantially equivalent to the federal Social 32 
Security's Old -Age, Survivors, and Disability In surance program tax, but that applies 33 
only to earnings above the annual contribution and benefit base of the federal tax; a 34 
self-employment tax applicable to taxpayers who are subject to the federal 35 
Self-Employment Contributions Act tax that is equivalent to that tax and applies to net 36 
earnings above the annual limit subject to taxation under that federal tax; and a tax equal 37 
to the wage and self -employment taxes that is imposed on unearned annual income and 38 
that applies in a manner similar to the federal N et Investment Income Tax.  The bill 39 
directs the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services to report out a bill to 40 
the Second Regular Session of the 128th Legislature to establish universal family care 41 
taxes to fully fund the Universal Family Ca re Program.  42
