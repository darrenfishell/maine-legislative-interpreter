Amend the bill by insetting after section 23 the following:

3. Removal of abandoned ice fishing shacks. A person may not leave a structure

The fee for an antique snowmobile registration is $33. An antique snowmobile

SUMMARY 
This amendment repeals provisions of law that allow hunting with firearms using the 
.22 caliber rimfire caitridge or any autoloading pistol having a barrel less than 8 inches in 
length when the firearm is an automatic fireann or the ca1tridges contain tracer bullets or 
explosive bullets. The amendment removes provisions of the bill affecting turkey bag 
limits and time limits on certain turkey hunting methods. The amendment allows a 
landowner to remove an ice shack placed on the landowner's propetty without permission 
immediately, rather than requiring the landowner to wait 15 days for the ice shack to be 
considered abandoned, which current law requires. The amendment provides that any 
person, rather than residents only, may register a snowmobile that is more than 25 years 
old as an antique snowmobile.
