Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the allocations for funding the total cost of K-12 public education in 2018-2019 including the 
state contribution of$1,115,378,083. Because General Fund appropriations and Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocations totaling this amount for the State's share of funding K-12 public education for fiscal year 2018-19 were 
provided in Public Law 2017, c. 284, the 2018-2019 biennial budget, no additional funding is required. 
The Maine Labor Relations Board may incur additional General Fund costs associated with the collective bargaining 
provisions included in this legislation related to school management and leadership centers. The amount and timing 
of these costs can not be determined at this time.
