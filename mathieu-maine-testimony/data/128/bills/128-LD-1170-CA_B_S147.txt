Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Increasing the legal age to purchase cigarettes and tobacco products from 18 to 21 except for individuals who are 18 
years old as of October 15, 2017 is estimated to reduce General Fund revenue by $2,869,613 in fiscal year 2017-18 
and $3,760,162 in fiscal year 2018-19 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue by $5,293 in fiscal year 2017-18 
and $6,926 in fiscal year 2018-19. These impacts are to the cigarette tax, the tobacco products tax and the sales and 
use tax and assume a 3% decline in cigarette sales and a 5% decline in tobacco product sales adjusted for individuals 
who had attained 18 years of age by October 15, 2017. 
The additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to update materials and resources are expected 
to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
