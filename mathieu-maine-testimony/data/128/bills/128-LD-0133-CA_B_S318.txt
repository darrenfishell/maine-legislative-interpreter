This bill increases the revenue sharing percentage from 2% to 2.125% in fiscal year 2017-18 and to 2.25% in fiscal 
year 2018-19. General Fund revenue would be reduced by $9,895 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $4,165,566 in fiscal 
year 2018-19 and Local Government Fund revenue would be increased by a corresponding amount. It also reduces 
the revenue sharing percentage from 5% to 2.375% in fiscal year 2019-20 and to 2.5% in fiscal year 2020-21 and 
subsequent years, thus increasing General Fund revenues and reducing Local Government Fund revenue.
