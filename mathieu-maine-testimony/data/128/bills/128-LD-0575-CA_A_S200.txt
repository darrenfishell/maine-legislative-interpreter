7 SUMMARY 
8 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill. 
9 The amendment adds to the list of convictions or adjudications that are the basis for 
10 suspending a marine resources license a conviction for committing arson or aggravated 
11 criminal mischief. The amendment makes molesting lobster gear, which is currently a 
12 civil offense, a Class D crime. The amendment provides that fishing 25 or fewer 
13 untagged lobster traps is a civil violation and fishing more than 25 untagged lobster traps 
14 is a Class D crime. 
15 The amendment expands the behavior for which a marine resources license may be 
16 suspended through an administrative process to include setting fire to, sinking or 
17 damaging a lobster boat, conduct that would violate ce1iain provisions of the Maine 
18 Criminal Code and offenses committed against a marine patrol officer or the officer's 
19 family as a result of the officer's performing official duties, regardless of whether that 
20 offensive behavior occurs while unde1iaking an activity for which a marine resources 
21 license is required. The amendment provides for minimum and maximum lengths for 
22 suspension of a marine resources license upon an administrative finding or conviction of 
23 molesting lobster gear, fishing over the lobster trap limit or fishing a sunken trap or trawl 
24 and provides for minimum lengths for suspension for scrubbing lobsters or setting fire to, 
25 sinking or destroying a lobster boat. The amendment allows the Commissioner of Marine 
26 Resources to reduce the number of traps a lobster and crab fishing license holder may fish 
27 following a suspension for one of those offenses. The amendment provides that a 
28 suspension based upon a conviction or adjudication is the same length as an 
29 administrative suspension. 
30 The amendment allows the commissioner to require a person whose lobster and crab 
31 fishing license was suspended for ce1iain offenses to install equipment that allows the 
32 Department of Marine Resources to track the geographic location of the vessel listed on 
33 that person's lobster and crab fishing license for a period immediately following the 
34 reinstatement of the license that may not exceed the duration of the license suspension. 
35 Costs associated with equipment required to be installed must be paid by the license 
36 holder.
