7 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 827, L.D. 1190 
SUMMARY 
This amendment adds a sunset to the bill of October 1, 2021, thus prohibiting driver's 
license suspensions for failure to pay a fine in offenses not related to driving until 
October 1, 2021 and allowing 2 full fiscal years of information about the fiscal effect of 
eliminating driver's license suspension as a tool to collect fines. Without further 
legislative action, the law in effect prior to this Act takes effect on October 1, 2021, 
reinstating the ability of the court to suspend driver's licenses for nonpayment of fines.

This legislation removes, until October 1, 2021, provisions oflaw allowing driver's license suspensions for failure to 
pay a fine in offenses not related to driving. Driver's license reinstatement fees for failure to pay fines accrne 50% to 
the Highway Fund and 50% to the General Fund. Highway Fund and General Fund revenues would be reduced by 
$142,968 in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $190,625 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. Approximately 7,500 of these 
reinstatements are processed annually. This will also reduce General Fund fine revenue collected by the Judicial 
Department by an estimated $150,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $200,000 in fiscal year 2018-19.
