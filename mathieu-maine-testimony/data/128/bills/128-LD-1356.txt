repealed.  2 
Sec. 9.  22 MRSA §4005 -E, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2007, c. 371, §2, is 3 
further amended to read:  4 
1.  Grandparent visitation and access.   A grandparent who is designated as an 5 
interested person or a participant under section 4005 -D or who has been granted 6 
intervenor status under the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 24 may request the 7 
court to grant reasonable rights of visitation or acces s under Title 19 -A, chapter 59 .  8 
When a child is placed in a prospective adoptive home and the prospective adoptive 9 
parents have signed an adoptive placement agreement, a grandparent's right to contact or 10 
have access to the child that was granted pursuant to this chapter is suspended.  If the 11 
adoption is not final within 18 months of adoptive placement, then the grandparent whose 12 
rights of contact or access were suspended pursuant to this subsection may resume, as a 13 
matter of right and without further court  order, contact with the child in accordance with 14 
the order granting that contact or access, unless the court determines after a hearing that 15 
the contact is not in the child's best interests.  A grandparent's rights of visitation or 16 
access terminate when t he adoption is finalized pursuant to Title 18 -A, section 9 -308.  17 
Nothing in this section prohibits prospective adoptive parents from independently 18 
facilitating or permitting contact between a child and a grandparent, especially when a 19 
court has previously ordered rights of contact.  20
