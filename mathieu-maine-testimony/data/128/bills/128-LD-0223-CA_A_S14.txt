10 Determine When the Remains of Deceased Persons May Be Considered Abandoned" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'An Act To Ensure the Timely Final Disposition of Human Remains' 
13 Amend the bill in section 1 in subsection 2 by inserting after the first blocked 
14 paragraph (page 1, lines 16 to 19 in L.D.) a new blocked paragraph to read: 
15 'If a person who has custody and control under this subsection does not complete decision 
16 making regarding final disposition within 30 days after taking custody and control, a 
17 funeral director or practitioner of funeral service who has physical possession of the 
18 remains or dead body may bury the remains or dead body at the expense of the funeral 
19 director or practitioner.' 
20 Amend the bill in section 1 in subsection 2 in the last blocked paragraph in the 2nd 
21 and 3rd lines (page 1, lines 29 and 30 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "or if the 
22 person who has custody and control does not make a decision regarding disposition 
23 within 3 0 days" 
24 SUMMARY 
25 This amendment removes the provision in the bill regarding when remains or a dead 
26 body is considered abandoned and changes the title. It provides that a funeral director or 
27 practitioner may bury remains or a dead body if the person who has custody and control 
28 of the remains or dead body does not complete decision making regarding final 
29 disposition within 30 days of the person taking custody or control.
