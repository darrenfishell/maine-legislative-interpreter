This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment requires 
health insurance carriers to provide coverage for an ultrasound evaluation, a magnetic 
resonance imaging scan, 3-dimensional mammography or additional testing of an entire 
breast or breasts after a baseline mammogram examination if the mammogram results 
demonstrate dense breast tissue or are abnormal within any degree of breast density or if 
the person has certain risk factors for breast cancer. The bill limits coverage to a magnetic 
resonance imaging scan. The requirements apply to all individual and group policies and 
contracts issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2019. The amendment also adds 
language exempting the bill from the provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 24-

The bill has an effective date of January 1, 2019, so only contracts executed after January 1, 2019 will be required to 
meet the coverage in this bill. Thus, the State Employee Health Plan will require no General Fund appropriations or 
Highway Fund allocations in the current biennium. It is estimated that this bill will have an annual impact of $55 ,3 89 
to the General Fund and $1,654 to the Highway Fund for the increased costs for coverage of additional breast cancer 
screening beginning on July 1, 2019.
