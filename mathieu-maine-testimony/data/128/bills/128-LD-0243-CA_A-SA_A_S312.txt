Despite containing emergency language in this bill, the end of fiscal year 2016-17 will arrive before the spending 
envisioned by the bill can occur. This amendment moves the appropriations and allocations authorized in fiscal year 
2016-17 to fiscal year 2017-18 except for a $500 allocation which will still be needed in fiscal year 2016-17 to 
establish the newly created Retail Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund. As amended, the $1,400,000 transfer 
from the General Fund to the new fund will still occur in fiscal year 2016-17 and the funding will carry forward to be 
spent in fiscal year 2017-18.
