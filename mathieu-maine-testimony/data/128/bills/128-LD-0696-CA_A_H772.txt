B. Provide exceptions to the formulary limitation when a nonformulary alternative is 
medically indicated, consistent with the utilization review standards in section 4304.~ 
C. Provide an enrollee with at least 60 days' written notice of an adverse change to a 
formulary, except that a carrier may provide less than 60 days' notice when a

safety. The notice must use a conspicuous font and inform the enrollee of the adverse 
change to the formulary and advise the enrollee to consult with the enrollee's provider

request is submitted prior to the effective date of the change, a carrier shall continue to 
provide coverage for that drng until the carrier has rendered a decision on an enrollee's
