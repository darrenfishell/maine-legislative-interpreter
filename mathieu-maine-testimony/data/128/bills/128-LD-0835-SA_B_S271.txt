Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
This amendment removes meat, poultry, and fish from the definition of "farm food product". The removal of certain 
products from the definition of a "farm food product" would subject the producers of those products to the licensing 
and inspection requirements of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Revenue from issuing these 
licenses will increase General Fund revenue by a minor amount.
