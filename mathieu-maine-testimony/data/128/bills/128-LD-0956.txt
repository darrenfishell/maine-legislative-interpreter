SUMMARY  19 
This bill establishes the Maine Buy America and Build Maine Act and requires that 20 
all contracts for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or 21 
maintenance of a public building or pu blic work made by a state agency, board, 22 
commission or institution contain a provision that the manufactured goods, including iron 23 
and steel, used or supplied in the performance of the contract or any subcontract to the 24 
contract must be manufactured in the  United States.  This requirement does not apply to 25 
counties, municipalities or school administrative units.  26 
The bill requires that, in the case of a manufactured good other than an iron or steel 27 
product, all of the manufacturing processes take place in th e United States and the origin 28 
of the manufactured good's components or subcomponents meet a minimum level of 29 
domestic content as established by rule.  30 
Under the Act, a public agency may apply to the Governor or the Governor's designee 31 
for a waiver of the r equirement if the executive head of the public agency finds that the 32 
application of the requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest, that the 33 
necessary manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and 34 
reasonably ava ilable quantities and of a satisfactory quality or that inclusion of 35 
manufactured goods made in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project 36 
contract by an unreasonable amount.  The Department of Administrative and Financial 37 
Services is directed to develop rules regarding the Act, including rules to guide the 38 
waiver process and the process for public review and comment regarding requests for a 39 
waiver.  40 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0457(0 1)-1 
 The bill requires that if the Department of Administrative and Financial Services has 1 
reason to believe that any person, business or other entity has intentionally made 2 
fraudulent representations about the domestic content of a manufactured good or has 3 
intentionally violated any provision of the Act, the department must, after a hearing, 4 
deba r that person, business or other entity from contracts or subcontracts with the State 5 
for 2 years.  6 
The bill provides that the provisions of this legislation must be applied in a manner 7 
consistent with the State's obligations under any applicable internatio nal agreements 8 
pertaining to government procurement.  9 
The bill also requires that, in the award of a bid for the construction, reconstruction, 10 
alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of a public building or public work or for 11 
services to be provided to or on behalf of the State, if 2 or more bids are submitted that 12 
are substantially similar, preference must be given to the bid submitted by an in -state 13 
contractor.  If the bid submitted by an in -state contractor is higher than the lowest bid 14 
submitted b y a contractor that is not an in -state contractor, the in -state contractor must be 15 
given the opportunity to match the lowest bid submitted.  16
