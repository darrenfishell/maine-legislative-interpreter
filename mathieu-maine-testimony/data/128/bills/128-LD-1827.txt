Page 1 - 128LR2806(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  18-B MRSA §105, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 42, §4, is further  
3 amended to read:
4 3.  Waiver or modification.   The settlor,  in the trust instrument or in another writing 
5 delivered to the trustee, may waive or modify  the duties  of a trustee under section 813, 
6 subsection 1 or, 2 or 3 to give notice, information and reports  to qualified beneficiaries in 
7 either or  both of the following  ways:
8 A.  Waiving or modifying such duties  as to all qualified beneficiaries except the 
9 settlor's surviving  spouse during the lifetime of the settlor or the lifetime of the 
10 settlor's surviving spouse; and
11 B.  With respect to one or more of the current beneficiaries  as to whom the settlor  has 
12 waived or modified such duties, designating a person or persons, any of whom may 
13 or may not be a beneficiary,  to act in good faith to protect the interests of the current 
14 beneficiaries who are not receiving notice, information or reports  and to receive any 
15 notice, information or reports required under section 813, subsection  1 or, 2 or 3 in 
16 lieu of providing  such notice, information or reports to the current beneficiaries.  The 
17 person or persons designated under this paragraph  are deemed to be representatives  
18 of the current beneficiaries not receiving notice, information or reports for the 
19 purposes of the time limitation for a beneficiary to commence  an action against  the 
20 trustee for breach of trust as  provided in section 1005, subsection 1.
21 Sec. 2.  18-B MRSA §813,  sub-§6,  as enacted  by PL 2011, c. 42, §7, is amended 
22 to read:
23 6.  Duty to settlor of revocable trust. During the lifetime of the settlor of a 
24 revocable trust,  whether or not the settlor has capacity to revoke  the trust, the trustee's 
25 duties under this section  are owed exclusively  to the settlor and the trustee  has no duty to 
26 provide information  or reports to distributees, permissible distributees  or qualified  
27 beneficiaries. If the settlor lacks capacity to revoke the trust, a trustee may satisfy the 
28 trustee's duties under this section  by providing  information  and reports  to any one or more 
29 of the following in the  order of  preference listed:
30 A.  The person  or persons designated  by the settlor in the trust to receive information 
31 and reports  on the  settlor's  behalf;
32 B.  The settlor's spouse or registered domestic  partner under Title 22, section 2710;
33 C.  The settlor's agent under a durable  power  of attorney;
34 D.  The  settlor's court-appointed conservator; or
35 E.  The settlor's court-appointed guardian.
36 If the settlor lacks capacity to revoke  the trust and there are no persons listed in this 
37 subsection to whom the trustee may provide information and reports,  the trustee shall 
38 satisfy its duties under this section by providing information and reports to the qualified 
39 beneficiaries.
Page 2 - 128LR2806(01)-11 SUMMARY
2 This bill amends the Maine  Uniform Trust Code  in 2 ways.  First, it corrects a gap in 
3 the statute governing a trustee's  duties with regard to reporting to a beneficiary  or another  
4 person designated by the trust's settlor.  The correction allows the trustee  to carry out the 
5 settlor's directions  without violating the duty established  by statute.  Second, this bill 
6 corrects an ambiguity with regard to the duty the trustee owes to the settlor  of a revocable 
7 trust during the settlor's lifetime, clarifying that the trustee has no duty to provide 
8 information and reports to distributees, permissible distributees or qualified  beneficiaries  
9 while the settlor is alive.
