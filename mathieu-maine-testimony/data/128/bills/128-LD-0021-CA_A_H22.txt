Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill exempts nonprofit hospitals from the requirement that organizations that assist parents or guardians with the 
process of executing a power of attorney for the temporary care of a minor ensure that a background check is 
completed for the agent and any adult members of the agent's household, which should reduce the number of 
screenings for child and adult abuse, neglect or exploitation obtained through the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS). Any savings to DHHS from the changes in this bill are expected to be minor.
