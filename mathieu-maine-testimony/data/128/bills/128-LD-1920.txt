Page 1 - 128LR3077(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง4008, sub-ยง5, as amended by PL 2015, c. 501, ยง1, is repealed 
3 and the following enacted in its place:
4 5.  Retention of child protective services records; use.  The department may retain 
5 child protective services case records created under this chapter.  Following  a finding of 
6 unsubstantiation, the department may not publicly disclose  information in the 
7 unsubstantiated record, except that information in any record, including an 
8 unsubstantiated record, may be admitted into evidence  in an administrative or judicial  
9 proceeding.
10 SUMMARY
11 Current law requires the Department of Health and Human Services  to expunge  a 
12 record of a child protective services case for which there was a finding that the 
13 allegations were unsubstantiated  after 18 months  and prohibits the use of an expunged  
14 record for any purpose.
15 This bill allows the department to retain all records  created under  the Child and 
16 Family Services and Child Protection Act.  The department may not publicly  disclose 
17 information in an unsubstantiated record, but may allow information in any record to be 
18 introduced into evidence in an administrative or  judicial proceeding.
