The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill increases the homestead property tax exemption from $20,000 to $50,000 for certain applicants age 75 or 
older and provides for 100% reimbursement to municipalities for this increase for property tax years beginning on or 
after April 1, 2018. The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $15,460,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the 
Depattment of Administrative and Financial Services, $15,375,000 of which is to reimburse municipalities for the los 
of property tax revenue and $85,000 of which is for a one-time reimbursement to municipalities for the mandated 
costs to make the resulting changes to the program.
