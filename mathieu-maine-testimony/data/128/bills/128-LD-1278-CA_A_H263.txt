Redefining stepchild could result in increased tuition waivers, therefore reducing revenue to state colleges and 
universities. No estimate of this potential reduction is made at this time. 
The bill provides that pay and allowances to members called to active service can be paid from the Armory Rental 
Fund within the Department of Defense and Veterans Services, which could reduce General Fund costs. It also allows 
the department to waive rental fees of property for certain organizations, potentially reducing Other Special Revenue 
Funds revenue. No change to the budget is required from either of these provisions ..
