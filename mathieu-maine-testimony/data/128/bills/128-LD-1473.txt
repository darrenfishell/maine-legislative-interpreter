2.  Toxic or hazardous substances.  Any other toxic substance in any amount or 24 
concentration greater than that identified or regulated, including complete prohibition of 25 
such substance, by the board  department . In identifying and regu lating such toxic 26 
substances, the board  department  shall take into account the toxicity of the substance, its 27 
persistence and degradability, the usual or potential presence of any organism affected by 28 
such substance in any waters of the State, the importan ce of such organism and the nature 29 
and extent of the effect of such substance on such organisms, either alone or in 30 
combination with substances already in the receiving waters or the discharge. As used in 31 
this subsection, "toxic substance" shall mean  means  those substances or combination of 32 
substances, including disease causing  disease -causing  agents, which  that after discharge 33 
or upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation or assimilation into any organism, including 34 
humans either directly through the environment  or indirectly through ingestion through 35 
food chains, will, on the basis of information available to the board  department  either 36 
alone or in combination with other substances already in the receiving waters or the 37 
discharge, cause death, disease, abnormali ties, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological 38 
malfunctions, including malfunctions in reproduction, or physical deformations in such 39 
organism or their its offspring.  40 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR0736(01) -1 
 A.  Except as naturally occurs or as provided in paragraphs B and C, the board  1 
department  shall regulate toxic substances in the surface waters of the State at the 2 
levels set forth in federal water quality criteria as established by the United States 3 
Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control 4 
Act, Public La w 92 -500, Section 304(a), as amended.  5 
B.  The board  department  may change the statewide criteria established under 6 
paragraph A for a particular toxic substance established pursuant to the Federal Water 7 
Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92 -500, Section 304( a), as amended, as follows:  8 
(1)  By adopting site -specific numerical criteria for the toxic substance to reflect 9 
site-specific circumstances different from those used in, or any not considered in, 10 
the derivation of the statewide criteria.  The board  depart ment  shall adopt site - 11 
specific numerical criteria only as part of a licensing proceeding pursuant to 12 
sections 413, 414 and 414 -A; or  13 
(2)  By adopting alternative statewide criteria for the toxic substance.  The 14 
alternative statewide criteria must be adopte d by rule.  15 
The board  department  may substitute site -specific criteria or alternative statewide 16 
criteria for the criteria established in paragraph A only upon a finding that the site - 17 
specific criteria or alternative statewide criteria are based on sound sci entific rationale 18 
and are protective of the most sensitive designated use of the water body, including, 19 
but not limited to, human consumption of fish and drinking water supply after 20 
treatment.  21 
C.  When surface water quality standards are not being met due to the presence of a 22 
toxic substance for which no water quality criteria have been established pursuant to 23 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 304(a), as amended, the board  24 
department  shall:  25 
(1)  Adopt statewide numerical criteria by rule; or  26 
(2)  Adopt site -specific numerical criteria as part of a licensing proceeding under 27 
sections 413, 414 and 414 -A. 28 
Nothing in this section restricts the authority of the board  department  to adopt, by 29 
rule, statewide or site -specific numerical criteria for to xic substances that are not 30 
presently causing water quality standards to be violated.  31 
D.  For any criteria established under this subsection, the board  department  shall 32 
establish the acceptable level of additional risk of cancer to be borne by the affected  33 
population from exposure to the toxic substance believed to be carcinogenic.  34 
E.  In regulating substances that are toxic to humans, including any rulemaking to 35 
regulate these substances, the board  department  shall consider any information 36 
provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.  37 
F.  The Department of Health and Human Services may request that the board  38 
department  adopt or revise the statewide or site -specific criteria for any toxic 39 
substance based on the need to protect public health.  If t he request is filed with the 40 
board  department , the board  department  may propose a rule and initiate a rule - 41 
making proceeding.  The board  department  shall incorporate in its proposal for 42 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0736(01) -1 
 rulemaking under this paragraph the statewide or site -specific criteri a recommended 1 
by the Department of Health and Human Services.  2 
G.  Numeric water quality criteria for 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin 3 
established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal 4 
Water Pollution Control Act, Publ ic Law 92 -500, Section 304(a), as amended, do not 5 
apply until June 1, 1991, and only apply on that date if the board  department  has not 6 
adopted through rulemaking or individual licensing proceedings under this section 7 
alternative numeric water quality crit eria for 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin.  8 
Pursuant to section 414 -A, subsection 2, the board  department  shall establish 9 
schedules for compliance with criteria established under this section.  These 10 
schedules must be consistent with the compliance d eadlines established under the 11 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Public Law 92 -500, Section 304(l), as amended.  12 
H.  Notwithstanding paragraphs D and G, the board  department  may not adopt any 13 
numeric water quality criteria for, or acceptable level of add itional cancer risk from 14 
exposure to, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin prior to January 1, 1994.  15 
I.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following standards apply 16 
only to a bleach kraft pulp mill, referred to in this paragraph as  a "mill."  17 
(1)  After July 31, 1998, a mill may not have a detectable quantity of 2, 3, 7, 8 - 18 
tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin as measured in any internal waste stream of its 19 
bleach plant.  For purposes of compliance, the detection level is 10 picograms per 20 
liter, unless the department adopts a lower detection level by rule, which is a 21 
routine technical rule pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, or a lower 22 
detection level by incorporation of a method in use by the United States 23 
Environmental Protectio n Agency.  24 
(2)  After December 31, 1999, a mill may not have a detectable quantity of 2, 3, 25 
7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo -p-furan as measured in any internal waste stream of its 26 
bleach plant.  The commissioner may extend this time frame up to 6 months for a 27 
mill if the commissioner determines, based on information presented by the mill, 28 
that compliance is not achievable by the deadline due to engineering constraints, 29 
availability of equipment or other justifiable technical reasons.  For purposes of 30 
compliance, the  detection level is 10 picograms per liter, unless the department 31 
adopts a lower level of detection by rule, which is a routine technical rule 32 
pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, or a lower detection level by 33 
incorporation of a method in use by the United States Environmental Protection 34 
Agency.  If a mill fails to achieve this requirement, as documented by 35 
confirmatory sampling, it shall conduct a site -specific evaluation of feasible 36 
technologies or measures to achieve it.  This evaluation mus t be submitted to the 37 
commissioner within 6 months of the date of confirmatory sampling and include 38 
a timetable for implementation, acceptable to the commissioner, with an 39 
implementation date no later than December 31, 2002.  The commissioner may 40 
establish  a procedure for confirmatory sampling.  41 
(3)  After December 31, 2002, a mill may not discharge dioxin into its receiving 42 
waters.  For purposes of this subparagraph, a mill is considered to have 43 
discharged dioxin into its receiving waters if 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p- 44 
dioxin or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-furan is detected in any of the mill's 45 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0736(01) -1 
 internal waste streams of its bleach plant and in a confirmatory sample at levels 1 
exceeding 10 picograms per liter, unless the department adopts a lower detec tion 2 
level by rule, which is a routine technical rule pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, 3 
subchapter 2 -A, or a lower detection level by incorporation of a method in use by 4 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or if levels of dioxin, as 5 
defined in section 420 -B, subsection 1 -A, paragraph A detected in fish tissue 6 
sampled below the mill's wastewater outfall are higher than levels in fish tissue 7 
sampled at an upstream reference site not affected by the mill's discharge or on 8 
the basis of a comparab le surrogate procedure acceptable to the commissioner.  9 
The commissioner shall consult with the technical advisory group established in 10 
section 420 -B, subsection 1, paragraph B, subparagraph (5) in making this 11 
determination and in evaluating surrogate proc edures.  The fish -tissue sampling 12 
test must be performed with differences between the average concentrations of 13 
dioxin in the fish samples taken upstream and downstream from the mill 14 
measured with at least 95% statistical confidence.  If the mill fails to meet the 15 
fish-tissue sampling -result requirements in this subparagraph and does not 16 
demonstrate by December 31, 2004 and annually thereafter to the commissioner's 17 
satisfaction that its wastewater discharge is not the source of elevated dioxin 18 
concentration s in fish below the mill, then the commissioner may pursue any 19 
remedy authorized by law.  20 
(4)  For purposes of documenting compliance with subparagraphs (1) and (2) the 21 
internal waste stream of a bleach plant must be sampled twice per quarter by the 22 
mill.  The department may conduct its own sampling and analysis of the internal 23 
waste stream of a bleach plant.  Analysis of the samples must be conducted by a 24 
3rd-party laboratory using methodology approved by the United States 25 
Environmental Protection Agency.  A mill shall report to the department for 26 
informational purposes the actual laboratory results including sample detection 27 
limits on a frequency to be established by the commissioner.  28 
The commissioner shall assess the mill for the costs of any sampling perf ormed 29 
by the department and any analysis performed for the department under this 30 
paragraph and credit funds received to the Maine Environmental Protection Fund.  31 
The commissioner may reduce the frequency of sampling required by a mill after 32 
3 consecutive ye ars of sampling have demonstrated the mill does not have a 33 
detectable quantity of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin or 2, 3, 7, 8 - 34 
tetrachlorodibenzo -p-furan.  35 
J.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the department shall 36 
use a on e in 10,000 risk level when calculating ambient water quality criteria for 37 
inorganic arsenic.  38 
Sec. A -11.  38 MRSA §490 -Y, first ¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 297, §9, is 39 
further amended to read:  40

submitted on forms approved by the department and mailed to the municipality where the 2 
quarry is located, the department, the Maine Histor ic Preservation Commission and each 3 
abutting property owner.  The notice that is mailed to the municipality and each abutting 4 
property owner must be sent by certified mail at least 7 days before the notice of intent to 5 
comply is filed with the regulator.  The notice that is mailed to the department must be 6 
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.  Upon receiving the postal receipt, the 7 
owner or operator may commence operation of the quarry.  The municipality where the 8 
proposed quarry is located may  submit comments to the department if the proposed 9 
quarry may pose an unreasonable adverse impact under the standards in section 490 -Z.  10 
Within 30 days of receipt of the notice of intent to comply, the department shall respond 11 
to the comments made by the m unicipality.  Abutting property owners, the Maine 12 
Historic Preservation Commission or other interested persons may submit comments 13

The department shall have one standard for the classification both of great ponds and 4 
of natural lakes and ponds less than 10 acres in size.  Impoundments of rivers that are 5 
defined as great pond s pursuant to section 480 -B are classified as GPA or as specifically 6 
provided in sections 467 and 468.  7 
Sec. B -2.  38 MRSA §465 -A, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2013, c. 193, §4, is 8 
further amended to read:  9 
1.  Class GPA waters.   Class GPA shall be  is the sole c lassification both of great 10 
ponds and of natural lakes and  ponds and lakes  less than 10 acres in size.  11 
A.  Class GPA waters must be of such quality that they are suitable for the designated 12 
uses of drinking water after disinfection, recreation in and on t he water, fishing, 13 
agriculture, industrial process and cooling water supply, hydroelectric power 14 
generation, navigation and as habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  The habitat must 15 
be characterized as natural.  16 
B.  Class GPA waters must be described by  their trophic state based on measures of 17 
the chlorophyll "a" content, Secchi disk transparency, total phosphorus content and 18 
other appropriate criteria. Class GPA waters must have a stable or decreasing trophic 19 
state, subject only to natural fluctuations , and must be free of culturally induced algal 20 
blooms that impair their use and enjoyment.  The number of Escherichia coli bacteria 21 
of human and domestic animal origin in these waters may not exceed a geometric 22 
mean of 29 per 100 milliliters or an instantan eous level of 194 per 100 milliliters.  23 
C.  There may be no new direct discharge of pollutants into Class GPA waters.  The 24 
following are exempt from this provision:  25 
(1)  Chemical discharges for the purpose of restoring water quality approved by 26 
the departme nt; 27 
(2)  Aquatic pesticide or chemical discharges approved by the department and 28 
conducted by the department, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or 29 
an agent of either agency for the purpose of restoring biological communities 30 
affected by an in vasive species;  31 
(3)  Storm water discharges that are in compliance with state and local 32 
requirements;  33 
(4)  Discharges of aquatic pesticides approved by the department for the control 34 
of mosquito -borne diseases in the interest of public health and safety using 35 
materials and methods that provide for protection of nontarget species.  When the 36 
department issues a license for the discharge of aquatic pesticides authorized 37 
under this subparagraph, the department shall notify the municipality in which 38 
the applic ation is licensed to occur and post the notice on the department's 39 
publicly accessible website; and  40 
 
 Page 9 - 128LR0736(01) -1 
 (5)  Discharges of pesticides approved by the department that are:  1 
(a)  Unintended and an incidental result of the spraying of pesticides;  2 
(b)  Applied in c ompliance with federal labeling restrictions; and  3 
(c)  Applied in compliance with statute, Board of Pesticides Control rules and 4 
best management practices.  5 
Discharges into these waters licensed prior to January 1, 1986 are allowed to continue 6 
only until pr actical alternatives exist.  Materials may not be placed on or removed 7 
from the shores or banks of a Class GPA water body in such a manner that materials 8 
may fall or be washed into the water or that contaminated drainage may flow or leach 9 
into those waters , except as permitted pursuant to section 480 -C.  A change of land 10 
use in the watershed of a Class GPA water body may not, by itself or in combination 11 
with other activities, cause water quality degradation that impairs the characteristics 12 
and designated us es of downstream GPA waters or causes an increase in the trophic 13 
state of those GPA waters.  14 
Sec. B -3.  38 MRSA §467, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2005, c. 330, §11, is 15
