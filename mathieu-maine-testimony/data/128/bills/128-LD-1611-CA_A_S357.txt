Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill will establish an industrial hemp pilot program to allow educational institutions and others to cultivate, 
process and distribute industrial hemp for research purposes under a license issued by the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (ACF). The bill also directs the department to create an industrial hemp seed certification 
program in conjunction with the new pilot program licensure requirements. 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $36,490 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Division of Quality Assurance 
and Regulation program within ACF for one part-time Certified Seed Specialist position and All Other costs to 
administer the seed certification program. Because the pilot program is limited to research activities involving 
industrial hemp production, it is estimated that there will be a limited number of program participants generating 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $12,500 starting in fiscal year 2018-19. 
This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of$50,000 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Educational and General 
Activities -UMS program within the University of Maine System for the costs associated with the University of 
Maine providing research, outreach, product development and testing services to participants of an industrial hemp 
pilot program. The System estimates an annual cost of $50,000 for each year of the 5-year pilot program.
