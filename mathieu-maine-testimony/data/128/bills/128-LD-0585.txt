3.  Qualifying contributions.   Participating candidates must obtain qualifying 9

A.  For a gubernatorial candidate, at least 3,200 verified registered voters of this State 11 
must support the candidacy by  providing a qualifying contribution to that candidate;  12 
B.  For a candidate for the State Senate, at least 175 verified registered voters from 13 
the candidate's electoral division must support the candidacy by providing a 14 
qualifying contribution to that cand idate; or  15 
C.  For a candidate for the State House of Representatives, at least 60 verified 16 
registered voters from the candidate's electoral division must support the candidacy 17 
by providing a qualifying contribution to that candidate.  18 
A payment, gift or any thing of value may not be given in exchange for a qualifying 19 
contribution.  A candidate may pay the fee for a money order that is a qualifying 20 
contribution in the amount of $5 as long as the donor making the qualifying contribution 21 
pays the $5 amount refle cted on the money order.  Any money order fees paid by a 22 
participating candidate must be paid for with seed money and reported in accordance with 23 
commission rules.  A money order must be signed by the contributor to be a valid 24 
qualifying contribution.  For qualifying contributions made in cash, in order to be a valid 25 
contribution, the candidate shall ensure that the contributor attests, by signing a receipt 26 
and acknowledgment form designed by the commission, that the contributor made the 27 
contribution using the contributor's own funds and received nothing in return for making 28 
the qualifying contribution.  In lieu of submitting the cash to the commission, the 29 
candidate shall submit a check payable to the Maine Clean Election Fund in an amount 30 
equal to cash con tributions listed on the receipt and acknowledgment form to the 31 
commission.   The commission may establish by routine technical rule, adopted in 32 
accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, a procedure for a qualifying 33 
contribution to be made by a credit or debit transaction and by electronic funds transfer 34 
over the Internet. Records containing information provided by individuals who have 35 
made qualifying contributions over the Internet are confidential, except for the name of 36 
the individual making t he contribution, the date of the contribution, the individual's 37 
residential address and the name and office sought of the candidate in whose support the 38 
contribution was made.  39 
It is a violation of this chapter for a participating candidate or an agent of t he participating 40 
candidate to misrepresent the purpose of soliciting qualifying contributions and obtaining 41 
the contributor's signed acknowledgement  acknowledgment . 42

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill amends the definition of "qualifying contribution" under the Maine Clean 2 
Election Act to include $5 cash contributions in addition to those made by check or 3 
money order or via the Internet.  Current law defines a qualifying contribution as a 4 
contribution in the amount of $5 or more.  This bill limits the contribution to $5.  Th e bill 5 
also provides a process to ensure that qualifying contributions made in cash are valid 6 
contributions. A contributor must attest, using a form designed by the Commission on 7 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, that a qualifying contribution wa s made 8 
using the contributor's personal funds and the contributor received nothing in return for 9 
the contribution.  Finally, the bill provides that a candidate may submit a check to the 10 
Maine Clean Election Fund equal to the amount of qualifying contributi ons made in cash 11 
along with the receipt and acknowledgment forms required to be submitted to be certified 12 
as a participating candidate under the Maine Clean Election Act.  13
