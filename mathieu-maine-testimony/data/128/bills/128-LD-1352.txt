following terms ha ve the following meanings.  10 
A.  "Grid -scale solar electricity generating facility" or "grid -scale project" means a 11

megawatts and 10 megawatts.  13 
B.  "Qualifying brownfields site" means a municipally owned inactive capped 14 
landfill, a municipally owned active landfill with capped sections that can 15

A.  One grid -scale project, 10 megawatts in size, located on a qualifying brownfields 25 
site; 26 
B.  Three grid -scale projects, 5 megawatts in size; and  27 
C.  Five grid -scale projects, 2 megawatts in size.  28 
If the commission does not receive eli gible proposals to procure all 35 megawatts of 29 
installed generating capacity from grid -scale solar electricity generating facilities, the 30 
commission may issue additional requests for proposals every 6 months until all 35 31 
megawatts are procured.  32 
The commiss ion shall give preference to a 2 -megawatt or 5 -megawatt grid -scale project 33 
that is proposed to be located on a qualifying brownfields site.  The commission shall 34 
give preference to those proposals that are most likely to begin commercial operation the 35 
soon est. 36 
Prior to the issuance of a request for proposals, the commission shall develop, in 37 
consultation with an investor -owned transmission and distribution utility, a standard 38 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR1424(01) -1 
 contract that commits all parties to commercially reasonable behavior and includes  1 
provisions to ensure that grid -scale projects proceed to commercial operation within 24 2 
months of receiving a contract.  3 
3.  Eligibility.   In order to be eligible for a contract under this section, an applicant 4 
for a grid -scale project must submit to the c ommission in response to a request for 5

E.  Evidence that at least 51% of the facility is owned by a qualifying local owner.  17 
4.  Long -term contracts.   After reviewing proposals, the commission may direct an 18 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility to enter into a long -term contract for 19 
the energy and capacity of a n eligible grid -scale project located within the service 20 
territory of the utility.  The contract must include the following provisions:  21 
A.  A term of 20 years, commencing from when the grid -scale project first delivers 22 
energy to the transmission and distri bution utility's system;  23 
B.  A price per kilowatt -hour to be paid for both the energy and capacity of the 24 
grid-scale project of $0.067 regardless of project size or location; and  25 
C.  A provision requiring ownership and monetary benefits from any renewable 26 
energy credit generated by the grid -scale project to be retained by the owner of the 27 
grid-scale project.  28 
Notwithstanding paragraph C, the commission may direct the utility to enter into a 29 
long-term contract for the purchase of renewable energy credits if, in its discretion, it 30 
determines there is a benefit to ratepayers based on the terms and pricing offered to the 31 
utility from the grid -scale project.  A contract for renewable energy credits may not be for 32 
a term exceeding 15 years.  33 
An investor -owned transm ission and distribution utility shall sell energy, capacity or 34 
renewable energy credits purchased pursuant to this section into the wholesale electricity 35 
market or take any other action, as directed by the commission, related to energy, 36 
capacity or renewab le energy credits purchased pursuant to this section.  37 
A consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility may, at the option of the utility, 38 
and with commission approval, enter into long -term contracts for eligible grid -scale 39 
projects located within the  service territory of the utility for energy, capacity or renewable 40 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR1424(01) -1 
 energy credits, as long as the necessary infrastructure exists to transmit the electricity 1 
generated into an investor -owned transmission and distribution utility's service territory.  2 
Contr act payments for energy may be made only after the contracted amounts of energy 3 
have been provided.  4 
5.  Cost recovery.   The commission shall ensure that all costs and direct financial 5 
benefits associated with contracts entered into under this section are a llocated to 6 
ratepayers in accordance with section 3210 -F.  A price differential existing at any time 7 
during the term of the contract between the contract price and the prevailing market price 8 
at which the energy, capacity or renewable energy credit is sold  must be reflected in the 9 
amounts charged to ratepayers and may not be considered imprudent.  10 
For the purposes of this subsection, "ratepayer" does not include those customers 11 
receiving service at a transmission or subtransmission voltage level as defined i n section 12 
10110, subsection 6.  13 
6.  Rules.   The commission shall adopt rules to provide protections for ratepayers 14 
over the term of the contracts entered into pursuant to this section.  Rules adopted under 15

2-A. 17

35-A, section 3475.  20 
SUMMARY  21 
This bil l requires the Public Utilities Commission to issue a request for proposals to 22 
procure 35 megawatts of grid -scale solar electricity.  This bill requires that one project be 23 
10 megawatts in size and be located on a qualifying brownfields site, 3 projects be  5 24 
megawatts in size and 5 projects be 2 megawatts in size.  In addition to meeting other 25 
requirements, an applicant for a grid -scale project must show that at least 51% of the 26 
facility is owned locally in order to be eligible for a contract.  The commissi on may direct 27 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utilities to enter into contracts with a term 28 
of 20 years for the energy and capacity of a project at a rate of $0.067 per kilowatt -hour.  29 
The bill directs the commission to adopt rules to implemen t the procurement process and 30 
to ensure protections for ratepayers.  31
