SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. It removes the provisions in 
the bill requiring an additional statement on a petition for a direct initiative of legislation 
indicating if the circulator is being paid to solicit signatures. The amendment clarifies the 
definition of "major contributor." It provides that a person, other than an individual, 
becomes a major contributor upon making one or more contributions aggregating 
$100,000 or more to a ballot question committee or political action committee to 
influence any one direct initiative campaign or any one people's veto referendum 
campaign. The amendment also changes the date by which a major contributor must file 
a report. Under the bill, the report is due at the same time as the recipient committee's 
October quarterly report. The amendment provides that the major contributor files a 
report on or before the next regularly scheduled filing deadline after the major contributor 
receives notice of the reporting requirement. Under the bill, a major contributor is 
required to report the 5 largest sources of funds received by the major contributor during 
the 12 months prior to submitting the report. The amendment provides that the report 
must identify the 5 largest sources of funds received by the major contributor during the 
period 6 months before the first contribution is made to the direct initiative or people's 
veto campaign through the date the report is filed. Finally, the amendment provides that 
a major contributor is not required to identify a source of funds if that source restricted 
the use of those funds to purposes that are unrelated to a direct initiative or people's veto 
campaign. The bill allows for this exception to be governed by rules to be adopted by the 
Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices.

Additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State associated with implementing this legislation can be absorbed
