Page 1 - 128LR2509(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  36 MRSA  §1482, sub-§1, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 263, §1, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 C.  For the privilege of operating a motor  vehicle or camper trailer on the public 
5 ways, each motor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or each camper trailer to be so 
6 operated is subject  to excise tax as follows, except as specified in subparagraph (3), 
7 (4) or (5):  a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the maker's list purchase price  
8 for the first or current  year of model,  17 1/2 mills  on each dollar of the maker's list 
9 price for the 2nd year, 13 1/2 mills on each dollar  of the maker's list price for the 3rd 
10 year, 10 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills on 
11 each dollar of the maker's list price  for the 5th year and 4 mills on each dollar of the 
12 maker's list price for the 6th and succeeding  years.   The minimum tax is $5 for a 
13 motor vehicle other than a bicycle with motor  attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with 
14 motor attached,  $15 for a camper  trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent 
15 trailer.  The excise tax on a stock race car is $5.  Notwithstanding section 1481, 
16 subsection 7, for the purposes of this paragraph, "purchase price" means the amount 
17 of money financed  or paid by the consumer after application of any trade-ins, rebates 
18 or discounts or offers or promises that the consumer receive back all or a portion  of 
19 the price paid.  Verification of purchase price  for the application of excise  tax is 
20 determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided  at point 
21 of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial purchaser 
22 of a new  vehicle.
23 (1)  On new registrations of automobiles, trucks  and truck tractors, the excise tax 
24 payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one-year  period from the 
25 date of registration.
26 (2)  Vehicles registered  under the International Registration Plan are subject to an 
27 excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if their registration  period is 
28 less than 12 months.
29 (3)  For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the 
30 amount of excise tax due for trucks  or truck  tractors registered for more than 
31 26,000 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title  
32 29-A, section  101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original  
33 year of title rather than on the list price.   Verification of purchase price for the 
34 application of excise tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales 
35 tax document provided at point of purchase.   The initial bill of sale is that issued 
36 by the dealer to the  initial purchaser of  a new vehicle.
37 (4)  For buses manufactured  in model year 2006 and after,  the amount of excise 
38 tax due is based on the purchase price  in the original year of title rather than on 
39 the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is 
40 determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales  tax document provided at 
41 point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
42 purchaser of a new vehicle.
Page 2 - 128LR2509(01)-11 (5)  For trucks or truck tractors  registered  for more than 26,000 pounds that have 
2 been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle 
3 or body but does not include a power train or engine and for which  a new 
4 certificate of title is required to be issued, the amount  of excise tax due is based 
5 on the maker's list  price  of the prepackaged  kit.
6 For motor vehicles being  registered pursuant to Title 29-A,  section 405, subsection 1, 
7 paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number  of months in the 
8 registration.
9 SUMMARY
10 This bill changes the method of computing the excise tax that is levied on motor 
11 vehicles and camper trailers registered in the State.
12 With the exception of certain commercial motor vehicles and buses and special 
13 mobile equipment, current  law requires that the excise tax be based  upon the maker's  list 
14 price for the motor vehicle.   This bill requires that the excise tax on motor vehicles  and 
15 camper trailers  be based on the purchase price of the vehicle  for the first year and on the 
16 maker's list price for all succeeding years.   Either the original  bill of sale or the state sales 
17 tax document may be  used  to verify the purchase  price.
