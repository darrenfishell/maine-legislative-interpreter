The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will require General Fund appropriations of $258,653 in 
fiscal year 2017-18 and $141,480 in fiscal year 2018-19 for one-time technology changes to multiple eligibility 
systems and on-going funding for electronic income verification. DHHS will also require Federal Expenditures Fund, 
Other Special Revenue Funds and Federal Block Grant Fund allocations for the federal portion of the above changes. 
Additionally, the change in eligibility requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will reduce 
Other Special Revenue Funds revenue by $49,000 beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 due to a loss of a child support 
transaction fee. 
Additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State associated with providing photographs can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. Highway Fund revenue is expected to increase by minor amounts not requiring 
any change to the budget. The Department of the Attorney General will incur additional costs related to the reporting 
requirements. Those costs can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted resources.
