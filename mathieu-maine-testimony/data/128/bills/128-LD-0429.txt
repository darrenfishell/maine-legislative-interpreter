SUMMARY  11 
This bill clarifies that, in proceedings in which the best interest o f a child is 12

consideration.  Family members may petition for standing in a proceeding involving 14 
parental rights and responsibilities with respect to a child under certain circ umstances.  15 
This bill also requires guardians ad litem in contested cases involving the best interest of 16 
a child to issue their written report on a standard form with check boxes for each 17 
mandatory and optional duty of the guardian ad litem and to describe  the results with 18 
respect to the duties performed and to provide an explanation with respect to each duty 19 
that was not performed.  20
