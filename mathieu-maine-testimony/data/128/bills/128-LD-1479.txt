Title to the contrary, determine the just value of real and pe rsonal property located at 5 
industrial facilities as of the first day of each April beginning in 2018 and provide those 6 
just values to each municipality in which an industrial facility is located no later than 7 
June 1st of each property tax year.  In the bur eau's determination of the just value of an 8 
industrial facility, the State Tax Assessor may utilize section 706 or any other powers 9 
granted to the assessor under this Title to obtain necessary information from the taxpayer.  10 
The just value of an industrial  facility determined by the bureau is binding on local 11 
assessors, subject to equalization.  A municipality that is aggrieved by the bureau’s 12 
determination of just value of an industrial facility may petition for reconsideration 13 
pursuant to section 151.  A taxpayer that is aggrieved by the bureau’s determination of 14 
just value of an industrial facility may seek an abatement of the municipal assessment 15 
pursuant to sections 841, 843 and 844.  For purposes of this subsection, "industrial 16 
facility" means a manufa cturing facility that has or is anticipated by the bureau to have a 17 
total just value exceeding $10,000,000 in any municipality for all real and personal 18 
property located in that municipality.  19 
Sec. 6.  36 MRSA §706, as amended by PL 2013, c. 544, §5 and aff ected by §7, is 20 
further amended to read:  21 
§706.  Taxpayers to list property; notice; verification  22 
Before making an assessment, the assessor or assessors, the chief assessor of a 23 
primary assessing area or the State Tax Assessor in the case of the unorganized  territory 24 
may give seasonable notice in writing to all persons liable to taxation or qualifying for 25 
exemption pursuant to subchapter 4 -C in the municipality, primary assessing area or the 26 
unorganized territory to furnish to the assessor or assessors, chie f assessor or State Tax 27 
Assessor true and perfect lists of all their estates of which they were possessed on the first 28 
day of April of the same year.  29 
The notice to owners may be by mail directed to the last known address of the 30 
taxpayer or by any other met hod that provides reasonable notice to the taxpayer.  31 
If notice is given by mail and the taxpayer does not furnish the list, the taxpayer is 32 
barred of the right to make application to the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State 33 
Tax Assessor or any ap peal from an application for any abatement of those taxes, unless 34 
the taxpayer furnishes the list with the application and satisfies the assessing authority or 35 
authority to whom an appeal is made that the taxpayer was unable to furnish the list at the 36 
time appointed.  37 
The assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor may require the 38 
person furnishing the list to make oath to its truth, which oath any of them may 39 
administer.  40 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR1634(01) -1 
 The assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor may req uire the 1 
taxpayer to answer in writing all proper inquiries  a total of no more than 30 2 
interrogatories or document requests or a combination of interrogatories and document 3 
requests not exceeding 30 in the aggregate seeking information  as to the nature, si tuation 4 
and value of the taxpayer's property liable to be taxed in the State or subject to exemption 5 
pursuant to subchapter 4 -C.  Each distinct subpart in an interrogatory or document request 6 
is considered a separate interrogatory for the purpose of the 30 -request limit.  A taxpayer 7 
may make reasonable objections to responding to interrogatories or document requests to 8 
the same extent as objections may be made under the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.   9 
As may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the value o f property according to the 10 
income approach to value pursuant to the requirements of section 208 -A or generally 11 
accepted assessing practices, these inquiries  interrogatories and document requests  may 12 
seek information about income and expenses, manufacturin g or operational efficiencies, 13 
manufactured or generated sales price trends or other related information. A taxpayer has 14 
30 days from receipt of such an inquiry  interrogatories and document requests  to respond. 15 
Upon written request, a taxpayer is entitled to a 30 -day extension to respond to the 16 
inquiry  interrogatories and document requests  and the assessor may at any time grant 17 
additional extensions upon written request. Information provided by the taxpayer in 18 
response to an inquiry  interrogatory or documen t request  that is proprietary information, 19 
and clearly labeled by the taxpayer as proprietary and confidential information, is 20 
confidential and is exempt from the provisions of Title 1, chapter 13. An assessor of the 21 
taxing jurisdiction may not , without th e taxpayer's written consent,  allow the inspection 22 
of or otherwise release such proprietary information to anyone other than the State Tax 23 
Assessor, who shall treat such proprietary information as subject to section 191, 24 
subsection 1, except that the exemp tion provided in section 191, subsection 2, paragraph I 25 
does not apply to such proprietary information.  As used in this subsection, "proprietary 26 
information" means information that is a trade secret or production, commercial or 27 
financial information the d isclosure of which would impair the competitive position of 28 
the person submitting the information and would make available information not 29 
otherwise publicly available and information protected from disclosure by federal or state 30 
law or regulations.  A per son who knowingly violates the confidentiality provisions of 31 
this paragraph commits a Class E crime.  32 
A taxpayer's refusal or neglect to answer inquiries bars an appeal, but the answers are 33 
not conclusive upon the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or St ate Tax Assessor.  34 
If the assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor fail to give notice by 35 
mail, the taxpayer is not barred of the right to make application for abatement; however, 36 
upon demand the taxpayer shall answer in writing all prope r inquiries as to the nature, 37 
situation and value of the taxpayer's property liable to be taxed in the State.  A taxpayer's 38 
refusal or neglect to answer the inquiries and subscribe the same bars an appeal, but the 39 
list and answers are not conclusive upon t he assessor or assessors, chief assessor or the 40 
State Tax Assessor.  41 
Sec. 7.  36 MRSA §708, as amended by PL 1973, c. 620, §17, is further amended 42 
to read:  43
