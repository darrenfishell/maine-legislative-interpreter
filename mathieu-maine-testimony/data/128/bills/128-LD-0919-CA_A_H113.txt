This legislation establishes the Summer Success Program within the Department of Education to facilitate the 
development of high-quality summer success programs in school administrative units (SAU's) statewide. It requires 
the department to establish standards and approval criteria for those SAU's that choose to apply to the program and to 
begin providing grants to qualified SAU's beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. 
Requiring the department to provide grants to eligible SAU' s beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 will result in increased 
General Fund costs to the department if funding is not received from other sources or if the funding received is not 
sufficient to meet both the total cost of the grants and the administrative costs to the department. This legislation 
requires the department, by December 15, 2017 and prior to December 15th of eve1y subsequent year, to submit a 
budget request for the amount of General Fund appropriations and Other Special Revenue Funds and Federal 
Expenditures Fund allocations required to provide 90% of the cost of the program in the next fiscal year. However, if 
the budget request is not submitted by the Governor or approved by the Legislature, other existing programs and 
services within the department may be negatively impacted. 
This bill creates the Summer Success Program Fund as a dedicated, non-lapsing fund to accept funding from social 
impact bonds, federal, state, and local grants as well as private funding sources to support the program. This bill 
includes base Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $500 per year beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 to a newly 
established Summer Success Program Fund account within the Department of Education in order to expend monies in 
the event that funding is received.
