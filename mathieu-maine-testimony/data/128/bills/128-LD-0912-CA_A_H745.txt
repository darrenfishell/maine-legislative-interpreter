bisexual or transgender is a mental illness or disorder caused by a developmental 
deficiency or trauma or by unmet emotional needs, which can be cured by conversion 
therapy addressing those underlying issues. However, the nation's leading health and 
mental health authorities recognize being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender and 
having same-sex attractions as normal variants of human sexuality and gender; 
B. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting claims that 
conversion therapy can change an individual's sexual orientation; rather, there is 
substantial competent and reliable scientific evidence that conversion therapy is 
ineffective and can and often does result in significant health and safety risks to 
consumers of those services, including a risk of death by suicide, as well as economic 
losses; 
C. Mainstream medical and mental health professional organizations, including the 
American School Counselor Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the 
American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the 
American Counseling Association Governing Council, the American Medical 
Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family 
Physicians, the National Association of Social Workers and the Pan American Health 
Organization have concluded that conversion therapy is both ineffective in changing 
sexual orientation or gender identity and poses safety and health risks; 
D. The United Nations Committee against Torture and Human Rights Council have 
likewise supported an end to conversion therapy; and 
E. The State has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological 
well-being of minors, including the State's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
youth, from the marketing, selling and administration of conversion therapy and in 
protecting its minors from the serious health and safety harms that conversion therapy 
can cause, including the risk of death by suicide, and economic loss. 
2. Legislative intent. It is the intent of the Legislature to protect the public health 
and safety of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans gender youth of the State by prohibiting 
the marketing, selling and administration of therapy designed to change a person's sexual 
orientation or gender identity, also known as conversion therapy, to individuals under 18 
years of age in the State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee and replaces the bill, which 
is a concept draft. This amendment does the following. 
1. It defines "conversion therapy" as any practice or treatment that seeks to change an 
individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, except for counseling or treatment 
intended to assist an individual undergoing a gender transition; counseling intended to 
provide acceptance, support and understanding to the individual; and counseling intended 
to facilitate the individual's coping, social support or identity exploration and 
development, including any therapeutic intervention that is neutral with regard to sexual 
orientation, and that seeks to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual 
practices, as long as the counseling does not seek to change the individual's sexual 
orientation or gender identity.

2. It provides that advertising, offering or administering conversion therapy to 
individuals under 18 years of age in the State is an unfair trade practice. Court actions 
involving conversion therapy brought against health care providers under the Maine 
Unfair Trade Practices Act are not governed by the specialized procedures set forth in the 
Maine Health Security Act for actions involving professional negligence. 
3. It prohibits certified school psychologists and guidance counselors, nurses, 
doctors, physician assistants, psychologists, psychological examiners, alcohol and drug 
counselors and aides, social workers, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, professional 
counselors, marriage and family therapists, pastoral counselors, speech-language 
pathologists and assistants, and audiologists from administering conversion therapy to 
individuals under 18 years of age. Administration of conversion therapy to an individual 
under 18 years of age in violation of this prohibition is grounds for discipline of the 
professional by the department or board that issued the professional's license or 
certification, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of the license or 
certification. 
4. It prohibits MaineCare reimbursement for conversion therapy administered to an 
individual who is under 18 years of age. 
5. It adds a statement oflegislative findings and intent.
