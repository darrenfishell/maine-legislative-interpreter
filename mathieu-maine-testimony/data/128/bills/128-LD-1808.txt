Page 1 - 128LR2854(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §349, sub-§2-A, as enacted  by PL 1997, c. 570, §1, is amended 
3 to read:
4 2-A.  Supplemental environmental  projects.   In settling a civil enforcement  action 
5 for any violation of any of the provisions of the laws administered by the department, 
6 including, without limitation, a violation of the terms or conditions of any order, rule, 
7 license, permit,  approval or decision of the board or commissioner, the parties may agree 
8 to a supplemental environmental project that mitigates not more  than 80% up to 100%  of 
9 the assessed penalty.  "Supplemental environmental project" means an environmentally  
10 beneficial project  primarily benefiting public health or the environment  that a violator  is 
11 not otherwise required or  likely  to perform.
12 A.  An eligible  supplemental environmental project is limited to the following 
13 categories:
14 (1)  Pollution prevention projects  that eliminate all or a significant  portion of 
15 pollutants at the point of generation;
16 (2)  Pollution reduction projects that significantly decrease the release  of 
17 pollutants into a waste stream at the point of discharge to a point significantly 
18 beyond levels required for compliance;
19 (3)  Environmental enhancement  projects in the same  ecosystem  or geographic 
20 area of the violation that significantly improve an area beyond  what is required to 
21 remediate any damage  caused by the violation that is the subject  of the 
22 enforcement action;
23 (4)  Environmental awareness projects substantially related  to the violation that 
24 provide training, publications or technical support to members of the public  
25 regulated by the department;
26 (5)  Scientific research and data collection  projects that advance the scientific 
27 basis on which regulatory  decisions are  made;
28 (6)  Emergency planning  and preparedness  projects that assist state or local  
29 emergency response and planning entities  in preparing or responding to 
30 emergencies; and
31 (7)  Public  health  projects  that provide a direct and measurable benefit to public  
32 health.
33 B.  Supplemental environmental projects may not be used for the following 
34 situations:
35 (1)  Repeat violations of the same or a substantially similar law administered by 
36 the department by the  same person;
37 (2) When a project is required by law;
38 (3)  If the violator had  previously planned  and budgeted for the project;
39 (4)  To offset  any calculable economic benefit  of noncompliance;
Page 2 - 128LR2854(01)-11 (5)  If the violation is the result of reckless or intentional conduct; or
2 (6)  If the project  primarily  benefits the violator.
3 Any settlement that includes  a supplemental  environmental project must provide that 
4 expenditures are not tax deductible and are ineligible for certification as tax exempt  
5 pollution control  facilities  pursuant to Title 36, chapters 105 and  211.
6 Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §589, sub-§3,  as amended by PL 1993, c. 464, §1, is further 
7 amended to read:
8 3.  Emission monitoring  devices.  Except as provided in this subsection, failure by a 
9 person to register, install, maintain and use emission monitoring devices or to file reports  
10 from those devices renders that person liable to the penalties  prescribed in section  349.  
11 Emission monitoring  devices  must record accurate and reliable  data during all source-
12 operating time except for periods when  emission monitoring devices are subject to 
13 established quality assurance and quality  control procedures or to unavoidable 
14 malfunction.  In any enforcement action brought  by the department, the burden  of proof is 
15 on the licensee to demonstrate  that the failure of emission  monitoring devices  to record 
16 accurate and reliable data was due to an unavoidable malfunction or the performance  of 
17 established quality assurance  and quality  control  procedures  on the monitoring system.
18 A.  The department may not initiate enforcement action  pursuant to section 349 
19 against any person for failure to operate a continuous emission monitoring system for 
20 gaseous emissions as long as the system is recording accurate and reliable data at 
21 least 90% 95% of the source-operating time in each quarter of the calendar  year and 
22 the person can demonstrate  to the satisfaction  of the department that the failure  of the 
23 system to record accurate and reliable data during any period of time was due to the 
24 performance of established  quality assurance and quality control procedures or 
25 unavoidable malfunctions.  If the continuous emission monitoring system for gaseous  
26 emissions is recording  accurate and reliable  data less than 90% 95% of source-
27 operating time within any quarter of the calendar year, the department may initiate 
28 enforcement action and may include in that enforcement  action  any period of time 
29 that the continuous emission monitoring  system was not recording accurate and 
30 reliable data during that quarter unless the licensee  can demonstrate to the satisfaction 
31 of the department that the failure of the system to record accurate and reliable data 
32 was due to the performance of established quality assurance and quality control  
33 procedures or unavoidable  malfunctions.
34 B.  The department may not initiate enforcement action  pursuant  to section  349 
35 against any person for failure  to operate a continuous opacity monitoring system as 
36 long as the system  is recording accurate and reliable data at least 95% of the source-
37 operating time in each quarter of the calendar year, excluding time periods  when the 
38 licensee is performing  quality assurance and quality control procedures on the system 
39 that are required by the department, and the person  can demonstrate to the 
40 satisfaction of the department that the failure  of the system to record accurate and 
41 reliable data during any period of time was due to the performance of established  
42 quality assurance  and quality control  procedures  or unavoidable malfunctions .  If the 
43 continuous opacity monitoring system is recording accurate and reliable data less 
44 than 95% of the source-operating time within any quarter of the calendar  year, the 
Page 3 - 128LR2854(01)-11 department may initiate enforcement action and may include in that enforcement 
2 action any period of time that the continuous  opacity monitoring system was not 
3 recording accurate and reliable data during that quarter unless the licensee can 
4 demonstrate to the satisfaction  of the department that the failure of the system to 
5 record accurate and reliable data was due to the performance  of established quality 
6 assurance and quality  control procedures or unavoidable malfunctions.
7 Sec. 3.  38 MRSA  §2124-A, first ¶, as amended  by PL 2011, c. 655, Pt. GG, §31 
8 and affected by §70, is further  amended  to read:
9 By January  1, 2013 2020 and annually biennially thereafter,  the department shall  
10 submit a report  to the joint standing committee of the Legislature  having  jurisdiction over 
11 environmental and natural resources matters and the Governor setting forth  information 
12 on statewide generation of solid  waste, statewide  recycling rates  and available disposal 
13 capacity for solid waste.
14 SUMMARY
15 This bill, which is reported  out by the Joint  Standing Committee on Environment  and 
16 Natural Resources pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 3, section 955, 
17 subsection 4, implements the recommendations resulting  from the committee's State 
18 Government Evaluation  Act review  of the Department of Environmental  Protection as 
19 follows:
20 1.  It removes a statutory provision prohibiting a repeat violator  of the same  
21 environmental law from  taking advantage of a supplemental environmental project  to 
22 mitigate an assessed civil penalty;
23 2.  It allows  a violator of an environmental law to offset up to 100% of an assessed  
24 civil penalty by conducting a supplemental environmental project.  Under  current law, 
25 such a violator may offset no more  than 80% of an assessed civil penalty  by conducting a 
26 supplemental environmental project;
27 3.  It clarifies 2 statutory  exemptions from the requirement that air contamination 
28 sources maintain  continuous emission monitoring systems to mitigate  a conflict  between 
29 the current  statutory provisions on continuous emission monitoring and existing 
30 applicable federal  regulations;  and
31 4.  It provides  that the solid waste generation and disposal  capacity report  the 
32 department currently must  submit  annually to the joint standing  committee of the 
33 Legislature having jurisdiction over environmental and natural resources matters  must be 
34 submitted only biennially.
