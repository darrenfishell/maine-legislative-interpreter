FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "H" to H.P. 213, L.D. 280, Bill, "An Act To 
Include Tax-exempt, Nonprofit Regional Transp01tation Providers under the Maine Tort 
Claims Act" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
emergency clause and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 23 MRSA §4209, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2015, c. 182, §2, is further 
amended to read: 
1. Geographic regions. The depattment shall divide the State into a number of 
geographic regions for regional distribution of state-administered transportation funds. 
Upon designation of the geographic regions, a regional public transportation agency must 
be selected from each region to formulate a quinquennial locally coordinated plan for 
regional transit in accordance with federal requirements. The department shall select 
regional public transp01tation agencies in collaboration with transit stakeholders, 
including transportation providers, social service organizations, the United States 
Depattment of Transp01iation, Federal Transit Administration and the Public Transit 
Advisory Council under section 4209-A. The department shall establish a schedule for 
submittal of the quinquennial locally coordinated plans for regional transit to the 
department for review and approval in accordance with subsection 2. 
A tax-exempt, nonprofit regional public transportation agency selected by the depaitment 
under this subsection is deemed to be a "transit district" as defined in Title 30-A, section 
3501, subsection 1 for the purposes of the Maine Tort Claims Act.'

"transit districts," defined in Title 30-A, section 3501, subsection 1, within the definition 
of "political subdivision" and thus covered by the immunity and limited liability of the 
Act. This amendment amends the public transpottation statutes to expressly treat the tax-
