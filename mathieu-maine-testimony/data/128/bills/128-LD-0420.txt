SUMMARY  23 
This bill changes the determination for property fiscal capacity as used to determine 24 
the amount of state aid a school administrative unit receives under the school funding 25 
formula if a municipality  has experienced a decline in state valuation of at least 35% 26 
attributable to one taxpayer.  Under this bill, the State Tax Assessor is required to certify 27 
to the Commissioner of Education when a municipality's state valuation has declined by 28 
at least 35% from the previous year's certified state valuation and the decline is due to the 29 
loss in value attributable to a single taxpayer.  When those conditions have been met, the 30 
property fiscal capacity for that municipality is the most recently certified state valuation.  31
