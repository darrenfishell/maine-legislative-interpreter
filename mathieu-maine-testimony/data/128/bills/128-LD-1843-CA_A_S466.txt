28 SUMMARY 
29 This amendment, which is the unanimous report of the committee, removes the 
30 section in the bill delaying implementation of the exclusion of career and technical 
31 education costs in the base year for purposes of the school funding formula. The 
32 amendment establishes that any affiliated school administrative unit that wishes to 
33 operate a career and technical education region satellite program must follow the same 
34 authorization procedure as career and technical education centers and amends the 
35 definition of "satellite program" to include programs affiliated with career and technical 
36 education regions. The amendment requires personnel working for a satellite program to 
3 7 be supervised by the career and technical education director in consultation with the 
38 school administrative unit superintendent or high school principal. The amendment 
39 specifies that the middle school pilot projects established in the bill are for career and 
40 technical education exploration. As in the bill, the amendment allows the Commissioner 
41 of Education to contract for services for middle school career and technical education 
42 exploration programs but requires the commissioner to collaborate with career and 
43 technical education directors. The amendment directs the Commissioner.of Education to

Fiscal Note 
Establishes pilot projects for CTE middle school programs 
Change in CTE funding model 
This bill establishes pilot projects for middle school career and technical education exploration (CTE) beginning in 
fiscal year 2018-19 and extending through fiscal year 2020-21. The amount of funding that will be available to be 
distributed to CTE centers and CTE regions with approved plans will depend on the amount allocated for this purpose 
in LD 1869, An Act To Establish the Total Cost of Education and the State and Local Contributions to Education for 
Fiscal Year 2018-19 and To Provide That Employees of School lvlanagement and Leadership Centers Are Eligible To 
Participate in the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. 
This bill also changes the calculation of state subsidy for career and teclmical education from an expenditure driven 
model to a model that recognizes cun-ent costs for certain areas such as direct instruction, operation of facilities and 
administrative support beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. Although the initial requirement to change the funding model 
for career and technical education was enacted in Public Law 2013, chapter 368, Part C.,12 and was to begin in fiscal 
year 2014-15, legislation approved in subsequent legislative sessions delayed the implementation of this requirement 
until fiscal year 2018-19. This change in the calculation of state subsidy for CTE will increase the total cost of CTE 
education by approximately $1.2 million in fiscal year 2018-19. The cost of funding CTE education based on this new 
model is also included in LD 1869. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to prepare the required repo1i can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
