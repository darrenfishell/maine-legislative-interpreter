2.  Custody and control generally.   The custody and control of the remains of 4 
deceased residents of this State, dead bodies or dead human bodies are governed by the 5 
following provisions in the following order of priority:  6 
A.  If the subject has designated another person to have custody and control in a 7 
written and signed document, custody and control belong to that designated person;  8 
B.  If the subject has not left a written and signed document designating a person to 9 
have custody and control, or if the person designated by the subject refuses custody 10 
and control, custody and control belong to the next  of kin; and  11 
C.  If the next of kin is 2 or more persons with the same relationship to the subject, 12 
the majority of the next of kin have custody and control.  If the next of kin can not, by 13 
majority vote, make a decision regarding the subject's remains, th e court shall make 14 
the decision upon petition under subsection 4, paragraph D.  15 
If a person who has the right of custody and control under this subsection does not 16 
exercise the rights and responsibilities of custody and control within 4 days after the 17 
death  of the subject, custody and control belong to a person from the next lower level of 18 
priority as established in paragraphs A to C.  19 
A person who has been charged with murder, as described in Title 17 -A, section 201, or 20

the right of custody and control provided under this subsection; and a funeral director or 22 
practitioner of funeral service who is aware of the charges may not release the remains or 23 
a dead body to that p erson who has been charged with murder or manslaughter. If the 24 
charges against the person are dismissed or the person is acquitted of the charges before 25 
the final disposition takes place, the person regains the right of custody and control in the 26 
same posi tion of priority established in this subsection.  27 
The remains or a dead body is considered abandoned if no one takes custody and control 28 
of the remains or dead body for a period of 15 days or if the person who has custody and 29 
control does not make a decisio n regarding disposition within 30 days .  A funeral director 30 
or practitioner of funeral service who has physical possession of abandoned remains or an 31 
abandoned dead body may bury the remains or dead body.  The funeral director or 32

abandoned dead body without authorization.  A certificate of abandonment that indicates 34 
the means of disposition must be filed in the municipality where the death occurred.  35
