JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING VIETNAM VETERANS
 APPRECIATION DAY ON MARCH 30, 2017
             WHEREAS, the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South Vietnam from 1961 to 1975 and the United States Armed Forces became involved in Vietnam to
 provide direct military support for the Republic of South Vietnam to defend itself
 against the growing communist threat from North Vietnam; and
 
            WHEREAS, according to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, 8,744,000 military personnel served on active duty during the Vietnam War and
 2,594,000 personnel served within the borders of South Vietnam between January 1,
 1965 and March 28, 1973; and
 
            WHEREAS, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support units from South Vietnam; and
 
            WHEREAS, the State of Maine has 343 names etched on the black granite wall
 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in the Nation's capital, and 12 of our soldiers are still
 missing in Southeast Asia; and
 
            WHEREAS, March 30th of each year is Vietnam War Remembrance Day in Maine, to honor the service and sacrifice of those veterans of the United States Armed
 Forces who served during the Vietnam War; and
 
            WHEREAS, as with veterans returning from today's battlefields, those who
 served in Vietnam came home with both physical and unseen injuries of war, and many
 of those unseen injuries went undiagnosed and were not as well initially understood by
 the medical community and citizenry as they are now; and
             WHEREAS, we must continue to honor the millions of men and women who
 served with valor during the Vietnam War, including those who suffered unseen
 injuries; and
 
            WHEREAS, Vietnam Veterans Appreciation Day specifically honors the
 7,200,000 living Vietnam War veterans and the 9,000,000 families of those veterans;
 now, therefore, be it 
            RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth
 Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf
 of the people we represent, take this opportunity to join in the observance of Vietnam
 Veterans Appreciation Day in order to honor the contributions of living veterans who served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam; and be it further
 
            RESOLVED: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly authenticated by the
 Secretary of State, be transmitted to the Department of Defense, Veterans and
 Emergency Management. 
 
            READ and ADOPTED.
 
            Sent for concurrence.
