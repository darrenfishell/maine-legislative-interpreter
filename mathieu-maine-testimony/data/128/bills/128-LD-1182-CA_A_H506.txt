Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry (ACF) to solicit infonnation from 
manufacturers and distributors of food products regarding the presence of certain chemicals in their food or food 
packaging and to make a database of this information available to the public. The bill allows ACF to assess a fee on 
manufacturers and distributors to cover the cost of the program. This fiscal note assumes that roughly 500 
manufacturers and distributors of food or food products will meet the reporting criteria and will pay a $100 annual fee 
that will generate annual Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $50,000 starting in fiscal year 2017-18. The bill 
includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $50, 000 annually beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 for ongoing 
maintenance of the database and website. The ACF has indicated there will be considerable start-up costs for 
construction of the database and website. As this work will need to begin well before revenue begins to be received 
from the new fee, the bill also includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $200,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 for 
contracts with vendors to create the database and website. 
While this bill only requires ACF to solicit information from manufacturers and distributors and to provide a 
compilation of this information to the public, the department has indicated it would likely seek to establish a 
laboratory testing program to ce1iify compliance. This testing program would require additional appropriations for 
purchase oflaboratory equipment, laboratory fit up and ongoing maintenance. These costs are not included in this 
fiscal note.
