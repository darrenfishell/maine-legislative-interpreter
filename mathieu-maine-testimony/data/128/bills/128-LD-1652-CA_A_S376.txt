128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " ~" to S.P. 609, L.D. 1652, Bill, "An Act To 
Authorize the Commissioner of Marine Resources To Limit the Number of Shrimp 
Licenses That May Be Used in Certain Seasons" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 2. 12 MR.SA §6804, sub-§2-A is enacted to read: 
2-A. Licenses limited. The commissioner may establish by rule a system to limit 
the number of commercial northern shrimp licenses issued under this section when the 
total allowable catch for northern shrimp established for Maine by the Atlantic States 
Marine Fisheries Commission is less than 2,000 metric tons. Rules adopted pursuant to 
this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 
2-A. 
Prior to initiating rulemaking, the commissioner shall consult with members of the 
northern shrimp industry, including individuals who are eligible to obtain a license that 
allows fishing for or taking northern shrimp and holders of a license or permit issued 
under chapter 625 that allows wholesale or retail activity involving northern shrimp. 
The commissioner shall provide a report regarding management of the northern shrimp 
resource and the northern shrimp fishing industry to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over marine resources matters by January 15th of the year 
following a year in which the commissioner limited the number of licenses issued under 
this section. The joint standing committee may report out legislation to the session of the 
Legislature in which the report was received regarding management of the northern 
shrimp resource or the northern shrimp fishing industry.'

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would authorize the Department of Marine Resources to adopt rnles to limit the number of licenses issued to 
establish a limited commercial n01ihem shrimp fishery when the total allowable catch as authorized by the Atlantic 
States Marine Fisheries Commission is less than 2,000 metric tons. Because the number of licenses issued would be 
contingent upon the total allowable catch authorized, no estimate is made at this time of the number of licenses that 
will be issued. However, since no commercial northern shrimp licenses have been issued since fiscal year 2013-14, 
any licenses issued would increase revenue to the General Fund and the Shrimp Management Fund. Any additional 
costs to the department to adopt rnles limiting the number of commercial northern slu.imp licenses or to report on the 
commercial northern slu.·imp industry are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
