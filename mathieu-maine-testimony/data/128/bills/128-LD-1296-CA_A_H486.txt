HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 893, L.D. 1296, Bill, "An Act To 
Prohibit the Privatization of State Correctional Facilities and the State's Forensic 
Hospitals" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Ensure Legislative Participation in Planning and Approval of Certain 
Changes in Correctional Services and To Prohibit the Privatization of Corrections 
Ownership and Services and Certain Ownership and Services in the Provision of 
Forensic Mental Health Services in Mental Health Institutes' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 34-A MRSA §1201, as amended by PL 1991, c. 314, §9, is further 
amended to read: 
§1201. Legislative intent; findings 
Recognizing the need to firmly control all of the State's correctional and detention 
facilities, provide for the safety of staff and clients, undertake appropriate programming 
for the classification, education, rehabilitation and maintenance of clients and assure an 
effective system for the supervision of parolees and probationers, it is the intent of the 
Legislature to create a Department of Corrections to improve the administration of 
correctional facilities, programs and services for clients. 
The Legislature finds and declares that the management, administration and operation 
of the State's correctional and detention facilities involve functions that are inherently 
governmental. The imprisonment of persons convicted of or detained for crimes requires 
discretionazy decisions and the exercise of the State's coercive police powers that 
profoundly affect those persons and their families, distinguishing imprisonment and the 
privatization of imprisonment from privatization in other areas of government. It is 
further found that issues of liability, accountability and cost warrant a prohibition of the 
ownership, operation, administration and management by private contractors of 
correctional facilities.

private vendor for the provision of services relating to the operation of direct care and

34 of the state mental health institutes and any facilities that serve clients relocated from 
35 state mental health institutes to less intensive residential facilities for persons in the 
3 6 custody of the commissioner involve functions that are inherently governmental. The 
3 7 placement of persons committed for mental health treatment to the custody of the 
3 8 commissioner requires discretionary decisions and the exercise of the State's coercive 
39 powers that profoundly affect those persons and their families, distinguishing

41 commitment for mental health services from privatization in other areas of government.

administration and management, with an exception for services subject to a contract on 
the effective date of the Act or services· that are similar to those contracted services that

Legislature through legislation or major substantive rules. The amendment requires that 
any action by the department to decrease population, capacity or staffing of a state 
correctional facility in excess of the limit of 25% within any fiscal biennium may only be
