Page 1 - 128LR2638(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 363 and Private and Special  
4 Law 2017, chapter  5 make a partial allocation  of the state ceiling on private  activity  
5 bonds to some issuers for calendar year 2018 but leave  a portion of the state ceiling 
6 unallocated and do not provide sufficient allocations  for certain types of private activity  
7 bonds that may require  an allocation prior to the effective date of this Act if not enacted 
8 on an emergency  basis; and
9 Whereas, if these bond issues must  be delayed due to the lack of available state 
10 ceiling, the rates and terms  under which these bonds may be issued may be adversely 
11 affected, resulting  in increased  costs to beneficiaries  or even unavailability of financing  
12 for certain projects; and
13 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
14 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as
