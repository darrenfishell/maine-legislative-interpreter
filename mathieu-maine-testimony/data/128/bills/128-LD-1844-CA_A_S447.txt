receiving notice under subsection 4 that the State is not exercising the right of first 
refusal. 
4. Notice; determination. Upon receipt of information pursuant to subsection 3, the 
department may notify the Governor and the Legislative Council of the information and 
the amount of funds that would need to be made available to purchase the significant

branch to make the purchase within 10 business days of the receipt of the information, the

of taxes in an amount equal to the amount that would be paid by a private landowner to

1 first refusal does not apply if the purchaser is an immediate family member. An owner 
2 who receives an offer must notify the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
3 Forestry of the proposed sale and the terms and conditions of the sale. The department 
4 may notify the Governor and the Legislative Council. The department has 10 business

9 must manage the property in accordance with the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law and, 
10 using funds appropriated for that purpose by the Legislature, must make payments in lieu 
11 of taxes in an amount equal to the amount that would be paid by a private landowner to

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes the State's right of first refusal over property offered for sale that is over 5, 000 acres and that is 
subject to the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law program. Any land purchases under this bill will require additional 
appropriations to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF). As this bill does not require the 
ACF to act on any options to purchase land, no appropriation is required at this time and no costs are incuned. 
If the State chooses to execute a right of first refusal, the lands acquired would be classified as public nonreserved 
land managed by ACF. As public nonreserved lands, ACF is pennitted to sell the resources present on those lands or 
in certain situations assess user fees for access to the land. Under cunent law, 25% of revenue generated from public 
nonreserved land is returned to the municipality in which the land is located. This bill requires that ACF also make 
payments in lieu of taxes in an amount equal to what a private landowner would have paid to the assessing authority. 
The State does not cunently make such payments to municipalities for public nonreserved lands. These payments 
would require ongoing General Fund appropriations.
