 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง4307, sub -ยง4, as amended by PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. II, ยง1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
4.  Special circumstances.   Overseers of a municipality may not move or transport 4 
an applic ant or recipient into another municipality to relieve their municipality of 5 
responsibility for that applicant's or recipient's support.  The municipality of 6 
responsibility for relocations , persons released from correctional facilities  and 7 
institutional set tings is as follows.  8 
A.  When an applicant or recipient requests relocation to another municipality and the 9 
overseers of a municipality assist that person to relocate to another municipality, the 10 
municipality from which that person is moving continues to be responsible for the 11 
support of the recipient for 30 days after relocation.  As used in this paragraph, 12 
"assist" includes:  13 
(1)  Granting financial assistance to relocate; and  14 
(2)  Making arrangements for a person to relocate.  15 
B.  If an applicant is in a group home, shelter, rehabilitation center, nursing home, 16 
hospital or other institution at the time of application and has either been in that 17 
institution for 6 months or less, or had a residence immediately prior to entering the 18 
institution which the ap plicant had maintained and to which the applicant intends to 19 
return, the municipality of responsibility is the municipality where the applicant was 20 
a resident immediately prior to entering the institution.  For the purpose of this 21 
paragraph, a hotel, motel  or similar place of temporary lodging is considered an 22 
institution when a municipality:  23 
(1)  Grants financial assistance for a person to move to or stay in temporary 24 
lodging;  25 
(2)  Makes arrangements for a person to stay in temporary lodging;  26 
(3)  Advis es or encourages a person to stay in temporary lodging; or  27 
(4)  Illegally denies housing assistance and, as a result of that denial, the person 28 
stays in temporary lodging.  29 
C.  If an applicant has been released from a correctional facility within 45 days o f 30 
application, the municipality of responsibility for the first 12 months of payment of 31 
benefits is the municipality that was on record as the residence of the applicant when 32 
the applicant was committed to the correctional facility. A municipality of 33 
respo nsibility must accept an application for general assistance by telephone if the 34 
applicant is calling from another municipal office, as long as the written application 35 
is contemporaneously faxed or sent electronically to the municipality of 36 
responsibility.  37
