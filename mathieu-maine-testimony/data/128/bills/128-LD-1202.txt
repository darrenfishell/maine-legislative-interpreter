Notwithstanding Title 16, section 704, the criminal history record information relating to 12

not be disseminated by a criminal justice agency, whether directly or through any 14 
intermediary, except:  15 
A.  To the individual who is the subject of the criminal conviction or that individual's 16 
designee; and  17 
B.  To a criminal j ustice agency for the purpose of the administration of criminal 18 
justice and criminal justice agency employment.  For the purposes of this paragraph, 19 
dissemination to a criminal justice agency for the purpose of the administration of 20 
criminal justice includ es dissemination and use of the criminal history record 21 
information relating to the sealed criminal conviction by an attorney for the State or 22 
for another jurisdiction as part of a prosecution of the individual for a new crime, 23 
including use in a charging instrument or other public court document and in open 24 
court.  25 
2.  Prohibition on use of sealed conviction information for employment purposes.  26 
An employer that is not a criminal justice agency may not discriminate against an 27 
employee or prospective employe e based on the fact of a criminal conviction that has 28 
been sealed under this chapter.  An individual whose criminal conviction has been sealed 29 
under this chapter and who has not been convicted of another crime in this State or 30 
another jurisdiction may answ er "no" with respect to an inquiry from an employer or 31 
prospective employer that is not a criminal justice agency inquiring whether the 32 
individual has any criminal convictions.  33 
3.  Inquiries made of individual whose record is sealed.  An individual whose 34 
record of a criminal conviction has been sealed under this chapter may, in response to 35 
inquiries other than inquiries from a criminal justice agency about the crime contained in 36 
the sealed record, respond as if the crime and conviction had never occurred wi thout 37 
being subject to any sanctions.  38 
SUMMARY  39 
This bill establishes an automatic process for an individual who has been convicted of 40 
a Class C, Class D or Class E crime to have the records of that conviction sealed if the 41 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR0347(01) -1 
 crime does not involve domestic vi olence or sexual assault; the individual has not been 1 
convicted of any other crime in this State or another jurisdiction; and at least 7 years have 2 
passed since the date of conviction.  If the Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State 3 
Police, State Bure au of Identification objects to the automatic sealing of an individual's 4 
criminal conviction records, the individual may file a motion in the underlying criminal 5 
proceeding requesting that the records be sealed.  6 
The bill provides for a reduction in the 7 -year waiting period for the sealing of 7 
records of an eligible criminal conviction if a convicted individual files a motion with the 8 
court demonstrating that the individual obtained a high school diploma or postsecondary 9 
certificate or degree after the date of conviction.  10 
The bill prohibits the use of sealed criminal conviction information by all employers 11 
that are not criminal justice agencies.  The bill also authorizes individuals whose 12 
conviction records have been sealed to respond to inquiries, other than  inquiries from a 13 
criminal justice agency, as if the sealed conviction and underlying crime had never 14 
occurred.  15
