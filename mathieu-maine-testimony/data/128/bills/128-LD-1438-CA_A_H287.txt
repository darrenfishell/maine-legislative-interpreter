24 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to H.P. 993, L.D. 1438 
E. If the commissioner determines that, based upon the application and comments 
received, the lease expansion meets the requirements of subsection 7-A, the 
commissioner may approve the request for the lease expansion.' 
Amend the bill in section 6 in §6072-C by inserting after subsection 7-A the 
following: 
'7-B. Prohibition; transporting organisms. A person may not transport organisms 
grown under a limited-purpose aquaculture license that is designated for personal use to 
an area that is the subject of a limited-purpose aquaculture license that is designated for 
commercial use.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment increases the amount by which the contiguous area of a research or 
aquaculture lease may expand during the duration of the lease term from 10%, as 
provided in the bill, to 25%, except that the expansion may not be greater than 4 acres. 
The amendment clarifies that a person may submit comments to the Commissioner of 
Marine Resources regarding an application to expand a research or aquaculture lease for 
at least 30 days following the publication by the commissioner of the application 
summary. The amendment removes the provisions of the bill that require the 
commissioner to deny a lease expansion if comments are received opposing the 
expansion and instead requires the commissioner to consider all comments but to make 
the decision of whether to approve the expansion based upon the same criteria as would 
apply to a new lease application. The amendment prohibits the transport of organisms 
grown under a limited-purpose aquaculture license that is designated for personal use to 
an area that is the subject of a limited-purpose aquaculture license that is designated for 
commercial use.
