An Act To Authorize Auxiliary Licenses at Disc Golf Courses 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 'p._" 
Committee: Veterans and Legal Affairs (S-\D) 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Minor revenue increase -General Fund 
The bill allows disc golf courses to apply for auxiliary liquor licenses. As an auxiliary liquor license requires a liquor 
license to augment, the number of disc golf courses eligible for auxiliary licenses is expected to be small. The 
additional inspection and enforcement activities associated with this amendment are anticipated to be minor and can 
be absorbed within existing budgeted resources of the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lotte1y Operations. Any 
additional revenue to the General Fund from the additional auxiliaiy licenses is expected to minor.
