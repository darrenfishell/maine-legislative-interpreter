become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the Marijuana Legalization Act decriminalizes and removes civil 3 
penalties related to the p ersonal use of marijuana effective January 30, 2017; and  4 
Whereas, it is necessary that this Act take effect as soon as possible to enable 5 
members of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians who have been criminally and civilly 6 
charged for conduct that would ha ve been legal under the Marijuana Legalization Act to 7 
clear their criminal records; and  8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 10 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 11 
therefore,  12 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  13 
Sec. 1.  15 MRSA c. 313  is enacted to read:  14 
CHAPTER 313  15 
POST -JUDGMENT MOTION TO V ACATE CERTAIN MA RIJUANA 16 
CONVICTIONS OF MEMBE RS OF THE HOULTON BA ND OF MALISEET 17 
INDIANS  18 
§2401.  Legislative findings and intent  19 
The Legislature finds that Indian tribes and their members have unique status under 20 
the United States Constitution, including under Article I, Se ction 8; the Constitution of 21 
Maine, including under Article X, Section 5; and various treaties affecting Indian tribes in 22 
this State, including the Treaty of Watertown of 1776.  The Legislature further finds that 23 
Maine laws and rules reflect this unique st atus, including provisions relating to child 24 
welfare, tribal representation in the Legislature, mortgage insurance for Indian housing 25 
and hunting and fishing rights and privileges.  The Legislature further finds that these 26 
provisions of Maine law, includin g the provisions of this chapter, treat members of a 27 
federally recognized Indian tribe in this State in a manner consistent with the unique 28 
status that Indian tribes possess under the United States Constitution.  29 
The Legislature further finds that members o f the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 30 
consider marijuana to be a medicine with important uses and benefits.  Members of the 31 
Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have suffered unnecessary and unacceptable stigma 32 
from prosecutions for and convictions of possess ing marijuana for personal use, which 33 
were unfairly based on non -Indian social norms regarding the personal cultivation and 34 
personal use of marijuana.  35 
It is the intent of the Legislature to remedy these past injustices by establishing a 36 
process for members  of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to petition the court to 37 
vacate all past criminal convictions or civil violation adjudications for conduct that would 38

Legalization Act . 2
