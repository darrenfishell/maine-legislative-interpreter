Page 1 - 128LR2534(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  35-A  MRSA §10109, sub-§4,  ¶A, as amended by PL 2017, c. 282, §2, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 A.    The trust shall allocate  50% of the funds for residential programs  and 50% for 
5 commercial and industrial programs.  Trust  funds must be allocated  for measures,  
6 investments, loans, technical assistance and arrangements that reduce electricity 
7 consumption, increase energy efficiency  or reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and 
8 lower energy costs at commercial  or industrial facilities and for investment in 
9 measures that lower residential heating energy demand and reduce greenhouse gas 
10 emissions.  The measures that lower residential  heating demand  must be fuel-neutral  
11 and may include, but are not limited to, energy  efficiency improvements to residential 
12 buildings and upgrades to efficient heating systems  that will reduce residential energy  
13 costs and greenhouse  gas emissions, as determined  by the board.   The trust shall 
14 ensure that measures  to reduce the cost of residential heating are available for low-
15 income households as defined by the trust.  The trust may use funds allocated for 
16 residential programs  for group  homes for persons with intellectual disabilities in 
17 Aroostook County  as long as the trust limits the expenditure of these funds to $3,500 
18 per group  home.  When promoting electricity cost and consumption reduction,  the 
19 trust may consider  measures  at commercial and industrial facilities  that also lower  
20 peak capacity demand.  Subject to the apportionment pursuant to this subsection, the 
21 trust shall fund conservation  programs that give priority to measures  with the highest 
22 benefit-to-cost ratio, as long as cost-effective collateral  efficiency opportunities are 
23 not lost,  and that:
24 (1)  Reliably reduce  greenhouse gas production and heating  energy costs by fossil 
25 fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from  the trust fund per 
26 unit of emissions; or
27 (2)  Reliably increase the efficiency with which energy  in the State is consumed 
28 at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit of  energy saved.
29 Notwithstanding this paragraph, during  fiscal years 2017-18 to 2019-20, the trust is 
30 not required to allocate 50% of the funds to residential  programs and 50% of the 
31 funds to commercial and industrial programs and may instead allocate those funds to 
32 programs at  the trust's discretion.
33 Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §10119,  sub-§2, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 372, Pt. B, 
34 §3, is amended to read:
35 B.  Funds from the fund may be used only for programs that provide  cost-effective 
36 energy efficiency  and weatherization measures for the benefit of heating fuel 
37 customers or to efficiency service providers  serving those  customers and in 
38 accordance with the  following.
39 (1) Program categories must include low-income,  single-family and 2-family 
40 residential units, multifamily residential units, small business, commercial  and 
41 institutional and such other categories as the trust determines appropriate.  A 
42 program category must  include group homes for persons  with intellectual 
Page 2 - 128LR2534(01)-11 disabilities in Aroostook County.  Such a group home is limited to receiving 
2 $3,500 from the fund;
3 (2) Within  program categories, the trust may differentiate  between  programs for 
4 new construction and  existing  buildings;  and
5 (3) Cost-effective energy efficiency measures  must  include  measures  that 
6 improve the energy efficiency of energy-using  systems, such as heating  and 
7 cooling systems, through system upgrades  or conversions, including  conversions  
8 to energy-efficient  systems  that rely on renewable energy  sources or systems that 
9 rely on effective energy efficiency technologies.
10 SUMMARY
11 This bill provides that money in certain funds established in the Efficiency Maine  
12 Trust Act may be used to improve energy efficiency in group homes for persons with 
13 intellectual disabilities in Aroostook County.   These expenditures are limited to $3,500 
14 per group home.
