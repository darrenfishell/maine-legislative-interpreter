8 SUMMARY
9 This bill defines "female genital  mutilation" and makes it a Class A crime to perform 
10 female genital  mutilation on a female individual under  18 years  of age for nonmedical 
11 purposes.  A violation of female genital mutilation  of a minor by a person licensed by the 
12 Board of Licensure in Medicine or the Board of Osteopathic Licensure or a midwife 
13 licensed in Maine is grounds for permanent revocation of the license of that person  or 
14 midwife.
15 Under the provisions of the bill it is not a defense  that the female individual, or the 
16 parent, guardian or person who has immediate  custody of the female individual, 
17 consented to the procedure  or believed that it was necessary for custom,  religion  or ritual.  
18 It is a defense  that the procedure was necessary to the health  of the female individual or 
19 performed for medical  purposes on a female  individual in labor  or who has just given  
20 birth and was performed  by a person licensed  in this State  by the Board of Licensure in 
21 Medicine or the Board of Osteopathic Licensure or a midwife or a person in an approved  
22 training program  under  the supervision of a physician or midwife licensed in this State.
23 This bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services  to institute a 
24 community outreach program  regarding female genital mutilation for specific 
25 communities in which  female  genital mutilation of minors might be practiced that 
26 provides support  services,  training and educational materials.
