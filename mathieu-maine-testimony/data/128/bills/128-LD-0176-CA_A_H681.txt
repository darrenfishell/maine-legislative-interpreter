SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. 
The amendment authorizes the Board of Trustees of the Maine Public Employees 
Retirement System to procure and offer long-term disability insurance to the retirement 
system's members and employees who choose not to become members but participate in 
the defined contribution plan pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, section 18801, 
subsection 1. The decision about whether to offer coverage is made by the employer. 
Premiums would not be paid for by the retirement system, but would be paid by 
employers, by employees electing the coverage or by a combination of both. 
The amendment also directs the retirement system to report twice to the joint standing 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over retirement matters on the use of the 
authority granted by this bill, once in 2019 and once in 2020.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill authorizes the Maine Public Employees Retirement System (MainePERS) to procure and offer long-term 
disability insurance coverage to its members through their employers. Additional costs to MainePERS associated 
with the rulemaking and reporting requirements can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Because 
participation by employers is optional, there is no fiscal impact to the State, local school administrative units and local 
towns and municipalities that participate in the retirement system.
