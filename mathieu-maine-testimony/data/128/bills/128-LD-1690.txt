31 days of its filing.  The filing of a request for reconsideration stays any time periods  
32 for appeal otherwise set forth in paragraphs B and C, and the time period for appeal 
33 under these paragraphs commences upon receipt of a written notice of a decision  
34 related to the request for reconsideration.   
35 Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §2503, sub-§22  is enacted  to read:
36 22.  Small  cell facilities.  The following  provisions govern small cell facilities.
37 A.  Subsections 3, 4 and 5 do not apply  to applications to collocate small cell

Page 4 - 128LR2613(01)-11 B.  In reviewing  an application and issuing a permit under  this section  for a small cell 
2 facility, the licensing authority shall process  the application and issue the permit for 
3 the facility  in substantially the same  manner as for other facilities and on a 
4 competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory  basis except as set forth  in this 
5 subsection, including with respect to the assessment  of permit  fees, if any.  A 
6 licensing authority may not institute, either expressly or de facto,  a moratorium  on 
7 processing applications or issuing permits for small cell facilities.   A licensing 
8 authority may not, as a condition of issuing  a permit under this section for a small cell 
9 facility, require an applicant  to provide or perform  services unrelated to the permit or 
10 require that a small cell facility be located on a specific pole or other  facility.  If a 
11 licensing authority  adopts a permit by rule process, the process must include  a permit 
12 by rule process for  small cell facilities.
13 C.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary in chapter 23 or this chapter, 
14 a licensing authority  may deny a permit under this section for a small cell facility 
15 only if the  proposed facility:
16 (1)  Fails to comply  with applicable codes;
17 (2)  Obstructs use of the  right-of-way for public travel;
18 (3)  Materially interferes with the safe  operation  of traffic control equipment; or
19 (4)  Materially  interferes  with compliance with the federal Americans with 
20 Disabilities Act of 1990 or similar federal  or state standards regarding pedestrian

28 is no larger than 24 inches in length,  15 inches in width and 12 inches in height  and 
29 that has an exterior antenna, if any, no longer than 11 inches.
30 E.  A licensing authority that charges fees for an application under this section  may 
31 charge a nonrecurring application fee for a small cell facility, as long as the fee does 
32 not exceed the least of:
33 (1)  The actual, direct and reasonable costs to process and review the application,  
34 to the extent the costs are not already recovered by existing fees, rates  or taxes, 
35 and excluding travel expenses  incurred by a 3rd party in its review of an 
36 application and 3rd-party rates or fees charged on a contingency basis or a result-
37 based arrangement;
38 (2)  The application  fee, if any, the licensing authority charges for a location  
39 permit for placing other facilities  in the  public  way;  and
Page 5 - 128LR2613(01)-11 (3) One hundred dollars each for the first 5 small cell facilities requested in an 
2 application and $50 for each additional small cell facility requested in the same  
3 application.
4 Sec. 9.  35-A MRSA §2518, sub-§4,  as enacted  by PL 1987, c. 141, Pt. A, §6, is 
5 amended to read:
6 4.  Exceptions: Long distance lines and small cell facilities.  This section  does not

8 support them.  For the purpose of this section a long distance telephone  wire is a 
9 telephone wire that extends at least  20 miles in a direct line from a  central office.
10 Sec. 10.  35-A MRSA §2524 is  enacted to read:
11 §2524.  Collocation of small cell facilities
12 1.  Limitation.  Except as expressly provided in this chapter,  an authority may not 
13 prohibit, regulate  or charge for the collocation of small cell  facilities.
14 2.  Exclusive arrangements prohibited.  An authority may not enter into an 
15 exclusive arrangement  with any person for: 
16 A.  Use of the public  way for the construction, operation, marketing or maintenance  
17 of small  cell facilities; or
18 B.  The right  to collocate small cell facilities  on authority poles.
19 3.  Rate.  An authority may charge an annual recurring rate of up to $20 per pole for 
20 the collocation  of small cell facilities on authority poles in the  public  way.
21 4.  Description of necessary work.  Within 60 days after receipt of either  an 
22 application under section  2503 to collocate small  cell facilities on an authority  pole or, if 
23 the licensing authority does not own or control the authority pole,  a notice of such an 
24 application, the authority shall  provide the applicant with a description  of any make-ready 
25 work necessary to enable the authority pole to support the requested small  cell facilities, 
26 including pole replacement  if necessary.  If the authority  intends to perform any such 
27 make-ready work, either itself or through an agent, it shall  include  with the description a 
28 good faith estimate of the cost of such work, and it shall  complete such work within 60 
29 days of written acceptance of  the estimate by the applicant.
30 5.  Limitations on work and fees for work.  An authority may not require more 
31 make-ready work on an authority pole than required to meet applicable codes or industry 
32 standards.  An authority  may not require replacement  of an authority pole unless the 
33 authority demonstrates that replacement is required to meet  the codes  or standards.  Fees 
34 for make-ready work  may not exceed  actual costs and must be nondiscriminatory,  
35 competitively neutral and commercially reasonable.   Such fees may not include any 
36 consultants' fees or expenses or costs related to preexisting  or prior  damage or 
37 noncompliance.
38 6.  Decorative poles.   An authority shall  permit a wireless provider  to replace 
39 decorative poles when  necessary to collocate a small cell facility, but any replacement 
Page 6 - 128LR2613(01)-11 pole must reasonably  conform to the design  aesthetics of the decorative pole being 
2 replaced.  As used in this subsection, "decorative pole" means an authority  pole that is 
3 specially designed and placed for aesthetic purposes and on which no appurtenances  or 
4 attachments, other than a small cell facility, specially designed informational or 
5 directional signage  or temporary holiday or special event  attachments, have  been  placed 
6 or are permitted  to be placed according to nondiscriminatory municipal ordinances, rules  
7 or codes.
8 7.  Other locations.  An authority shall allow wireless providers to collocate small 
9 cell facilities  on authority poles that are not located within  the public  way and on wireless 
10 support structures or buildings owned or controlled by the authority to the same extent the 
11 authority permits access to such poles, structures or buildings for other commercial 
12 projects or uses.   Such collocations are subject  to reasonable and nondiscriminatory  rates, 
13 fees, terms and conditions as provided  by ordinance or an agreement between the 
14 authority and the  wireless  provider.
15 8.  Jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding  any other law to the contrary, an authority  does 
16 not have jurisdiction  or authority over the design, engineering, construction,  installation 
17 or operation of any small cell facilities  located inside a building or other structure  or upon 
18 the site of any campus,  stadium or athletic facility  not otherwise owned or controlled by 
19 the authority, other than to enforce  applicable  codes.
20 9.  Power of authority or municipality.  Nothing in this chapter authorizes an 
21 authority to require deployment  of wireless facilities  or to regulate wireless  services.  A 
22 municipality may not require the relocation of small cell facilities under section 2312.
23 10.  Ordinances.  An authority may adopt an ordinance, rule or code  that establishes 
24 rates, fees and other  terms and conditions for wireless  providers that are 
25 nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral and that comply with this chapter.  The 
26 absence of such an ordinance, rule or code may not prevent  or delay a wireless  provider 
27 from collocating small cell facilities pursuant to this chapter.   An ordinance, rule or code 
28 enacted prior to the effective  date of this section that does not comply with this section  
29 and section  2503  is invalid  and unenforceable  beginning on the 181st day after the 
30 effective date of this section; small cell facilities  collocated pursuant to such an 
31 ordinance, rule or code may remain  installed and operated  pursuant to the provisions of 
32 this section.
33 11.  Agreements.  Any agreement between  an authority  and a wireless  provider  that 
34 addresses the collocation of small cell facilities,  that is in effect  on the effective  date of 
35 this section  and that does not comply with this section and section  2503 remains in effect, 
36 subject to any termination provisions in the agreement.   Notwithstanding this subsection,  
37 at the election  of the wireless provider, the agreement  applies only to small cell facilities 
38 that became operational  before the effective date of this section.
39 12.  Construction.  Nothing in this section or section  2503 may be construed  to 
40 authorize a person,  without the consent of the property owner, to collocate a small cell 
41 facility on a pole other than an authority pole,  on a wireless support structure not owned  
42 or controlled  by an authority  or on other  private property.
Page 7 - 128LR2613(01)-11 13.  Indemnification;  insurance.   An authority  may not require a wireless provider  
2 to indemnify the authority  and its officers  and employees, or hold them  harmless, against 
3 any claims, lawsuits,  judgments, costs, liens, losses,  expenses or fees arising from  the 
4 collocation of small cell facilities, except when a court of competent jurisdiction has 
5 found that the negligence of the wireless provider while  collocating  small cell facilities 
6 caused the harm that created the claims,  lawsuits, judgments,  costs, liens, losses, expenses 
7 or fees.  An authority  may not require a wireless provider  to obtain insurance naming the 
8 authority or its officers  and employees an additional insured against  any claims,  lawsuits, 
9 judgments, costs, liens, losses,  expenses or fees arising from the collocation  of small cell 
10 facilities.
11 SUMMARY
12 This bill changes the process for siting small cell facilities in order  to facilitate 
13 wireless broadband deployment,  including: 
14 1.  Through  modifications to the process for issuing utility facility location permits, 
15 including small  cell facility location permits; 
16 2.  Through the establishment of standards governing  local land use ordinances  
17 applicable to the siting of small cell facilities;  and 
18 3.  Through the establishment of standards governing  the collocation of small cell 
19 facilities on poles owned  by the State,  an agency, a county, a  municipality  or a district.
