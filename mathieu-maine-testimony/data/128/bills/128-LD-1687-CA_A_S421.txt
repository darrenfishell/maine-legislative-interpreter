tax document provided at point of purchase. The initial bill of sale is that issued 
by the dealer to the initial purchaser of a new vehicle. 
( 4) For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise 
tax due is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on

amount of money financed or paid by the consumer after application of any 
trade-ins, rebates or discounts or offers or promises that the consumer receive 
back all or a portion of the price paid. Verification of purchase price for the 
application of excise tax is determined by the bill of sale or the state sales tax 
document provided by the dealer at point of purchase. 
For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29-A, section 405, subsection 1, 
paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 
registration.'

This amendment provides that, for a motor vehicle purchased after December 31, 
2018, the motor vehicle excise tax must be based on the purchase price for the motor 
vehicle if purchased from a new vehicle dealer or a used car dealer. For other motor 
vehicles, the excise tax continues to be based on the maker's list price.
