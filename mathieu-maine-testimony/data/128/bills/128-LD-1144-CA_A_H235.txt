COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A,, to H.P. 807, L.D. 1144, Bill, "An Act To 
Support Maine Families by Increasing the Dependent Care Credit" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in §5218 in subsection 3 in the last line (page 1, line 30 in 
L.D.) by inserting after the following: "subsection 1" the following: ', except that for tax 
years beginning on or after January 1, 2017 the credit amount provided by subsections 1, 
2 and 2-A is multiplied by 1.5 if the child care expenses were incurred through the use of 
quality child care services as defined in section 5219-0, subsection 1' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment retains the provisions of the bill that increase the income tax credit 
for child care expenses but amends the provision of current law that doubles the credit 
when the child care expenses are incurred through the use of quality child care services to 
provide that the credit is multiplied by 1.5 in that situation.
