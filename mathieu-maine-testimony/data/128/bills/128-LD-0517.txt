 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §1720, as enacted by PL 2005, c. 242, §1, is amended to read:  2 
§1720.  Nursing facility medical director reimbursement  3 
The department shall include in its calculation of reimburs ement for services 4 
provided by a nursing facility an allowance for  the cost of incurred by the facility for  a 5 
medical director in a base year amount not to exceed $10,000, with that amount being 6 
subject to an annual cost -of-living adjustment . 7 
Sec. 2.  22 M RSA §7863 is enacted to read:  8 
§7863.  Reimbursement for residential care facilities; room and board costs  9 
1.  New construction, acquisitions and renovations.   Notwithstanding any other 10 
law to the contrary, the department shall permit a capital expenditure by a residential care 11 
facility for new construction, an acquisition or a renovation that is less than $2,000,000 12 
and shall provide reimbursement to the facility for the capital expenditure without prior 13 
approval.  The department shall permit a residential care facility to seek and obtain 14 
approval for a capital expenditure that exceeds $2,000,000.  The department shall require 15 
that capital expenditures for energy efficiency improvements, for replacement equipment, 16 
for information systems, for communications systems and for parking lots and garages be 17 
permitted without prior approval and not be counted toward the determination of the 18 
$2,000,000 threshold.  19 
2.  Extraordinary circumstance allowance.   A residential care facility that 20 
experiences an unforeseen and uncontrollable event during a year that results in 21 
unforeseen or uncontrollable increases in expenses may request an adjustment to a 22 
prospective rate in the form of an extraordinary circumstance allowance.  As used in this 23 
subsection, "extraordinary circum stance" includes, but is not limited to, an event of a 24 
catastrophic nature, an increase in minimum wage or social security expenses or 25 
employee retirement contribution expenses in lieu of social security expenses, a change in 26 
the number of licensed beds an d a change in licensure or accreditation requirements.  If 27 
the department concludes that an extraordinary circumstance existed, the department shall 28 
make an adjustment in the form of a supplemental allowance.  The department shall 29 
determine from the nature  of the extraordinary circumstance whether the extraordinary 30 
circumstance will have a continuing impact and whether the allowance should be 31 
included in the computation of the base rate for the succeeding year.  Reimbursement to a 32 
residential care facility for additional costs arising from an extraordinary circumstance 33 
must be paid via a supplemental payment that is added to the per diem reimbursement 34 
rate until the department adjusts the direct care price, the routine limit and the personal 35 
care services li mit, as applicable, to fairly and properly reimburse a facility for these 36 
costs.  37 
3.  Regulatory compliance costs.   Costs incurred by a residential care facility to 38 
comply with changes in federal or state laws, regulations and rules and not otherwise 39 
specif ied in rules adopted by the department are considered reasonable and necessary 40 
costs.  Reimbursement for these additional regulatory costs must be paid via a 41 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0975(01) -1 
 supplemental payment that is added to the per diem rate until the department adjusts the 1 
direct ca re price, the routine limit and the personal care services limit, as applicable, to 2 
fairly and properly reimburse facilities for these costs.  3 
4.  Rulemaking.   The department shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 4 
adopted pursuant to this subse ction are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 5 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 6 
SUMMARY  7 
This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to permit capital 8 
expenditures by residential care facilities for new construction, acquisitions an d 9 
renovations that are less than $2,000,000 and to provide reimbursement without prior 10 
approval.  It requires the department to provide an extraordinary circumstance allowance 11 
in permitted reimbursement to residential care facilities.  It provides that cos ts incurred by 12 
a residential care facility to comply with federal or state laws, regulations and rules are 13 
considered reasonable and necessary costs.  It removes from current law on 14 
reimbursement for services provided by a nursing facility the $10,000 cap for the cost of 15 
a medical director and instead requires the department to provide in its calculation of 16 
reimbursement for services the cost incurred by the nursing facility for the cost of a 17 
medical director.  18
