This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $2,500,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 to the 
Student Assistance Program within the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME). According to FAME, this increase in 
funding may result in an additional 1, 100 new students receiving the minimum $1,500 grant award. 
This legislation also increases the minimum grant amount that may be awarded to eligible students under the Maine 
State Grant Program from $1,000 to $1,500. Because the average award for full-time students is currently $1,500, this 
change in the minimum grant amount will not affect the grant awards to current recipients. In general, however, an 
increase in the minimum grant amount that may be awarded under the Maine State Grant Program will lower the 
number of grants that can be awarded.
