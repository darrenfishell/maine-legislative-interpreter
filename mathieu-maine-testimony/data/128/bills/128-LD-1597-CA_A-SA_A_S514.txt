The amendment delays the effective date of the bill to provide an exclusion from sales tax of the paint stewardship 
assessment. The incremental impact of the amendment is to reduce the General Fund revenue loss by $34,300 in fiscal 
year 2017-18 and by $37,044 in fiscal year 2018-19, and to reduce the Local Government Fund revenue loss by $700 
in fiscal year 2017-18 and by $756 in fiscal year 2018-19. As amended, the bill would decrease General Fund revenue 
by $34,300 in fiscal year 2018-19 and decrease Local Government Fund revenue by $700 in fiscal year 2018-19.
