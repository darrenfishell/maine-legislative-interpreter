7 operate as approved private schools without undergoing the Department of Education's 
8 basic school approval process or meeting the requirements of the system of learning 
9 results if they are accredited by a New England association of schools and colleges. The 
10 amendment also requires a private school that enrolls 60% or more publicly funded 
11 students to meet the requirements of the system of learning results before being approved 
12 for receipt of public funds for tuition purposes.
