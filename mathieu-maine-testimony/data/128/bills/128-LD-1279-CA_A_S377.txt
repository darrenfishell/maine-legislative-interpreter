12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment is the minority report of the committee and replaces the bill. Like 
14 the bill, the amendment allows children younger than 26 years of age to remain on their 
15 parents' health insurance policy. The amendment adds provisions not included in the bill 
16 to make the change also applicable to group health plans and health maintenance 
17 organization individual and group health plans. 
18 The amendment retains the provision in the bill prohibiting individual, group and 
19 blanket health plans from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion on any enrollee, but 
20 adds language to allow a carrier to restrict enrollment in individual health plans to open 
21 enrollment and special enrollment periods established in rule. 
22 The amendment clarifies that carriers offering individual or group health plans may 
23 not establish lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits. The amendment 
24 specifies that the provision prohibiting annual limits on the dollar value of benefits 
25 applies to the dollar value of essential health benefits as determined by the 
26 Superintendent of Insurance to the extent not inconsistent with federal law.
