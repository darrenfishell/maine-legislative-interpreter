16 how it is likely to affect solar installations. The commission shall address how the 
17 recommendation compares to the current net energy billing practice in terms of ratepayer 
18 impacts and the rate at which customer-sited solar photovoltaic installations are occurring 
19 in the State. 
20 In looking at rate design options, the commission, in consultation with solar 
21 installers, transmission and distribution utilities, the Governor's Energy Office and the 
22 Public Advocate, shall compile the best available data on the energy production from 
23 customer-sited solar photovoltaic installations or other distributed generation resources in
