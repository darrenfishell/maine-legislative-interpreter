SUMMARY  15 
This bill creates a tax credit for owners of low -income housing developments that  16 
qualify for tax credits under federal law and are financed with tax -exempt bonds, located 17 
in the State and determined by the Maine State Housing Authority to be eligible for a 18 
federal tax credit whether or not a federal tax credit is allocated to the deve lopment. A 19 
taxpayer who receives the credit must agree to enter a restrictive covenant to maintain 20 
and operate the development as low -income housing and follow various federal 21 
requirements for 15 years.  The state tax credit is for 6 years and has a recapt ure provision 22 
if the basis of the development goes below a certain amount.  An insurance company is 23 
allowed to apply the credit against the company's insurance premium tax.  The Maine 24 
State Housing Authority is required annually to report various details o f the qualified 25 
developments that received a credit for the prior tax year.  26
