13 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 841, L.D. 1205 
The first required modification is the removal of the requirement that a provider bill 
only for days on which a member is receiving per diem home support at 11 :59 p.m. The 
rule must also clarify that there is no requirement that a provider bill only for days on 
which a member is physically present in the home at 11 : 5 9, to account for times when the 
member may be temporarily away from the home, for instance on a family visit. The 
modification must also clarify that on days when a member is transitioning between 
providers of home support, only the provider providing home support at 11 :59 may bill 
for home support. 
The 2nd required modification relates to documentation for the audit of services 
provided. The proposed rule requires documentation showing the hours and the name of 
the direct staff scheduled to work with the member. The required modification returns 
the rule to the current requirement that documentation show the hours and the name of 
the direct staff scheduled to work at the facility.
