Cunent biennium savings -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Extending the ineligible period for falsifying an application for general assistance from 120 days to 24 months will 
reduce assistance payments made by municipalities and reduce amounts reimbursed to municipalities by the 
Department of Health and Human Services. The savings to the department is not expected to be significant because 
the frequency of falsification is very small and recipients typically do not stay in the program, having to reapply each 
month they seek help. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible because recipient data related to 
number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number ofrecipients who return and the frequency of 
falsification resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
