SUMMARY  31 
This bill makes changes to the laws regarding licensure for professional engineers.  32 
It amends the definition of "technology accreditation commission" to provide that  it is 33 
an engineering technology accreditation commission.  34 
It updates references to codes and standards governing persons engaged in the design 35 
of minor construction.  36 
It provides for the electronic updating of the roster of active licensed professional 37 
engineers.  38 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0769(01) -1 
 It allows the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers to grant licensure to 1 
applicants from other jurisdictions who have been licensed in good standing for at least 2 
10 years and whose qualifications are substantially equivalent to those  required by the 3 
State.  It also clarifies language usage and makes changes to provide consistency.  4 
It changes the laws regarding practice by nonresidents by moving from allowing for 5 
exceptions to licensure to providing for temporary licensure.  6 
It removes the requirement for 4 years of engineering work experience prior to taking 7 
the national examination on the principles and practices of engineering.  It also removes 8 
the requirement for individuals who fail the exam 3 times to reapply and provide proof of 9 
further experience or study.  10 
It removes the requirement for professional development.  It also removes a reference 11 
to a subcommittee of the board.  12
