permit when it finds that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed activity meets 3 
the standards set forth in subsections 1 to 11, except that when an activity requires a  4 
permit only because it  is located in, on or over a community public water system primary 5 
protection area the department shall issue a permit when it finds that  and does not 6 
otherwise require a permit pursuant to section 480 -C the applicant has demonstrate d must 7

marine fisheries or other aquatic l ife. 15 
In determining whether mining, as defined in section 490 -MM, subsection 11, will 16 
comply with this subsection, the department shall review an analysis of alternatives 17 
submitted by the applicant.  For purposes of this subsection, a practicable alternati ve to 18

environment is not considered to exist.  The department may consider alternatives 20

evaluation of whether the activity avoided and minimized impacts to the maximum extent 22 
practicable.  23 
In determining whether there is unreasonable harm to significant wildlife habitat, the 24 
department may consider proposed mitigation if that mitigation does not diminish in the 25 
vicinity of the proposed activity the overall value of significant wildlife habitat and 26 
species utilization of the habitat and if there is no specific biological or physical feature 27 
unique to the habitat that would be adversely aff ected by the proposed activity.  For 28 
purposes of this subsection, "mitigation" means any action taken or not taken to avoid,  29 
minimize, rectify, reduce, eliminate or compensate for any actual or potential adverse 30 
impact on the significant wildlife habitat, including the following:  31

B.  Minimizing an impact by limiting the magnitude, duration or location of an 33 
activity or by controlling the timing of an activity;  34 
C.  Rectif ying an impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected 35 
environment;  36 
D.  Reducing or eliminating an impact over time through preservation and 37 
maintenance operations during the life of the project; or  38 
E.  Compensating for an impact by replacin g the affected significant wildlife habitat.  39

underlying ground water is  utilized by a community public water system as a source of 2 
supply, the applicant for the permit shall, at the time of filing an application, forward a 3 
copy of the application to the community public water system and the drinking water 4 
program of the Depar tment of Health and Human Services by certified  mail and the 5

§480 -E-2.  Delegation of review authority to the Department of Health and Human 11 
Services or to a community public water  system  12 
The commissioner may delegate review authority to determine whether an activity 13 
that requires a permit because it  is located within a community public water system 14 
primary protection area meets the standards in section 480 -D, subsections 2 and 5 if  the 15 
activity does not in whole or in part otherwise require a permit pursuant to section 480 -C.  16 
The commissioner may only delegate this review authority to the drinking water program 17

embedded in the stream bottom a minimum of one foot or at least 25% of the 35 
culvert or other structure's diameter, whichever is greater, except that a crossing 36 
structure does not have to b e embedded more than 2 feet.  37

coastal sand dune system is destroyed or threatened, th e owner of property protected by 26 
the seawall, bulkhead, retaining wall or similar structure may perform or cause to be 27 
performed the following activities without obtaining a permit under this article:  28 
A.  Place riprap, sandbags or other heavy nonhazardous material to shore up the 29 
threatened structure and leave the material in place until a project designed to repair 30 
or replace the structure is permitted by the department.  After such emergency action 31 
is taken and within 5 working days after the imminent thr eat, the property owner 32 
must provide written notice to the department of the date the emergency action was 33 
taken and a description of the emergency action taken.  Within 6 months following 34

permit is issued by the department; or  38 
B.  Make permanent repairs, to th e extent necessary to alleviate the threat, to 39

footings or to secure the structure to the sand with tie -back anchors.  A state-certified 41 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR0981(01) -1 
 geologist,  state-licensed professiona l engineer or other qualified professional must 1 
make the determination that the actions taken by the property owner in accordance 2 
with this section are only those actions necessary to alleviate the imminent threat and 3 
do not include increasing the height o r length of the structure.  4 
If a local code enforcement officer , or state-licensed professional engineer or state - 5 
certified geologist  fails to determine within 6 hours of initial contact by the property 6 
owner whether the integrity of a structure is destroye d or threatened, the property owner 7 
may proceed as if the local code enforcement officer , or state-licensed professional 8 
engineer or state -certified geologist  had determined that the integrity of the structure was 9 
destroyed or threatened.  10

feet of aquatic vegetation, emergent marsh vegetation or open water;  15 
SUMMARY  16 
This bill amends the Natural Resources Protection Act in several ways.  17 
1.  It excludes artificial turf from the definition of "impervious area."  18 
2.  It amends the definition of "river, stream or brook" to provide that a channel must 19 
have all 5 of the characteristics listed in the definition.  Current law requires that a 20 
channel must have at least 2 of the characteristics listed.  21 
3.  It amends the definition of "significant ground water well" to provide that public 22 
water systems are not significant groundwater wells.  23 
4.  It increases from 20,000 to 80,000 square feet the area of aquatic vegetation, 24 
emergent marsh vegetation or open water that a freshwater wetland must contain before  a 25 
person is required to get a permit from the Department of Environmental Protection for 26 
activities adjacent to the freshwater wetland.  27 
5.  It provides that a person is not required to obtain a Natural Resources Protection 28 
Act permit from the Department o f Environmental Protection for the establishment or 29 
operation of a significant groundwater well for a community public water system.  30 
6.  For determining if an activity unreasonably harms habitats or fisheries, it amends 31 
the definition of "mitigation" to pr ovide that the Department of Environmental Protection 32 
may not consider whether an adverse impact of an activity can be avoided.  33 
7.  It amends the notification and comment requirements when a resource is used by a 34 
community public water system as a source o f water supply.  35 
8.  It provides that the Department of Environmental Protection may only delegate 36 
review authority to the Department of Health and Human Services, Drinking Water 37 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR0981(01) -1 
 Program or to a community public water system when an activity is located with in a 1 
community public water system primary protection area and the activity does not 2 
otherwise require a Department of Environmental Protection permit under the Natural 3 
Resources Protection Act.  It also removes the requirement to obtain a permit from the 4 
Department of Environmental Protection in such cases.  5 
9.  It includes existing water or sewer lines, culverts and natural gas pipelines in the 6 
permit exemption for existing crossings.  7 
10.  It provides that a replacement of existing public works does not re quire a Natural 8 
Resources Protection Act permit and it provides that the public works exemption applies 9 
to outstanding river segments.  10 
11.  It amends the exemption for activities that alter less than 4,300 square feet of 11 
freshwater wetlands.  12 
12.  It remove s state -certified geologists from the list of professionals that may 13 
determine whether the integrity of a seawall or similar structure in a coastal sand dune 14 
system is destroyed or threatened for purposes of repairing the seawall or structure.  15 
13.  It amen ds the activities that are not eligible for Tier 1 or Tier 2 review when 16 
altering freshwater wetlands.  17
