Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill extends to 2026 the income tax credit for dentists who practice in underserved areas and increases the number 
of primary care professionals who may be certified for the primaiy care access credit. It would result in a reduction in 
General Fund revenue of $47,040 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $129,360 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a reduction in Local 
Government Fund revenue of $960 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $2,640 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services from the provisions of this bill are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
