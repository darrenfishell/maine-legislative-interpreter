SUMMARY  33 
This bill creates the crime of child abuse.  Child abuse occurs when a person 34 
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly neglects or abuses a child.  The sentencing classes 35 
for the crime of child abuse range from a Class C crime to a Class A crime, depending on 36 
the severity of the abuse and the level of intentionality of the person infl icting the abuse.  37 
The bill repeals several provisions regarding endangering the welfare of a child that have 38 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0579(01) -1 
 been incorporated into the crime of child abuse.  It also requires expert testimony from a 1 
licensed physician who has completed an accredited resi dency in psychiatry or a licensed 2 
psychologist to establish mental injury in a child abuse case.  3
