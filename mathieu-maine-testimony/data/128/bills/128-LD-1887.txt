Page 1 - 128LR2981(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  26 MRSA  ยง1221, sub-ยง4-B is enacted to read:
3 4-B.  Shared cost assessment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 
4 contrary, beginning January 1, 2019, employers in contribution categories 19 and 20 in 
5 the table in subsection 4, paragraph  B, subparagraph (2) shall pay a shared cost 
6 assessment tax, referred  to in this paragraph  as "the shared cost assessment," to 
7 supplement, and not supplant,  contributions.  The shared cost assessment is 15% of an 
8 employer's taxable payroll for contribution category  19 and 20% of an employer's taxable 
9 payroll for contribution category 20.
10 A.  The shared cost assessment is due and payable at the same  time and in the same 
11 manner as  contributions.
12 B.  The Director of Unemployment Compensation shall enforce collection of any 
13 shared cost assessment in the same manner as provided in this chapter for collection  
14 of contributions.
15 C.  Revenue generated by the shared cost assessment must be  deposited in the fund.
16 SUMMARY
17 This bill amends the laws governing  employer  contributions for unemployment  
18 compensation to impose an additional shared  cost assessment tax on employers  in 
19 contribution categories 19 and 20, increasing  the percentage of unemployment tax paid 
20 by those employers.   Beginning January  1, 2019, an employer in category 19 is assessed  
21 an additional  unemployment  tax of 15% of that employer's  taxable payroll and an 
22 employer in category 20 is assessed  an additional unemployment tax of 20% of that 
23 employer's taxable payroll.  Adding this shared  cost assessment provides  benefit  costs 
24 beyond the normal experience rating process to the Unemployment  Compensation Fund.
