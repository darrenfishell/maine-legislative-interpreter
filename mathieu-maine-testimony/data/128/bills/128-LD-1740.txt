9 labor or services having economic value;

21 value;
22 F.  Compels a person to provide labor or services having economic value  to retire,

11 2.  Criminal forced labor  is a Class C  crime.
12 §305.  Aggravated criminal forced labor

27 economic value  through certain  coercive  acts.  A person is guilty of aggravated criminal 
28 forced labor if the person compelled to provide  labor or services has not in fact attained 
29 18 years of  age.
