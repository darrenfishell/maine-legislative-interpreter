designation, from paying incentives for selling used vehicles with no unremedied 16 
recalls or from paying incentives for performing recall repairs on a vehicle in the 17 
dealer's inventory.  18 
Nothing in this paragraph prevents a manufacturer fr om instructing a dealer to repair 19 
used vehicles of the line make for which the dealer holds a franchise with an open 20 
recall, as long as the instruction does not involve coercion that imposes a penalty or 21

sales performance of a dealer for any purpose, including loss of incentive payments 24 
or other benefits, claim of breach or threats thereof or notice of termination or threats 25 
thereof, for the period of time that the manufacturer has established an agreement, 26

repair used vehicles of the line m ake for which the dealer holds a franchise with an 2 
open recall as long as the instruction does not involve coercion that imposes a penalty 3 
or provision of loss of benefits on the dealer.  4

statistical determination of sales performance or sales and service customer 6 
satisfaction performance for any period of time during which the dealer has at least 7 
5% of its new motor vehicle inventory subject to a recall, stop sale directive or do n ot 8 
drive directive and for 90 days after the end of such a period of time. Within 30 days 9 
of application for adjustment, the manufacturer shall use reasonable efforts to review 10 
and adjust the data, calculations or other statistical determinations back to t he date the 11 
dealer was prevented from selling the new motor vehicles. The manufacturer has the 12 
burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the prevention of sale did 13 
not have a material, adverse effect on the dealer's new vehicle sales performa nce or 14 
sales and service customer satisfaction performance, and the adjustments by the 15 
manufacturer must remediate the effect shown on the data, calculations or statistical 16 
determinations of sales performance or sales and service customer satisfaction 17 
performance.  18 
The manufacturer shall take into consideration any adjustments to a dealer's new 19 
vehicle sales performance or sales and service customer satisfaction performance 20 
made by the manufacturer under this paragraph in determining a dealer's compliance 21 
with a performance standard or program.  22 
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit in any way the rights of a dealer under 23

from the date of acquisition of control by that successor manufacturer, to offer a franchise 28 
to any person for a line make of a predecessor manufacturer in any franchise market area 29 
in which the predecess or manufacturer previously cancelled, terminated, noncontinued, 30 
failed to renew or otherwise ended a franchise agreement with a franchisee who had a 31 
franchise facility in that franchise market area without first offering the franchise to the 32 
former franchi see at no cost, unless:  33 
A.  Within 30 days of the former franchisee's cancellation, termination, 34 
noncontinuance or nonrenewal, the predecessor manufacturer had consolidated the 35 
line make with another of its line makes for which the predecessor manufacturer  had 36 
a franchisee with a then -existing franchise facility in that franchise market area;  37 
B.  The successor manufacturer has paid the former franchisee the fair market value 38 
of the former franchisee's motor vehicle dealership in accordance with this 39 
subsect ion; or  40 
C.  The successor manufacturer proves that the former franchisee is not competent to 41

miles of the territorial limits of the municipality in w hich the former franchisee's 2 
franchise facility was located.  3 
For purposes of this subsection, the fair market value of a former franchisee's motor 4 
vehicle dealership must be calculated as of the date of the following that yields the 5 
highest fair market va lue:  the date the predecessor manufacturer announced the action 6 
that resulted in the cancellation, termination, noncontinuance or nonrenewal; the date the 7 
action that resulted in cancellation, termination, noncontinuance or nonrenewal became 8 
final; or the  date 12 months prior to the date that the predecessor manufacturer announced 9 
the action that resulted in the cancellation, termination, noncontinuance or nonrenewal; 10 
and 11

dealer, this disclosure must be clear and conspicuous.  For the purpose of this section, 18 
"lemon law" refers to any state's certified dispute settlement law that est ablishes a 19 
state-certified arbitration procedure to settle consumer complaints that the consumer 20 
had been sold a vehicle that did not conform to all manufacturer express warranties 21

Sec. 5.  10 MRSA §1174 -C, sub -§1, ¶A, as ame nded by PL 2003, c. 356, §9, is 3 
further amended to read:  4

dealer in the ownership or operation of the dealership under the existing franchise or 9 
distribution agreement if the designated family member gives the manufacturer, 10 
distributor, factory branch, factory representative or importer , wholesaler, distributor 11 
branch or distributor representative  of new motor vehicles written notice of the 12 
intention to succeed to the de alership within 120 days of the dealer's death, incapacity 13

importer , wholesaler, di stributor branch or distributor representative .  The 16 
manufacturer has the burden of demonstrating good cause by clear and convincing 17 
evidence.  18 
Sec. 6.  10 MRSA §1176 -A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 534, §8, is further 19 
amended by adding at the end a new paragr aph to read:  20 
A franchisor may not deny those elements of a paid claim or customer or dealer 21 
incentive that are based on a dealer's incidental failure to comply with a claim 22 
requirement or a clerical error or other technicality, regardless of whether the fr anchisor 23 
contests any other element of that claim, as long as the dealer corrects the clerical error or 24 
other technicality according to licensee guidelines.  25 
SUMMARY  26 
This bill makes it an unfair and deceptive practice for a motor vehicle manufacturer 27 
to use  unreasonable performance standards in assessing motor vehicle dealer compliance 28 
with franchise agreements, to require a dealer to refrain from selling a new or used motor 29 
vehicle when there is no remedy to a recall without the manufacturer's providing 30 
compensation or to prohibit a dealer from providing to a consumer information of a 31 
defective condition in a motor vehicle when the vehicle is being repaired under a 32 
manufacturer's warranty.  It clarifies the standard of review in succession planning and in 33 
the analysis by a manufacturer of a dealer's sales and incentive performance.  34
