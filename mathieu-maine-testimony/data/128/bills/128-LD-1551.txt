1.  Filing.  If Before August 1, 2017, if  any tax imposed by this Title or imposed by 34 
any other provision of law and authorized to be collected by the bureau is not paid  when 35 
due and no further administrative or judicial review of the assessment is available 36 
pursuant to law, the assessor may file in the registry of deeds of any county, with respect 37 
to real property, or in the office of the Secretary of State, with respect  to property of a 38

 Page 2 - 128LR0721(01) -1 
 costs due, the name and last known address of the person l iable for the amount and, in the 1 
case of a tax imposed by this Title, the fact that the assessor has complied with all the 2 
provisions of this Title in the assessment of the tax.  The lien arises at the time the 3 
assessment becomes final and constitutes a li en upon all property, whether real or 4 
personal, then owned or thereafter acquired by that person in the period before the 5 
expiration of the lien.  The lien imposed by this section is not valid against any 6 
mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, judgment creditor or  holder of a properly recorded 7 
security interest until notice of the lien has been filed by the assessor, with respect to real 8 
property, in the registry of deeds of the county where such property is located and, with 9 
respect to personal property, in the of fice in which a financing statement for such 10 
personal property is normally filed.  Notwithstanding this subsection, a tax lien upon 11 
personal property does not extend to those types of personal property not subject to 12 
perfection of a security interest by me ans of the filing in the office of the Secretary of 13 
State.  The lien is prior to any mortgage or security interest recorded, filed or otherwise 14 
perfected after the notice, other than a purchase money security interest perfected in 15 
accordance with Title 11,  Article 9 -A.  In the case of any mortgage or security interest 16 
properly recorded or filed prior to the notice of lien that secures future advances by the 17 
mortgagee or secured party, the lien is junior to all advances made within 45 days after 18 
filing of th e notice of lien, or made without knowledge of the lien or pursuant to a 19 
commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.  Subject to the limitations in this 20 
section, the lien provided in this section  subsection  has the same force, effect and priorit y 21 
as a judgment lien and continues for 10 years from the date of recording unless sooner 22 
released or otherwise discharged.  The lien may, within the 10 -year period, or within 10 23 
years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the manner provided i n this 24 
subsection, be extended by filing for record in the appropriate office a copy of the notice 25 
and, from the time of filing, that lien must be extended for 10 years unless sooner 26 
released or otherwise discharged.  27 
This subsection applies to assessments made before August 1, 2017.  28 
Sec. A -3.  36 MRSA §175 -A, sub -§1-A is enacted to read:  29 
1-A.  Filing of tax lien.  Beginning August 1, 2017, if any tax imposed by this Title 30 
or any tax imposed by any other provision of law and authorized to be collected by the  31 
bureau is not paid when due and no further administrative or judicial review of the 32 
assessment is available pursuant to law, the amount of the assessment, including the tax, 33 
interest, penalties and costs, is a lien in favor of the assessor. The lien arise s at the time 34 
the assessment is made and constitutes a lien upon all property, whether real or personal, 35 
owned by the person liable for the assessment at the time the lien arises or acquired by 36 
that person in the period after the lien arises until the expi ration of the lien. The assessor 37 
may file in the registry of deeds of any county, with respect to real property, or in the 38 
office of the Secretary of State, with respect to property of a type for which a security 39 
interest may be perfected by a filing in su ch office under Title 11, Article 9 -A, a notice of 40 
lien specifying the amount of the tax, interest, penalties and costs due, the name and last 41 
known address of the person liable for the amount and, in the case of a tax imposed by 42 
this Title, the fact that the assessor has complied with all the provisions of this Title in the 43 
assessment of the tax. Filing of the lien by the assessor constitutes notice of lien for, and 44 
secures payment of, both the original assessment and all subsequent assessments of tax 45 
 
 Page 3 - 128LR0721(01) -1 
 against the same person, until such time as the lien is released or otherwise discharged as 1 
provided for in this section. The lien imposed by this section is not valid against any 2 
mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, judgment creditor or holder of a properly recorde d 3 
security interest until notice of the lien has been filed by the assessor, with respect to real 4 
property, in the registry of deeds of the county where such property is located and, with 5 
respect to personal property, in the office in which a financing sta tement for such 6 
personal property is normally filed. Notwithstanding this subsection, a tax lien upon 7 
personal property does not extend to those types of personal property not subject to 8 
perfection of a security interest by means of the filing in the offic e of the Secretary of 9 
State. The lien is prior to any mortgage or security interest recorded, filed or otherwise 10 
perfected after the notice, other than a purchase -money security interest perfected in 11 
accordance with Title 11, Article 9 -A and except as prov ided in Part 2. In the case of any 12 
mortgage or security interest properly recorded or filed prior to the notice of lien that 13 
secures future advances by the mortgagee or secured party, the lien is junior to all 14 
advances made within 45 days after filing of t he notice of lien, or made without 15 
knowledge of the lien or pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the 16 
lien. Subject to the limitations in this section, the lien provided in this subsection has the 17 
same force, effect and priority as a j udgment lien and continues for 10 years from the date 18 
of recording unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. The lien may, within the 19 
10-year period, or within 10 years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the 20 
manner provided in this su bsection, be extended by filing for record in the appropriate 21 
office a copy of the notice and, from the time of filing, that lien must be extended for 10 22 
years unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. If the lien is extended within the 23 
10-year perio d, or within 10 years from the date of the last extension of the lien as 24 
provided for in this subsection, the extended lien relates back to the date the lien was first 25 
filed.  26 
This subsection applies to assessments made on or after August 1, 2017.  27 
Sec. A -4.  36 MRSA §175 -A, sub -§3, as amended by PL 1997, c. 526, §10, is 28 
further amended to read:  29 
3.  Enforcement.   The lien provided for by subsection 1 or 1-A may be enforced at 30 
any time after the tax liability with respect to which the lien arose becomes collec tible 31 
under section 173, subsection 1 by a civil action brought by the Attorney General in the 32 
name of the State in the Superior Court of the county in which the property is located to 33 
subject any property, of whatever nature, in which the taxpayer has any  right, title or 34 
interest, to the payment of such tax or liability.  The court shall, after the parties have 35 
been duly notified of the action, proceed to adjudicate all matters involved in the action 36 
and finally determine the merits of all claims to and li ens upon the property and, in all 37 
cases where a claim or interest of the State therein is established, may decree a sale of the 38 
property by the proper officer of the court and a distribution of the proceeds of such sale 39 
according to the findings of the cou rt.  If the property is sold to satisfy a lien held by the 40 
State, the State may bid at the sale such sum, not exceeding the amount of that lien plus 41 
expenses of sale, as the assessor directs.  42 
Sec. A -5.  36 MRSA §175 -A, sub -§4, as corrected by RR 1997, c. 1 , §28, is 43

 4.  Recording fees part of tax liability.   Fees paid by the assessor to registrars of 1 
deeds for recording notices of lien pursuant to subsection 1 or 1-A and notices of release 2 
of a lien pursuant to subsection 2 may be added to t he tax liability that gave rise to the 3 
lien and, in the case of a tax imposed by this Title, may be collected by all the methods 4 
provided for in chapter 7.  In the case of other obligations owed to the State and 5 
authorized to be collected by the bureau, th e fees may be collected by any collection 6 
method authorized by this section or section 176 -A. 7 
Sec. A -6.  36 MRSA §186, first ¶, as amended by PL 2009, c. 625, §3, is further 8 
amended to read:  9 
 A person who fails to pay any tax, other than a tax imposed purs uant to chapter 105, 10 
on or before the last date prescribed for payment is liable for interest on the tax, 11 
calculated from that date and compounded monthly.   The rate of interest for any calendar 12 
year equals the highest prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the first day 13 
of September of the preceding calendar year or, if the first day of September falls on a 14 
weekend or holiday, on the next succeeding business day, rounded up to the next whole 15 
percent plus 3 percentage points.  The rate of in terest for any calendar year beginning on 16 
or after January 1, 2018 equals the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on 17 
the first day of September of the preceding calendar year or, if the first day of September 18 
falls on a weekend or holiday, o n the next succeeding business day, rounded up to the 19 
next whole percent plus one percentage point.   For purposes of this section, the last date 20 
prescribed for payment of tax must be determined without regard to any extension of time 21 
permitted for filing a  return.  A tax that is upheld on administrative or judicial review 22 
bears interest from the date on which payment would have been due in the absence of 23 
review.  Any amount that has been erroneously refunded and is recoverable by the 24 
assessor bears interest  at the rate determined pursuant to this section from the date of 25 
payment of the refund.  A credit or reimbursement that has been allowed or paid pursuant 26 
to this Title and is recoverable by the assessor bears interest at the rate determined 27 
pursuant to th is section from the date it was allowed or paid.  Interest accrues 28 
automatically, without being assessed by the assessor, and is recoverable by the assessor 29 
in the same manner as if it were a tax assessed under this Title.  If the failure to pay a tax 30 
when  required is explained to the satisfaction of the assessor, the assessor may abate or 31 
waive the payment of all or any part of that interest.  32
