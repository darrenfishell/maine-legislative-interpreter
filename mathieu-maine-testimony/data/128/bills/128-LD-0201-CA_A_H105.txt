Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Currently a lobster license holder may increase the number of trap tags purchased by 100 tags per year, up to a 
maximum limit of either 800 trap tags or the maximum zone limit in which the license is issued. This bill would 
allow licensees to purchase up to the maximum number of tags that person had ever held, up to the 800 trap limit, 
removing the annual limit increase being tied to the immediately prior year. 
The Department of Marine Resources estimates that this bill will reduce the number oflobster trap tags purchased 
annually by lobster license holders. The department estimates that up to 600,000, or 20%, of the total number of 
lobster trap tags sold are in excess of the licensees' fishing requirements and are purchased solely to maintain the 
licensees' maximum tag quota. The department estimates a loss of between $150,000 and $300,000 in annual Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Lobster Management Fund, starting in fiscal year 2018-19 and this fiscal note 
has assumed the revenue loss at $225,000. 
This bill will require significant programming and development changes to the Licensing Enforcement and 
Environmental Data System (LEEDS), the departments' online licensing and landings management system. The bill 
includes a one-time allocation of $50,000 to implement these changes. The Lobster Management Fund has sufficient 
resources to fund the additional allocation.
