SUMMARY  29 
This bill sets at 425 the number of elver fishing licenses issued each year , not 30 
including licenses issued to federally recognized Indian tribes.  The bill requires the 31 
Commissioner of Marine Resources to hold a lottery for elver fishing licenses through 32 
which a person who did not possess an elver fishing license in the previous year may 33 
become eligible to obtain one.  The bill establishes a minimum allocation of elver quota 34 
to each elver fishing license holder of 4 pounds, unless that amount causes the State to 35 
exceed its overall annual quota set by the Atlantic States Marine Fis heries Commission.  36 
The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules that provide a method for redistributing 37 
quotas allocated to deceased elver fishing license holders or license holders who for 38 
another reason will not fish those quotas.  39
