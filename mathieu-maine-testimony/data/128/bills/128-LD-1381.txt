SUMMARY  31 
This bill amends the laws regarding municipal boards of appeal and regarding 32 
appeals of municipal land use decisions to reflect the holding of the Law Court in "Susan 33

ripe for appeal.  It provides that a final decision occurs when an application has received 35

planning board or munic ipal review authority, a site plan or design review board, a 37 
historic preservation review board and any other review board created by municipal 38 
charter or ordinance and that an appeal to the Superior Court may not be made until a 39 
final decision occurs.  40
