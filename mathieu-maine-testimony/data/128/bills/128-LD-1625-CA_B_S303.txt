counted on the day immediately following the election, as long as the count is completed

described in section 723-A. The Secretary of State shall tabulate the votes that appear by 
an election return to have been cast for a declared write-in candidate based on a recount 
requested and conducted pursuant to section 737-A, subsection 2-A. 
Sec. 5. 21-A MRSA §723, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2009, c. 253, §38, is 
further amended to read:

except for write-in candidates under paragraph A. 
A. A write-in candidate who complies with either section 722-A or section 737-A, 
subsection 2-A and who fulfills the other qualifications under section 334, may be 
nominated at the primary election if that person receives a number of valid write-in 
votes equal to at least twice the minimum number of signatures required under 
section 335, subsection 5, on a primary petition for a candidate for that office. 
B. The Secretary of State shall immediately certify by mail the nomination of each 
person nominated by the primary election.

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. This amendment does not affect the use of the 
ranked-choice voting method for the primary nomination elections to the office of the 
Governor and to the Legislature. The amendment requires the ratification of an 
amendment to the Constitution of Maine that approves the use of the ranked-choice 
voting method for those offices before that method may be used. 
This amendment requires the Secretary of State to adopt routine technical rules for 
the administration of ranked-choice voting, including the administration of recounts. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
