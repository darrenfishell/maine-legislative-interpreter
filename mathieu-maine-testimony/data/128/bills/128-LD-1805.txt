17 SUMMARY
18 This bill does the following:
19 Part A expands the provision for sellers required to register to collect and report sales  
20 taxes to include online real property  rental platforms  and those engaged in the facilitation 
21 of the rental of living  quarters.  Definitions  for "room remarketer," "transient rental 
22 platform" and "facilitation of the rental  of living quarters"  are added.   The definition of 
23 "sale price" is amended to include as consideration  receipts by room remarketers  and 
24 transient rental  platform  operators.   The definition of "taxable service" is amended to 
25 include facilitation of the rental of living quarters  in a hotel,  rooming house or tourist or 
26 trailer camp.  It restructures  and reorganizes the section of law specifying the rate of sales 
27 tax.  The clarification  regarding  the registration  requirements for the rental  of living 
28 quarters takes  effect 90 days after adjournment  of the Second Regular Session  of the 
29 128th Legislature.   The changes apply to sales  occurring on  or after October  1, 2018;
30 Part B:
31 1.  Limits insurance premium tax refunds  to the amount of tax paid within the 3-year 
32 period immediately preceding the filing of a refund  claim or audit.  The provision is 
33 similar to that  provided with respect to income tax refund claims;  and
34 2.  Prohibits the payment of interest on an overpayment of insurance premiums  tax if 
35 the overpayment is refunded by the State Tax Assessor within 60 days of the taxpayer's 
36 filing of the claim with Maine Revenue Services.  The provision is similar  to that 
37 provided with respect  to income  tax refund claims;
Page 11 - 128LR2771(01)-11 Part C:
2 1.  Allows  the subtraction of pick-up contributions distributed to the taxpayer by the 
3 Maine Public Employees Retirement System  in the form  of a rollover  from  taxable 
4 income within 3 years beginning with the year of the rollover.  The change applies to tax 
5 years beginning  on or  after January  1, 2018; and
6 2.  Makes  the credit for homestead modifications available  in the tax year during  
7 which the certification  of eligibility is made.  Current law ties the credit to the year during 
8 which the qualified expenditures are paid, but the credit  may be claimed only once  the 
9 Maine State  Housing  Authority certifies  to the State  Tax Assessor that the expenditures 
10 incurred qualify  for the credit.   The change applies  to tax years  beginning on or after 
11 January 1, 2018;
12 Part D makes the following changes to the tax credit  for major business headquarters  
13 expansions.  It:
14 1.  Clarifies  that the information  regarding  revenue  loss attributable to the tax credit 
15 reported by the State Tax Assessor to the joint standing committee of the Legislature  
16 having jurisdiction over taxation  matters is not confidential  taxpayer  information.  It also 
17 corrects a numbering  conflict created  when 2 public laws enacted the Maine Revised 
18 Statutes, Title 36,  section  191,  subsection 2, paragraph  DDD;
19 2.  Clarifies that a revocation of a certificate of approval or a certificate of completion  
20 due to ceasing operations of the headquarters also applies to a certificate held by a 
21 transferee;
22 3.  Clarifies that the credit is available only to a certified applicant who has received  a 
23 certificate of completion;
24 4.  Clarifies  that the required  job threshold calculation  includes the tax year for which 
25 the credit  is currently  being claimed, in addition to the tax years for which the credit has 
26 been claimed;
27 5.  Clarifies that the amount  recovered by the State  when a certificate is revoked is a 
28 tax due in the taxable  year during which the certificate is revoked and is subject to the 
29 collection and enforcement provisions contained in Title 36, Part 1, including the 
30 application of  applicable interest and penalties;
31 6.  Provides that, when  determining the number of employees for eligibility  for the 
32 credit, employees  who are shifted to a qualified  applicant's headquarters  from  an 
33 affiliated business  in the State are not counted;
34 7.  Removes the requirement that the Commissioner of Economic  and Community 
35 Development report to the joint standing  committee  of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
36 over taxation  matters aggregate  data on employment levels and qualified investment  
37 amounts of  certified applicants  for each year;
Page 12 - 128LR2771(01)-11 8.  Delays the State Tax Assessor's yearly  reporting requirement until December  31st 
2 and clarifies that the report is for the tax year ending  during  the immediately preceding 
3 calendar year;
4 9.  Defines the term "revenue loss" for the purposes of the State Tax Assessor's yearly 
5 reporting requirement and the confidentiality  exception applying to the  report;  and
6 10.  Adds rule -making authority for  the commissioner and the  State Tax Assessor;
7 Part E clarifies that the amount of sales tax revenue  transferred to the Multimodal 
8 Transportation Fund is calculated after a reduction for the amount transferred to the Local 
9 Government Fund  is made;
10 Part F aligns certain  parts  of the Unorganized Territory Educational and Services Tax 
11 lien foreclosure process with the municipal tax lien foreclosure process retroactively to 
12 October 1, 1935.  It:
13 1.  Authorizes the State Tax Assessor to issue a discharge of a tax lien mortgage on 
14 real estate  after the prior owner's right of redemption  has expired,  unless the State has 
15 conveyed any interest based upon  the title acquired from the affected lien;
16 2.  Allows the State Tax Assessor to not perform  certain  inventory  and reporting 
17 procedures with respect to real estate  that is a permanent residence that has been  acquired 
18 by the State through the tax lien  foreclosure process; and
19 3.  Authorizes the State Tax Assessor to convey real estate acquired by the State 
20 through the tax lien foreclosure process to the prior owner without further legislative 
21 authorization if the tax  due on the real  estate has been satisfied; and
22 Part G makes a technical  clarification by repealing the provision  regarding the new 
23 markets capital investment credit  requiring the Commissioner of Administrative and 
24 Financial Services to enter into a memorandum of agreement.  The memorandum  is a 
25 nonbinding document with no substantive legal  effect.
