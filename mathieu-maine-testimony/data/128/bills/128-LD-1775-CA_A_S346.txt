LD 1775 LR 2810(02) 
An Act To Further Delay the Implementation of Certain Provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment A" ( £ -3Y LI) 
Committee: Marijuana Legalization Implementation 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Delay of Implementation of Marijuana Legalization Act 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Delaying the implementation of the provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act (MLA) from Febma1y 1, 2018 to 
April 18, 2018 will have no impact on currently budgeted revenue. Although some one-time funding was provided to 
the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry to prepare for implementation of the MLA, to date the funding for the cost of full and continued 
implementation has not been provided. This delay does not affect the need for additional implementing legislation to 
fund the establislnnent of a regulated marketplace in the State for the adult use of marijuana under the MLA.
