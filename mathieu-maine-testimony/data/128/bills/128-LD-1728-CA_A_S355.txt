128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 627, L.D. 1728, Bill, "An Act To 
Increase the Penalty for Visual Sexual Aggression against a Child" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Amend Maine Criminal Code Sentencing Provisions Relating To 
Increased Sentencing Class Based on Multiple Prior Convictions for Certain Violent 
or Sexual Crimes' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 17-A MRSA §1252, sub-§4-A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 470, §13, is 
further amended to read: 
4-A. If the State pleads and proves that, at the time any crime, excluding murder, 
under chapter 9, 11, lb 13 SF~ 27 or 35, excluding section 853-A; section 402-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph A; or section 752-A or 752-C was committed, or an attempt of 
any such crime was committed, the defendant had 2 or more prior convictions under 
chapter 9, 11, lb 13 SF~ 27 or 35, excluding section 853-A; section 402-A, subsection 1, 
paragraph A; or section 752-A or 752-C, or for an attempt of any such crime, or for 
engaging in substantially similar conduct in another jurisdiction, the sentencing class for 
the crime is one class higher than it would otherwise be. In the case of a Class A crime, 
the sentencing class is not increased, but the prior record must be given serious 
consideration by the court when imposing a sentence. Section 9-A governs the use of 
prior convictions when determining a sentence, except that, for the purposes of this 
subsection, for violations under chapter 11, the dates of prior convictions may have 
occurred at any time. This subsection does not apply to section 210-A if the prior 
convictions have already served to enhance the sentencing class under section 210-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph C or any other offense in which prior convictions have already 
served to enhance the sentencing class.'
