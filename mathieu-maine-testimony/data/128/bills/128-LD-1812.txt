Page 1 - 128LR2893(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the State of Maine has a constitutional obligation to provide indigent legal 
4 services; and
5 Whereas, the diversity in population density and availability of attorneys  across  the 
6 State can present challenges to providing  consistent high-quality legal  services  to fulfill  
7 that obligation; and
8 Whereas, many factors external to the operation of the Maine  Commission  on 
9 Indigent Legal  Services are driving up costs to both prosecution and defense; and
10 Whereas, the need  to ensure the most efficient use of limited resources requires a 
11 study of the existing system  to be conducted by an independent, outside,  nonpartisan  
12 entity; and
13 Whereas, the Working  Group to Improve the Provision of Indigent Legal Services  
14 recommended that such  a study  be conducted as soon as possible; and
15 Whereas, authorization and funding for the study  need to be provided as soon  as 
16 possible for the comprehensive  study to be conducted in time for recommendations to be 
17 considered by the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature;  and
18 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
19 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
20 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
21 therefore, be it
22 Sec. 1.  Legislative Council to contract for independent, nonpartisan,  
23 objective evaluation of obligation  to provide indigent legal services.  
24 Resolved:  That the Legislative Council, through  the Executive Director  of the 
25 Legislative Council, shall contract with a qualified  nonprofit organization that has, within 
26 the 12 months  prior  to the effective date of this resolve, provided consulting and 
27 evaluations regarding state indigent legal services  systems  to evaluate the existing system 
28 in the State for providing legal representation as required  by both the Constitution of 
29 Maine and the United  States  Constitution  and by the laws of the State and to provide  
30 recommendations to improve the structure, services and other elements  of the State's 
31 indigent legal  services system.  The executive director shall arrange for the evaluation to 
32 be completed and a report submitted to the joint standing committee  of the 129th 
33 Legislature having jurisdiction  over judiciary  matters no later than January 15, 2019; and 
34 be it further
35 Sec. 2.  Joint standing  committee authorized  to report out legislation.   
36 Resolved:  That the joint standing committee  of the 129th Legislature having 
37 jurisdiction over judiciary matters  is authorized to submit  legislation based on the report  
38 and recommendations  contained  in the report submitted pursuant  to section 1 to the First 
39 Regular Session  of the 129th Legislature; and be it further
