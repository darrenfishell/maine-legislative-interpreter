The bill directs that 10% of the sales tax on transportation related items be deposited in the Highway Fund and would 
result in a reduction in General Fund revenue of $20,327,557 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a corresponding increase in 
Highway Fund revenue. The bill also directs that 2% of the sales tax on these items be deposited in the Multimodal 
Transportation Fund within the Department of Transportation and would result in a reduction in General Fund 
revenue of $4,065,511 in fiscal year 2018-19 and a corresponding increase in revenue to the Multimodal 
Transportation Fund. The net reduction to the General Fund revenue frim both provisions is $24,393,068. 
The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $20,000 to the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services in fiscal year 2018-19 for programming changes. The bill also includes an Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocation of $4,065,511 to the Department of Transportation in fiscal year 2018-19 in order to spend this new 
revenue.
