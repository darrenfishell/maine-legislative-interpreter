Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost increase -All Funds lf-/_pD) 
The bill requires health insurance contracts executed after January 1, 2019 to provide coverage for marijuana for 
medical use. The State Employee Health Plan (SEHP) will require no additional appropriations or allocations in the 
current biennium. Any costs to the SEHP will begin in fiscal year 2019-20. Currently, marijuana is ille~al nationwide 
and is not approved for medical use by the Federal Drug Administration. Thus, there is not ample research or data 
available to estimate the impact to the state plan in future biennia.
