The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $100,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 to the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services for programming costs to establish a new tax on political expenditures. $0 
$0 
The bill imposes a tax on a person making a political expenditure during a taxable period at the rate of 50% of the 
value of the political expenditure. A taxable period is defined as the interval starting the 14th day before an election or 
referendum and ending the day of the election or referendum. As the amount of revenue collected from this tax could 
vary widely from one election or referendum to another depending on the ballot measures at the time, no estimate of 
revenue is made at this time and no estimate is made regarding the length of time that would pass before the initial 
appropriation of $100,000 will be fully reimbursed to the General Fund. 
This tax on political expenditures could be challenged legally under the First Amendment to the US Constitution's 
provisions regarding free speech. If that happens, and if the court determines that the tax is unconstitutional, the State 
could be required to pay the plaintiff's attorneys fees and court costs. No estimate of the potential cost has been made.
