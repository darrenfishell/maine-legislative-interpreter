2 Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA ยง1355-A, sub-ยง2-B is  enacted to read:
3 2-B.  Grandfathering of certain licenses issued prior to June 1, 2017.  The bureau  
4 may not suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license  issued under this section  or chapter 
5 43 or 45  that was initially issued  prior to June  1, 2017 solely  on the  basis that:
6 A.  The establishment licensed under chapter 43 or 45 was determined  by the bureau  
7 after June 1, 2017 to not be exclusively held or exclusively owned  by a person  
8 licensed to manufacture  liquor under this  section; or
9 B.  The licensee  is in violation of section 707, subsection 2, 3 or 4, if the violation 
10 existed in the same manner  at the time the license was initially issued or at the time 
11 the license was renewed  prior to June  1, 2017.
12 The prohibition described in this subsection  does not apply if the reason for suspension, 
13 revocation or refusal to renew is due to the licensee's substantial misrepresentation of or 
14 failure to disclose material  facts  required for the issuance or renewal of the  license.
15 SUMMARY
16 This bill permanently prohibits the Department of Administrative  and Financial  
17 Services, Bureau  of Alcoholic  Beverages and Lottery Operations  from suspending, 
18 revoking or refusing to renew  certain licenses for the manufacture or sale of liquor issued 
19 prior to June 1, 2017 based  solely on a change  in the bureau's interpretation of the terms 
20 "exclusively held" and "exclusively owned"  or based solely on a conflict with the Maine 
21 Revised Statutes,  Title  28-A, section  707, subsection 2, 3 or  4.
