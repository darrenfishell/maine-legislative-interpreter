JOINT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAY 2017 AS WILLIAMS SYNDROME
 AWARENESS MONTH
             WHEREAS, Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder that remains virtually unknown to the general public, educators and many doctors; and
 
            WHEREAS, Williams syndrome affects one in 10,000 people worldwide,
 including an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States; and
             WHEREAS, Williams syndrome is characterized by medical and developmental
 delays, cardiovascular disease and learning disabilities; and
 
            WHEREAS, despite these problems, people with Williams syndrome often have
 unique abilities, including advanced verbal skills, highly sociable personalities and an affinity for music; and
 
            WHEREAS, children with Williams syndrome need costly ongoing medical care
 and early interventions, such as speech or occupational therapy, that may not be covered
 by insurance or state funding; and
 
            WHEREAS, as adults, most people with Williams syndrome need supportive housing to live to their fullest potential; and
 
            WHEREAS, the Williams Syndrome Association sponsors activities that work to
 increase community awareness and provide financial support for critical research and
 programs, leading to further insights about the disorder and new treatments for the
 future; now, therefore, be it
 
            RESOLVED: That We, the Members of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Legislature now assembled in the First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we
 represent, take this opportunity to recognize May 2017 as Williams Syndrome
 Awareness Month and encourage citizen participation in volunteer activities to increase
 local community awareness of Williams syndrome and its effects.
