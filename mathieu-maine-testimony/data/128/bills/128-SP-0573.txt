persons who have been duly sentenced and committed to the Department of Corrections; and  
Whereas, the current state budget establishes the Downeast Correctional Facility as a 
discrete program by making appropriations  specific to that facility; and

March 20, 2017 to recommend that the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017 include 
funding for the Downeast Correctional Facili ty; and

year beginning July 1, 2017 in order to ensure the safe ty of the public; now, therefore, be it

of the Downeast Correctional F acility for fiscal years 2017 -18 and 2018 -19.
