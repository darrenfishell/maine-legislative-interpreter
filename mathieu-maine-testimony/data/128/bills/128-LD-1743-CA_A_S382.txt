Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Under current law a municipality with a population over 45,000 may have up to 10 liquor stores. This legislation 
allows up to 11 agency liquor stores in a municipality with a population over 60,000. The number of agency liquor 
stores allowed in municipalities with other population ranges remains unchanged from current law. Any additional 
revenue to the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lotte1y Operations as a result of additional liquor licenses is 
expected to be minor.
