This bill creates a public records exception under the Freedom of Access Act to 28

telephone contact with participants and, when telephone contact cannot be made, sends 32 
local law enforcement or other designated first responders to ch eck on the well -being of 33 
the participant at the participant's residence. The bill makes an exception to the 34 
confidentiality provision to allow for the sharing of a participant's personal information, 35 
including health information, with local law enforcement  or other designated first 36 
responders as necessary to administer the program.  37
