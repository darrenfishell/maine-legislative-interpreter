This bill includes appropriations of $100,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 and fiscal year 2018-19 to establish the Lead 
Paint Renovation Certification Fund (LPRCF) within the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The 
LPRCF will provide grants to individuals and businesses to offset'the cost of obtaining certification from the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to comply with the Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule 
under 40 CFR, Part 745, sub part E. 
The bill also includes approp1iations of $59,684 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $80,872 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the DEP 
for one full time Environmental Specialist III position to develop the grant program, administer grant awards and to 
oversee the distribution ofDEP/EPA guidance materials related to the RRP rules to homeowners and persons who 
perform renovations. 
The DEP has indicated that if this bill is enacted it would likely seek delegation authority from the EPA to administer 
and enforce the EPA standards of the RRP program in the state. Contingent upon the extension of delegation 
authority, the DEP has indicated that it would require additional appropriations of $680,419 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 
$918,045 in fiscal year 2018-19 for 6 additional Oil and Hazardous Material Special II positions, 4 additional 
Environmental Special III positions and one additional supervisory Environmental Specialist IV position to implement 
and oversee the state RRP program. Because the bill does not require the DEP to seek such authority this fiscal note 
does not assume funding for these costs.
