This amendment eliminates the General Fund revenue loss created by the bill by reducing the amount of aquaculture 
license fees that will be credited to the Aquaculture Management Fund from $133 to $74.75. The remaining $58.25 
will be credited to General Fund revenue, which is the same split the General Fund has with the Shellfish 
Management Fund for commercial shellfish licenses under current statute. As amended the aquaculture licenses will 
generate $7,475 for the Aquaculture Management Fund and reduce revenue to the Shellfish Management Fund by the 
same amount.
