19 information available to the carrier at the time the request is made and that the

22 subsection does not prohibit a carrier from imposing cost-sharing requirements 
23 disclosed in the enrollee's certificate of coverage for unforeseen health care services 
24 that arise out of the proposed comparable health care service or for a procedure or 
25 service that was not included in the original estimate. This subsection does not

26 provider. A carrier may use the average price paid to a network provider for the covered 
27 comparable health care service under the enrollee's health plan in lieu of the statewide 
28 average price on the Maine Health Data Organization's publicly accessible website as 
29 long as the carrier uses a reasonable method to calculate the average price paid and the

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to S.P. 147, L.D. 445 
1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment requires carriers offering health 
3 plans in the State, beginning Janumy 1, 2019, to establish a small group health plan 
4 design, for all small group health plans compatible with health savings accounts 
5 authorized under federal law, in which enrollees are directly incentivized to shop for 
6 comparable health care services from low-cost, high-quality providers. The amendment 
7 defines "comparable health care service" as a nonemergency, outpatient health care 
8 service in the following 4 categories: physical and occupational therapy services; 
9 radiology and imaging services; laboratory services; and infusion therapy services. The 
10 amendment requires the Superintendent of Insurance to study and evaluate the incentive 
11 programs used by carriers and report annually to the Legislature beginning March 1, 
12 2020. These provisions are repealed on Janumy 1, 2024. 
13 Beginning Janumy 1, 2018, the amendment requires carriers to develop and make 
14 available a website and toll-free telephone number to allow enrollees to obtain 
15 information about estimated costs for obtaining comparable health care services from 
16 network providers. The amendment permits a carrier to direct enrollees to the publicly 
17 accessible health care costs website of the Maine Health Data Organization. 
18 Beginning Janumy 1, 2019, the amendment requires carriers upon request by an 
19 enrollee to apply the amount paid for a comparable health care se1vice provided by an 
20 out-of-network provider toward the enrollee's member cost sharing as specified in the 
21 enrollee's health plan as if the health care se1vices were provided by a network provider, 
22 as long as the cost of the out-of-network service is the same or less than the statewide 
23 average payment for the same se1vice based on data reported on the publicly accessible 
24 health care costs website of the Maine Health Data Organization. A carrier may use the 
25 average network price paid by the can"ier in lieu of the statewide average payment for the 
26 same service based on data reported on the publicly accessible health care costs website 
27 of the Maine Health Data Organization. The amendment defines an out-of-network 
28 provider as a provider located in Maine, Massachusetts or New Hampshire that is 
29 enrolled in the MaineCare program as a provider and that pmiicipates in Medicare. This 
30 provision is repealed Janumy 1, 2024. 
31 The amendment also requires providers to notify patients of their right to obtain 
32 comparable health care se1vices from a different provider at the time a provider makes a 
33 referral or recommendation for a comparable health care service during an in-person visit.

Potential cunent biennium savings -All Funds 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Beginning Januaiy 1, 2019, carriers in the State must offer, on all small group health plans compatible with a health 
savings account, a health plan designed to incentivize shopping for comparable health care services. The State 
Employee Health Plan (SEHP) is not a small group plan and is not required to provide an incentivied plan. However, 
the SEHP could create a plan to provide incentives (i.e. cash payments, gift cards or premium credits) for members 
who shop for and receive a lower cost, but similar quality, health care service. If enough members receive these lower 
cost services, the SEHP could realize savings. The potential savings are dependant on the SEHP setting up an 
incentivied plan and on member behavior modification, which will only happen through education about the program. 
No estimate of potential savings can be made at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation to adopt the changes in this bill are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
