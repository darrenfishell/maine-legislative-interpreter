This amendment adds an emergency preamble and clause, clarifies that the costs of a management audit may be 
allocated to ratepayers or shareholders of an investor-owned utility and requires the Public Utilities Commission 
(PUC) to report back on whether the PUC has exercised its authority to allocate the cost of a management audit to
