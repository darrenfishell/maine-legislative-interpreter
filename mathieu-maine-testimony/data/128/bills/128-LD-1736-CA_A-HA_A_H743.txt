Increased probability of tuition revenue loss -Maine Criminal Justice Academy 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment expands the Maine National Guard Tuition Assistance Program to add the Maine Criminal Justice 
Academy to the list of state postseconda1y education institutions where Maine National Guard members may receive a 
tuition benefit. To the extent that there are sufficient funds available in the Maine National Guard Postsecondaiy Fund 
to pay the tuition costs for all Maine National Guard members who want to paiticipate in the program, there is no 
fiscal impact to the Maine Criminal Justice Academy or the public and private postsecondary education institutions. 
However, if expanding the program results in tuition costs exceeding available funding, there would be an impact to 
the Academy and the public and private postsecondary institutions in the fo11n of lost tuition revenue. Currently, most 
municipal and county law enforcement personnel attending the academy have the cost paid by a municipality or 
county. Under this amendment the savings related to National Guard members in that circumstance would go back to 
the municipalities or counties, but not to the veterans. Whether that would encourage municipalities and counties to 
hire more veterans to reduce training costs cannot be determined.
