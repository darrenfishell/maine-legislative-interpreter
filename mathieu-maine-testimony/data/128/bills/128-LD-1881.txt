2 Sec. 1.  5 MRSA  ยง156 is  enacted to read:
3 ยง156.  Authorization to establish  program
4 The Treasurer  of State is authorized to establish in this State  the ABLE ME Savings  
5 Program, referred to in this section as "the program," to allow  an individual with a 
6 disability to establish a federal  tax-advantaged savings account and use the funds in that 
7 account to pay for the individual's care.  The program must comply with the requirements 
8 of the federal  Achieving  a Better  Life Experience  Act of  2014, Public Law  113-295.
9 The Treasurer of State may adopt routine technical rules pursuant to chapter 375, 
10 subchapter 2-A to implement the provisions  of this section, including all terms and 
11 conditions of  the program.
12 SUMMARY
13 Under the federal  Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, also known as the 
14 ABLE Act of 2014,  individuals  with disabilities  and the families of those  individuals may 
15 establish federal  tax-exempt  savings accounts and use the funds from those  accounts to 
16 pay for the care of the individual with a disability, similar  to so-called 529 accounts  that 
17 allow tax-deferred  savings for college expenses.  Under federal law, a state may establish 
18 ABLE Act  savings accounts only  with the  authorization of  the state.
19 The bill authorizes the Treasurer of State to establish the ABLE ME Savings 
20 Program, in compliance with the ABLE Act of 2014.   The Treasurer of State  is 
21 authorized to adopt routine technical rules to implement the program,  including rules to 
22 establish the terms  and conditions  of the program.
