FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,3,, to H.P. 446, L.D. 630, Bill, "An Act To 
Expand Opportunities for Moose Permit Winners To Swap Their Permits" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Allow the Transfer of Moose Permits for Consideration' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §11110, sub-§1, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 301, §14, is 
amended to read: 
1. Transfer permitted. A person who has been assigned a designated hunting area, 
zone or season by the department for purposes of hunting a game animal may exchange 
that designated zone, area or season with another person assigned a different hunting 
zone, area or season for the same game animal for purposes of hunting that same game 
animal. The department may assist in the transfer to ensure that the permit holders meet 
the requirements of section 107 5 6, but the State bears no responsibility for enforcing the 
terms of the exchange between the permit holders. The commissioner may adopt rules to 
implement this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules 
as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
Sec. 2. 12 MRSA §11110, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 301, §14, is 
repealed.'

amendment does not direct the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish

Inland Fisheries and Wildlife may assist in the transfer of a permit to hunt in any assigned
