8 SUMMARY
9 This bill is a recommendation  of the Working Group to Improve  the Provision of 
10 Indigent Legal  Services.  It amends the makeup of the Maine Commission on Indigent 
11 Legal Services, based on suggestions of the Sixth Amendment  Center, to include 
12 appointments suggested by the Dean of the University of Maine  School of Law and the 
13 president of a statewide organization representing attorneys.  It also increases the number 
14 of appointments  from a list suggested by the Chief Justice  of the Supreme  Judicial Court 
15 from one to 2.  The number of  members required for a quorum is adjusted from  3 to 5.
16 In order to ensure the independence of the commission and ensure no appearance of 
17 conflict of interest, the bill prohibits the appointment to the commission of a person who 
18 is a sitting judge, prosecutor, law enforcement official  or indigent  legal services provider,  
19 or an employee of such  a person.
