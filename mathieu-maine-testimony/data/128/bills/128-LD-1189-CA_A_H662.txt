128TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·fl-" to H.P. 826, L.D. 1189, Bill, "An Act To 
Define the Age of Consent for Alcohol or Drug Treatment and Mental Health Services" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in § 1502 in the first paragraph in the 3rd line (page 1, line 
7 in L.D.) by striking out the following: 111411 and inserting the following: 1121 
Amend the bill in section 1 in §1502 in the first paragraph by striking out all of the 
last 2 sentences (page 1, lines 9 to 12 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 'If a minor 12 
years of age or older consents to such treatment, a parent or guardian may not abrogate 
that consent.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, changes from 14 
years of age to 12 years of age the age of a minor who may consent to treatment for abuse 
of alcohol or drugs or for emotional or psychological problems. It removes the provision 
that prevents a minor from abrogating the consent of the minor's parent or guardian. The 
bill provides that a parent or guardian may not abrogate the consent to treatment provided 
by a minor 14 years of age or older; the amendment changes that age to 12 years of age or 
older.
