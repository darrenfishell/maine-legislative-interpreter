15 SUMMARY
16 This bill is reported out by the Joint  Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and 
17 Wildlife pursuant to Joint Order 2017, H.P. 1250.  The bill removes the provision of law 
18 that makes a permit issued by the Department of Inland  Fisheries and Wildlife to use a 
19 noise suppression device  with a firearm when  hunting valid only until August 1, 2018.  
20 The bill also removes  the provision of law that prohibits the Commissioner of Inland 
21 Fisheries and Wildlife  from  issuing a permit allowing  a person to use a noise suppression 
22 device with a firearm when  hunting after  July 31, 2018.
23 The committee has not taken a position on the substance of this bill.  By reporting  
24 this bill out, the committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees 
25 or disagrees with any aspect  of this bill.  The committee  is reporting the bill out for the 
26 sole purpose of having a bill printed that can be referred to the committee for an 
27 appropriate public hearing and subsequent  processing  in the normal  course.  The 
28 committee is taking this action to ensure clarity  and transparency  in the legislative review  
29 of the proposals contained  in the bill.
