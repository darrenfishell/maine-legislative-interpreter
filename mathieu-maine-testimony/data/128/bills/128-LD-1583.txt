SUMMARY  15 
The purpose of this bill is to amend and update technical terminology, remove 16 
outdated provisions and ambiguity in the licensing provisions of the Maine Revised 17 
Statutes, Title 32, chapter 17 and reorganize existing provisions for clarity. The bill adds 18 
a definition of "dwelling unit" and amends the definition of "electrical installation" to 19 
include updated terminology.  The bill clarifies qualifications for specific license types, 20 
adds a description of the scope of authority of license type and  clarifies supervisory 21 
requirements of licensees.  22 
The bill moves provisions of law governing supervision responsibilities of certain 23 
license types to a new section of law.  The bill clarifies existing provisions applicable to 24 
electrical permits for nonresi dential electrical wiring by enacting separate provisions that 25 
apply to wiring work in single -family dwellings.  The bill moves provisions applicable to 26 
state electrical inspectors to a more appropriate section.  27 
The bill clarifies the composition of the El ectricians' Examining Board and reduces 28 
the required years of licensed experience in the electrical field prior to board appointment 29 
from 10 years to 5 years.  It amends the board's authority to license applicants licensed in 30 
other states that do not requi re electrical education if the applicants can document 31 
comparable work experience in substitution of electrical education.  32 
The bill amends the reciprocity laws to reduce the minimum number of work hours 33 
that a journeyman electrician licensed in a reciproc al state must show to obtain a 34 
journeyman electrician or master electrician license in Maine in order to allow a 35 
journeyman licensed as such in a reciprocating state to be credited for those hours of 36 
work experience.  37
