Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $51,666 in fiscal year 2017-18 to the General Purpose 
Aid for Local Schools program within the Department of Education for the cost of making necessary changes to its 
essential programs and services system in order to implement the requirements of this legislation. 
This bill requires the Department of Education to deposit 90% of the state subsidy for each child approved for an 
education savings account that would othe1wise be paid to the child's local school administrative unit (SAU) into a 
savings account established for that child. This bill also requires the SAU of the child approved for the education 
savings account to deposit 90% of its required local contribution attributable to that child into the child's education 
savings account. The impact to individual SAU's affected by this requirement will depend on the number of students 
in each SAU that participate in the program each year. 
The bill also includes General Fund appropriations of $56, 159 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $57, 73 5 in fiscal year 2018-
