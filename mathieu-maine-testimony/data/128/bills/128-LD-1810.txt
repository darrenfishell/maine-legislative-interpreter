Page 1 - 128LR2820(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the laws governing expedited permitting  for wind energy development do 
4 not adequately restrict wind energy development from areas where  it is inappropriate; and
5 Whereas, the Legislature  anticipates an increase in the number of wind energy 
6 development proposals in the future; and
7 Whereas, the changes made  by this legislation need to take effect as soon  as 
8 possible to avoid  allowing  development to proceed in areas  where its impacts would be 
9 untenably harmful; and
10 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
13 therefore,
14 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
15 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub-§3,  as amended by PL 2015, c. 265, §3 and 
16 affected by §10,  is further amended to read:
17 3.  Expedited permitting area.  "Expedited permitting area" means:
18 A.  The organized areas of the State  in their entirety, but not including waters subject 
19 to tidal influence,  so that the edge of the area that is subject  to tidal action  during  the 
20 highest tide level for the year in which an activity is proposed as identified in tide 
21 tables published by the United States  Department of Commerce, National  Oceanic 
22 and Atmospheric  Administration,  National Ocean Service defines  the boundary of the 
23 expedited permitting area on lands abutting  waters subject to tidal influence portion  
24 of Aroostook County that includes the Town  of St. Francis, St. John Plantation, the 
25 Town of Fort Kent, the Town of Wallagrass, the Town of Eagle Lake, Winterville 
26 Plantation, T14 R6 W.E.L.S., the Town of Portage Lake,  Nashville Plantation,  
27 Garfield Plantation, T10 R6 W.E.L.S., Oxbow Plantation, the portion of Aroostook 
28 County east of those municipalities and also all municipalities in Aroostook County 
29 that are wholly located south of the northernmost extent  of Penobscot County, 
30 excluding Cary Plantation and Molunkus Township; and
31 B.  Specified  places within the unorganized and deorganized areas that are identified 
32 by rule by the Maine Land Use Planning Commission in accordance with this 
33 chapter.
34 Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub-§10-B, as reallocated by RR 2015, c. 1, §39, is 
35 amended to read:
36 10-B.  Viewshed of a scenic  resource of state or national significance.  "Viewshed 
37 of a scenic resource  of state or national significance" means  the geographic area as 
38 viewed from a scenic resource of state or national significance that includes  the proposed 
Page 2 - 128LR2820(01)-11 wind energy development.   The viewshed of a scenic resource of state or national 
2 significance may include the proposed wind energy  development visible from  a single  
3 viewer position or the proposed wind energy  development visible from  multiple viewer 
4 positions.  The viewshed  of a scenic resource of state or national significance is limited  to 
5 the geographic area within 8 40 miles, measured horizontally, from the proposed wind 
6 energy development's generating facilities.
7 Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2015, c. 190, §4, is 
8 further amended  to read:
9 3.  Evaluation  criteria.  In making its determination pursuant to subsection 1, and in 
10 determining whether  an applicant for an expedited wind energy development must 
11 provide a visual  impact  assessment in accordance with subsection 4, the primary  siting 
12 authority shall consider:
13 A.  The significance of the potentially affected scenic resource of state or national  
14 significance;
15 B.  The existing  character of  the surrounding area;
16 C.  The expectations of the typical viewer;
17 D.  The expedited wind energy development's purpose and the context  of the 
18 proposed activity;
19 E.  The extent, nature and duration of potentially affected public uses of the scenic 
20 resource of state or national significance and the potential effect of the generating 
21 facilities' presence on the public's continued  use and enjoyment of the scenic resource 
22 of state or national significance; and
23 F.  The scope  and scale  of the potential effect  of views of the generating facilities  on 
24 the scenic  resource of state or national significance, including but not limited  to 
25 issues related to the number and extent of turbines visible from the scenic resource of 
26 state or national  significance,  the distance from the scenic resource of state or 
27 national significance and the effect of prominent features of the development on the 
28 landscape.
29 In applying these criteria, the primary siting authority shall consider  the primary  impact 
30 and the cumulative scenic impact or effect of the development during both day and night 
31 on scenic resources of state or national significance.  In evaluating cumulative scenic 
32 impact or effect  associated  with sequential observation, the department shall  consider,  in 
33 addition to the criteria in this subsection,  the distance between viewpoints on the linear 
34 route and other forms of development  along  the linear  route that effect  the expectation of 
35 the user of the scenic resource of state or national significance.  A finding by the primary 
36 siting authority that the development's generating facilities are a highly visible feature  in 
37 the landscape  is not a solely sufficient basis for determination  that an expedited wind 
38 energy project  has an unreasonable adverse  effect on the scenic character  and existing 
39 uses related to scenic character of a scenic resource of state or national significance.  In 
40 making its determination under  subsection 1, the primary siting authority  shall consider  
41 insignificant the effects of portions  of the development's generating facilities located 
Page 3 - 128LR2820(01)-11 more than 8 40 miles, measured horizontally,  from a scenic resource of state or national 
2 significance.
3 Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub-§4,  as enacted  by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 
4 amended to read:
5 4.  Visual impact assessment; rebuttable presumption.  An applicant for an 
6 expedited wind energy development shall  provide the primary siting authority  with a 
7 visual impact assessment  of the development that addresses the evaluation criteria in 
8 subsection 3 if the primary siting authority determines such an assessment is necessary in 
9 accordance with subsection 3.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a visual impact 
10 assessment is not required  for those  portions of the development's  generating facilities  
11 that are located more than 3 miles, measured horizontally, from a scenic  resource of state 
12 or national significance.  The primary siting authority may require a visual impact  
13 assessment for portions of the development's generating  facilities located more than 3 
14 miles and up to 8 40 miles from a scenic resource  of state or national significance if it 
15 finds there is substantial  evidence that a visual  impact  assessment is needed to determine 
16 if there  is the potential  for significant adverse effects on the scenic resource of state or 
17 national significance.   Information intended to rebut the presumption must be submitted 
18 to the primary siting  authority by any interested person within  30 days of acceptance of 
19 the application as complete for processing. The primary siting  authority shall determine if 
20 the presumption is rebutted based on a preponderance of evidence in the  record.
21 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
22 legislation takes effect when  approved.
23 SUMMARY
24 This bill amends the laws governing expedited permitting for wind energy 
25 development by changing the definition of "expedited permitting area" to mean  specified 
26 places that are identified by rule and the eastern portion of Aroostook County, 
27 specifically described as the Town of St. Francis,  St. John  Plantation, the Town of Fort 
28 Kent, the Town of Wallagrass, the Town  of Eagle  Lake, Winterville Plantation, T14 R6 
29 W.E.L.S., the Town of Portage Lake, Nashville  Plantation,  Garfield Plantation, T10 R6 
30 W.E.L.S., Oxbow  Plantation, the portion of Aroostook County east of those  
31 municipalities and also all municipalities in Aroostook County that are wholly located 
32 south of the northernmost extent  of Penobscot  County, excluding Cary  Plantation and 
33 Molunkus Township.
34 The bill changes  from 8 miles  to 40 miles the farthest distance  from a proposed  
35 expedited wind energy development for which a visual impact assessment  for potentially 
36 affected scenic  resources of state or national  significance may be required.
