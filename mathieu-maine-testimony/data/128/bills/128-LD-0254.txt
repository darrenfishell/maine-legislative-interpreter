 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the statutory provisions of the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act took 3 
effect on June 1, 2 014 without the corresponding regulatory framework in place as 4 
directed under Public Law 2011, chapter 653; and  5 
Whereas, without the corresponding regulatory framework in place, the State is at 6 
risk for litigation based on inconsistencies between the curre nt statutory and regulatory 7 
frameworks for metallic mineral mining; and  8 
Whereas, implementation of a moratorium on the issuance of a mining permit under 9 
the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act provides the State with the time necessary to 10 
address these incon sistencies; and  11 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 12 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 13 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and  safety; now, 14 
therefore,  15 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  16
