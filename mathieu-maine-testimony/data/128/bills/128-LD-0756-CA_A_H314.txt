Sec. 2. Existing affiliate. Prior to the adoption of rules by the Public Utilities 
Commission as required by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3204, 
subsection 11, an affiliate, as defined in section 3204, subsection 11, of an investor­

transmission and distribution utility to own generation or generation-related assets in 
accordance with standards of conduct adopted by the Public Utilities Commission, unless 
the generation or generation-related assets are directly interconnected to the facilities 
owned or operated by that investor-owned transmission and distribution utility. It directs 
the Public Utilities Commission to adopt major substantive rules that establish standards 
of conduct governing the relationship between an investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utility and an affiliate that ensure the separation and independence of the 
affiliate and protects ratepayers. 
The amendment allows an affiliate of an investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utility that owns generation or generation-related assets that are not directly 
interconnected to the facilities owned or operated by that investor-owned transmission or 
distribution utility to continue to own those generation or generation-related assets. Upon 
adoption of rules by the Public Utilities Commission, the affiliate is subject to the 
standards of conduct adopted by the commission.
