Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Increasing the maximum period of time that educators may participate in an interchange program with the Department 
of Education extends the length of time that the State may be held responsible if an educator participating in the 
program experiences a personal injury that results in a disability or death. The impact to the State's Workers' 
Compensation Management Fund will depend on actual experience.
