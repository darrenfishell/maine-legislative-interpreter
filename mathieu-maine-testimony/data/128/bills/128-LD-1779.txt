Page 1 - 128LR2719(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Maine Turnpike Authority  is planning to build a new toll facility in 
4 the Town  of York at a cost of $41,000,000 to replace  the existing toll facility at the 
5 southern gateway to and from Maine  without fully  implementing an all-electronic tolling 
6 system; and
7 Whereas, the design of such a toll facility  would soon be obsolete due to the rapid  
8 advances in electronic  tolling methods; and
9 Whereas, the estimated  cost for construction of a simple overhead  gantry that 
10 incorporates all-electronic toll collection is much less at $5,000,000, and an all-electronic 
11 toll facility will be safer  to drive through  and be far less expensive to operate over the life 
12 of the currently proposed  toll facility;  and
13 Whereas, this legislation  requires newly constructed  and reconstructed toll facilities 
14 to use an  all-electronic  tolling system; and
15 Whereas, due to the imminent nature of the Maine Turnpike  Authority's proposed 
16 reconstruction of arguably the busiest toll facility in the State, this requirement needs to 
17 take effect prior  to the expiration  of the 90-day period; and
18 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
19 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
20 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
21 therefore,
22 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
23 Sec. 1.  23 MRSA  ยง1966, sub-ยง6 is enacted to read:
24 6.  Reconstruction or construction of toll facility.  Notwithstanding any provision 
25 of section 1973, subsection  3 to the contrary, when the authority reconstructs an existing 
26 turnpike toll facility  or constructs a new turnpike toll facility, the authority shall install 
27 and implement  only an electronic toll collection  system for that reconstructed or new toll 
28 facility.  For purposes  of this subsection, "electronic toll collection system" means a 
29 system of  collecting tolls or other  charges by electronic  means.
30 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
31 legislation takes effect when  approved.
32 SUMMARY
33 This bill requires the Maine Turnpike Authority  to install  and implement only an 
34 electronic toll collection system, also known as an all-electronic tolling system, for any 
35 reconstructed or newly  constructed toll facility  on the turnpike.
