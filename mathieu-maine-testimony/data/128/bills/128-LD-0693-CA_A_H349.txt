the person's control on a motor vehicle other than an A TV or snowmobile as long as the 
motor vehicle is not moving and its engine is off. The amendment prohibits a person from 
shooting while in an enclosed area or passenger compartment of an ATV or snowmobile, 
but allows a person to shoot a firearm or crossbow from or rest a loaded firearm or 
crossbow on the ATV or snowmobile when the ATV or snowmobile is not in motion and 
its engine is off. The amendment also provides that a person who is target shooting and 
not within an enclosed area or passenger compartment of a motor vehicle, trailer or other 
vehicle being hauled by a motor vehicle may shoot a firearm or crossbow when the motor 
vehicle, trailer or other type of vehicle is not in motion and the engine is not running.
