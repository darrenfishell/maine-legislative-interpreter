This amendment restores the requirement that was eliminated in the committee amendment that a person pay a $7 fee 
when that person applies for and is issued a permit electronically using the system developed by the State to issue 
bum permits. The revenue loss is reversed and the appropriation to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry to pay InforME for certain online costs is no longer needed and is removed.
