12 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A" to H.P. 276, L.D. 370 
D. A buffer zone established pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph (6) may not 
exceed 5 feet between any 2 nets and may not exceed 20 feet beyond the outermost 
perimeter of a net or multiple nets when those nets are placed within 5 feet of each 
other.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which allows municipalities to designate 
conservation areas where harvesting any marine organism is prohibited. The amendment 
instead provides that a municipal shellfish ordinance may prohibit harvesting any marine 
organism in a buffer zone around netting placed for protection from shellfish predators, as 
long as the buffer zone does not exceed 5 feet between any 2 nets and 20 feet around the 
outermost perimeter of a net or multiple nets when those nets are placed within 5 feet of 
each other.
