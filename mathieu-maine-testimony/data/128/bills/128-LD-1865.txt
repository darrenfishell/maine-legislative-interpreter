9 is a conflict of interest for a notary public to administer  an oath or affirmation to a 
10 circulator of a petition  for a direct initiative  or people's veto referendum under  Title 21-A, 
11 section 902 if the notary  public also provides  services that are not notarial  acts to initiate

13 or apply  to notarial  acts performed  before August 4, 1988.

32 circulate the petition,  the Secretary of State shall  include the following statement, in a 
33 bold type in a type size of no less than 16 points,  below  the space that contains the 
34 circulator's name:
35 "This circulator  is being paid to solicit signatures for  this direct initiative."
36 A circulator who is compensated or paid to circulate  petitions may not collect signatures  
37 on a petition that does not include the statement  described in this subsection.

3 signatures for the petition by presenting the petition  to the voter, asking the voter to sign 
4 the petition and personally witnessing the voter affixing  the voter's signature  to the 
5 petition.  The circulator  of the petition must comply with the provisions of section  901-A, 
6 subsection 3 and section 902.

25 for the purpose of initiating or influencing  a campaign for a people's veto referendum  
26 under the Constitution of Maine,  Article IV, Part Third, Section 17 or a direct initiative of 
27 legislation under the  Constitution of Maine, Article IV,  Part Third, Section 18.
28 1.  Definitions.   As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the

32 (1)  Funds or anything of value  that the contributor specified were given  in 
33 connection with a campaign for a people's veto referendum or direct initiative 
34 campaign;
35 (2)  Funds or anything of value provided in response to a solicitation that would

Page 3 - 128LR2910(01)-11 (3)  Funds or anything of value that can be reasonably determined to have  been

3 veto referendum or direct initiative campaign  when  viewed in the context of the 
4 contribution and the recipient committee's activities  during the campaign.
5 B.  "Major contributor" means a person, other  than an individual, that makes  one or 
6 more contributions aggregating in excess  of $100,000 within a calendar  year to a 
7 ballot question committee or political action committee  for the purpose  of initiating 
8 or influencing  a people's veto referendum or direct initiative campaign.
9 2.  Notice  to major contributor.  Within 5 days of receiving more than $100,000 in 
10 the aggregate within a calendar year from a major contributor, the recipient committee  
11 shall provide written  notice to the major contributor of the reporting  requirement under 
12 this section and shall  submit a copy of the notice to the commission.  If the $100,000 
13 aggregate amount  is exceeded as a result of a contribution received during the last 13 
14 days before an election,  the recipient  committee shall,  within 24 hours of receiving the 
15 contribution, provide written  notice of the reporting requirement to the major  contributor 
16 and submit  a copy of the notice to the commission.  The commission  shall prepare a 
17 sample written notice for this  purpose.
18 3.  Required reports.  A major contributor shall file a report  containing  the 
19 information required  in subsection 4 on or before the filing deadline under  section 1059, 
20 subsection 2 for the recipient committee's October  quarterly  or 11-day  preelection  
21 campaign finance  report, whichever occurs first after the major contributor receives  
22 notice of the reporting requirement.  If a major contributor  has received a notice from  a 
23 recipient committee or the commission during the last 13 days before an election as 
24 required under subsection  2, the major  contributor shall  file a report within 2 business 
25 days of receiving notice from the recipient committee  or commission.  The commission 
26 shall prescribe and prepare forms for these reports and may require major contributors to 
27 file reports  electronically.
28 4.  Content.  In the reports  required under subsection 3, a major  contributor shall 
29 provide:
30 A.  The name of and relevant contact information for the major contributor  and the 
31 name of a responsible officer of the major contributor;
32 B.  The form of organization and purpose of the major  contributor;
33 C.  The amount and date of each contribution from the major  contributor to the 
34 recipient committee during the calendar  year;
35 D.  A certification  that the major contributor has not received contributions, in whole 
36 or in part, for the purpose of initiating or influencing a people's veto referendum  or 
37 direct initiative campaign  in this State or, if the major  contributor has received such 
38 contributions, the dates,  sources and amounts of any such  contributions;
39 E.  Information concerning the 5 largest sources of funds received  by the major  
40 contributor during the 12 months prior to the filing of the report, including but not 
41 limited to identifying the sources and amounts  of the funds and the dates the funds 
42 were received; and
Page 4 - 128LR2910(01)-11 F.  A statement indicating whether the major  contributor is exempt from taxation

3 governmental jurisdictions within the United  States  in which the major  contributor  
4 has filed campaign finance reports during  the previous 12 months.
5 The commission may require by rule additional information to be reported consistent with 
6 this subsection to facilitate disclosure  to citizens of this State of financial  activity  
7 conducted for the purpose  of influencing elections in this State. The commission may by 
8 rule permit  major contributors to exclude the sources of funds that are restricted to 
9 purposes unrelated to a  people's veto referendum  or a direct initiative campaign.
10 5.  Noncompliance.  The commission may assess a civil penalty against a major  
11 contributor that does not file a timely  report required under  this section. The preliminary 
12 penalty is 10% of the total contributions required to be reported, up to a maximum  of 
13 $50,000. Within 14 calendar  days of receiving  notice of the preliminary penalty from  the 
14 commission, the major contributor may request that the penalty  be waived  in full or in 
15 part. In considering a request for a waiver, the commission  shall consider,  among other 
16 things, any lack of notice to the major contributor  of the reporting  requirement, the 
17 number of days that the report  was filed late and the amount of the contributions required 
18 to be reported.   A major contributor  requesting a determination  may either appear in 
19 person or designate a representative to appear on the major  contributor's  behalf or submit 
20 a sworn  statement explaining the mitigating  circumstances for consideration by the 
21 commission.  After a commission meeting, notice  of the final determination of the 
22 commission and the penalty, if any, imposed  pursuant to this subsection must be sent to 
23 the major  contributor. If a determination is not requested, the preliminary penalty 
24 calculated by the commission is final. The commission shall mail final notice of the 
25 penalty to the major  contributor.  A final determination  by the commission may be 
26 appealed to the Superior  Court  in accordance with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 7 and 
27 the Maine Rules  of Civil Procedure, Rule 80C.  The commission  may assess a civil 
28 penalty in the same amount against a recipient  committee that has not provided written  
29 notice of the reporting requirements to the major  contributor as required by subsection 2, 
30 using the same procedures  as set out in this subsection  for penalties against the major 
31 contributor.
32 SUMMARY
33 This bill changes the requirements  regarding the statements the Secretary of State 
34 must include  on petitions used for the collection of signatures  for a direct initiative.  If the 
35 circulator of a petition is being paid to circulate the petition,  that petition must include,  on 
36 each page intended  for voter  signatures, a statement  under the circulator's name that the 
37 circulator is being paid.    The bill also states  that a notary  public or other  person  generally 
38 authorized to administer oaths or affirmations  is not considered authorized to administer 
39 oaths or affirmations to a petition circulator if the notary public or person  is also 
40 providing services to initiate that petition or promote the measure  for which the petition is 
41 being circulated.   It also provides that a notary public  has a conflict of interest  if the 
42 notary public provides  services, other than notarial acts, to a campaign for a direct 
43 initiative or people's veto referendum and also administers an oath to a circulator who is 
44 collecting signatures for that same  direct initiative or people's veto referendum.  The bill 
Page 5 - 128LR2910(01)-11 requires financial reports from major contributors to a direct initiative or people's veto 
2 referendum campaign.   A major contributor is an entity, other than an individual, that 
3 makes contributions aggregating more  than $100,000 in a calendar  year to a ballot 
4 committee or political action committee  for the purpose of initiating  or influencing a 
5 direct initiative or people's veto referendum.  The report  must disclose  the name and 
6 purpose of the organization making  the contribution,  the amount and date of each 
7 contribution, the 5 largest sources of income in the year prior to filing the report, whether 
8 the organization  has received contributions for the purposes  of influencing a direct 
9 initiative or people's veto referendum, if the organization  is a tax-exempt organization 
10 and if the organization  has filed campaign finance reports in other  jurisdictions in the past 
11 12 months.
