6 services. When curtailing services,  the board may provide varying levels of service to 
7 eligible persons depending  on an assessment of their needs. The board may allocate an 
8 amount of funding for each assessment  level and restrict the total amount of services  
9 provided to eligible persons  in that assessment level to the funding amount allocated to 
10 that level. The assessment  levels must  be based on the extent of interference with 
11 activities of daily living,  functional abilities and need for health and social services of the 
12 eligible persons.

28 ramp-up period as described  in section  7286 ending no later than December 31, 2021 
29 during which services are made available to eligible  persons to the greatest extent 
30 possible without curtailing enrollment;
31 F.  Shall set reimbursement rates for services eligible for reimbursement under the 
32 program in a manner that maximizes  access to those services, supports workforce

35 may not restrict eligibility for the program as  set forth in section 7286;

Page 5 - 128LR2964(01)-11 J.  Shall, in the event the board identifies disparities in access to relevant  services by 
2 race, income  or gender, manage the program  so that those disparities  are reduced  or 
3 eliminated;
4 K.  Shall create a process for assessing the needs for in-home  and community support 
5 services for individuals who need those services who are residing in their own homes 
6 or in other private homes in the community and a process for determining the extent  
7 of services  eligible persons may receive;
8 L.  May partner  with the department to provide supplementary  funding to existing 
9 state programs,  including long-term care programs other than in-home and 
10 community support  services, to expand eligibility, increase payments  to providers  or 
11 raise quality standards consistent with other  responsibilities, and to maintain  a stable,  
12 high-quality care workforce;
13 M.  Shall create and adopt  its own governance rules and develop and approve  its own 
14 budget for the program and its administration and may expend no more  than 5% of

20 and promote awareness  of application  procedures;

15 funding received from  the Universal Home Care Program on direct service worker costs.  
16 When determining compliance, the board shall calculate this percentage on a statewide, 
17 annual basis for each provider.  A provider that fails to meet  this direct service worker 
18 payment minimum may be suspended from the program or required to make  additional  
19 payments to the respective direct service workers, or both; any additional  payments  must  
20 be for the year in which the provider failed to meet the minimum set forth in this section 
21 and must  be sufficient  to bring the provider into compliance.
22 2.  Report.  In order to prove compliance with subsection 1, a provider shall  submit 
23 an annual cost report to the board based upon actual,  documented expenditures for direct 
24 service worker  costs, administrative costs and  other costs of program  support.
25 A.  The cost report must demonstrate that the provider has expended a minimum of 
26 77% of the funding received from the program for direct service  worker costs.  The 
27 remaining funding received from the program may be spent by the provider on 
28 administrative or program support costs.
29 B.  An authorized representative of the provider shall attest to the accuracy  of the cost 
30 report.
31 C.  The board may require the provider to engage an independent certified public 
32 accounting firm to verify the information and data submitted by the provider under 
33 this subsection if the board is in possession of evidence  to suggest the information 
34 and data submitted is inaccurate, incomplete  or fraudulent.  The provider is 
35 responsible for the cost of this audit.
36 D.  For a provider who does not submit a complete, accurate and timely report under 
37 this subsection, the board may impose a corrective action plan to reimburse service 
38 workers, temporarily  suspend the provider from covering additional persons in the 
39 program or permanently terminate the provider from the program, in addition to other 
40 remedies that  may be  available.
Page 9 - 128LR2964(01)-11 3.  Rules.  The board may adopt  rules to implement this section.  Rules adopted 
2 pursuant to this section  are routine technical rules  as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
3 subchapter 2-A.  Rules adopted by the board pursuant to this section  may include

14 with the names  and most recent contact information of the other constituents of the 
15 particular constituency eligible to vote in the next board election for the purpose of 
16 inviting those  individuals to join their constituency  association.  The board shall provide

18 maintain the confidentiality of the list and may not share the list with the public  or any 
19 other entity not authorized by the board.
20 3.  Dues.  If an employee  of a provider of in-home  and community support services 
21 chooses to join a constituency association, the provider must deduct and remit 
22 membership dues to the association if  requested  by the employee.
