SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and instead establishes the Maine Buy America and 
Build Maine Pilot Project. Under the pilot project, public agencies are authorized, but not 
required, to issue contracts that contain a provision that requires any manufactured goods, 
including iron and steel, used or supplied in the performance of the contract or any 
subcontract to the contract to be manufactured in the United States when that contract is 
for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of a 
public building or public work made by a state agency, board, commission or institution. 
The pilot project also authorizes a state agency, in the award of a bid for the 
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of a public 
building or public work or for services to be provided to or on behalf of the State, if 2 or 
more bids are submitted that are substantially similar, to give preference to the bid 
submitted by an in-state contractor. If the bid submitted by an in-state contractor is 
higher than the lowest bid submitted by a contractor that is not an in-state contractor, the 
state agency is authorized to give the in-state contractor the opportunity to match the 
lowest bid submitted. 
The pilot project is repealed after 2 years.

The provision in this amendment that makes permissive, but does not require, public agencies to issue contracts that 
contain a provision that requires any manufactured goods be manufactured in the United States will eliminate the 
potential current biennium cost increase to the State's higher educational institutions, the Department of 
Transportation and other state agencies. The administrative costs to the Department of Administration and Financial
