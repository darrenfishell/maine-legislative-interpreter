2 Sec. 1.  21-A MRSA §671, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2005, c. 453, §55, is 
3 further amended  to read:
4 1.  Name announced; proof of identity.  A voter  person who wishes to vote must 
5 state the voter's name and present proof  of identity in the form of a photographic 
6 identification document and, upon request, state the voter's residence  address  to an 
7 election clerk , who shall announce the name in a loud,  clear voice.   Photographic  
8 identification required by this subsection  must be an official identification document or 
9 card issued by a state,  the Federal Government or a college or university located in the 
10 State, or an electronic benefits transfer card under Title 22, chapter 1, subchapter  1-A that 
11 displays an identifying photograph,  and may not be expired.  An election worker may use 
12 the photographic identification required  by this subsection solely for the purpose of 
13 verifying the identity of the person who wishes to vote.  If a person  who wishes  to vote 
14 does not present  photographic identification,  that person must be permitted to cast a 
15 provisional ballot as provided by section 671-A.  Before November 9, 2018, the identity  
16 of a person who does not present photographic  proof  of identity but is known to an 
17 election worker, as defined  in subsection  1-A, at the voting place may be verified  as 
18 provided in subsection 1-A.
19 Sec. 2.  21-A MRSA §671, sub-§1-A is  enacted to read:
20 1-A.  Voter known to election  worker; verification of identity.   A person  who does 
21 not provide  photographic identification on election  day as required by subsection 1 and is 
22 known to an election worker  at the voting place may be issued  a ballot after completion  
23 and signing  of an affidavit by the election worker.  The affidavit must be in a form 
24 prescribed by the Secretary of State  and must be written to indicate that the election 
25 worker can personally  attest  to the identity of the voter.   The election worker  may issue 
26 the voter a ballot after the election worker who can attest  to the identity of the voter  has 
27 signed the affidavit. For the purposes of this subsection, "election worker" includes a 
28 municipal clerk, registrar  and election official.
29 This subsection is repealed November 9, 2018.
30 Sec. 3.  21-A MRSA §671-A is enacted  to read:
31 §671-A.  Provisional  voting
32 A person who has not provided photographic  identification as required by section  
33 671, subsection  1 and has not had the person's identity  verified by affidavit as provided  in 
34 section 671, subsection 1-A must  be permitted to cast  a provisional ballot as follows.
35 1.  Provisional ballot affidavit.   In order to cast a provisional ballot under  this 
36 section, a person  must  complete  and sign a provisional ballot affidavit, swearing to or 
37 affirming that that person  is the person that person claims  to be on the incoming voting 
38 list. The provisional ballot affidavit must  be on a form designed  by the Secretary of State 
39 and must  include, at a minimum, the person's  name, address,  party affiliation, if any, and 
40 reason that  the person  was not able to provide  photographic proof  of identity.
Page 2 - 128LR2926(01)-11 2.  Provisional ballot and provisional ballot envelope  issued.   As soon  as the 
2 provisional ballot affidavit  form under subsection 1 has been completed, the election 
3 clerk in charge of ballots shall give a provisional ballot and a provisional ballot envelope 
4 to the warden. The warden shall  write  a provisional  ballot number  on the affidavit form  
5 and the provisional  ballot envelope and give the ballot and envelope to the voter. The 
6 warden also shall give the voter a notice about provisional voting, on a form designed  by 
7 the Secretary of State, that includes  the provisional ballot number assigned to the voter's  
8 ballot.  The form  must clearly  state that the person who wishes to vote has 3 business 
9 days to provide  the municipal clerk, deputy clerk,  warden or election clerk photographic 
10 proof of identity as prescribed in section  671, subsection 1 in order for the provisional 
11 ballot to  be counted.
12 3.  Proceed to vote.  After a voter marks  the provisional ballot under  subsection 2, 
13 the voter  shall  seal it in the  provisional ballot envelope and  return it to the warden.
14 4.  Provisional  ballots  segregated and logged.  The warden shall place a provisional 
15 ballot envelope containing a provisional  ballot  completed under  this section in a 
16 tamper- proof container until the identity of the person marking the ballot  can be verified 
17 by photographic  identification as required  by section  671, subsection 1. The warden also 
18 shall complete a provisional  ballot log, on a form provided  by the Secretary of State, that 
19 indicates for each provisional ballot the name  of the voter,  the provisional ballot number 
20 and a notation of whether the provisional ballot  was resolved and cast. The sealed 
21 tamper- proof containers of provisional ballots that are not resolved  must be returned to 
22 the municipal  clerk after the polls are closed.  Provisional  ballot affidavits and the 
23 provisional ballot log form must be sealed in tamper -proof containers separately from the 
24 provisional ballots  and returned to the municipal clerk.
25 5.  Resolution and counting of provisional ballots.   When a provisional  ballot is 
26 cast under this section, the municipal clerk or  registrar shall proceed as follows.
27 A.  If the identity of a person casting a provisional ballot  under this section is verified 
28 upon presentation of acceptable photographic identification by the close of the polls 
29 on election day, the clerk or registrar shall designate on the provisional ballot log 
30 under subsection 4 that the provisional ballot  was accepted.  The warden shall  remove 
31 the provisional ballot  from the sealed  provisional ballot envelope and place it into the 
32 ballot box or tabulator to be counted with the other  ballots after the polls close.  The 
33 election clerk  in charge  of the incoming  voting list shall  annotate the incoming voting 
34 list to indicate that the  voter  voted.
35 B.  If the identity of a person casting a provisional  ballot under this section  is verified 
36 upon presentation of acceptable photographic  identification after the close of the polls 
37 on election day, but not later than the 3rd business day after the election, the clerk or 
38 registrar shall designate on the provisional  ballot log under  subsection 4 that the 
39 provisional ballot was accepted. The clerk or registrar, in the presence of one or more 
40 witnesses, shall remove the provisional ballot  from  the sealed provisional ballot  
41 envelope and place it into a ballot box in a manner that preserves the secrecy of the 
42 vote. After  all accepted  provisional ballots have been  placed into the ballot box, the 
43 clerk or registrar shall remove and count the provisional ballots in the same manner 
44 as regular ballots. After the incoming voting list is unsealed  following the election, 
Page 3 - 128LR2926(01)-11 the clerk or registrar shall annotate the list to add the names  and addresses  of the 
2 voters under  this subsection,  along with an indication that the voters voted.
3 C.  If a person casting a provisional ballot  under this section  has not presented 
4 photographic identification acceptable to verify  the person's identity within  3 
5 business days after the election, the clerk or registrar  shall write "rejected" on the 
6 provisional ballot envelope  and return the unopened envelope to the tamper-proof  
7 container. The clerk  or registrar shall update the provisional ballot log under 
8 subsection 4 to indicate  the ballot was rejected.
9 D.  Rejected provisional ballots, provisional ballot affidavits and the provisional 
10 ballot logs must be  maintained as provided by section  23, subsection 7.
11 6.  Report to Secretary of State.  No later than 3 business days after an election,  the 
12 clerk shall  report the status of all provisional ballots of the municipality  under  this section 
13 to the Secretary  of State  by providing a copy  of the provisional ballot log under 
14 subsection 4. In addition to annotating the provisional ballot  log to indicate whether 
15 provisional ballots were  accepted or rejected,  the clerk shall update the municipality's 
16 return of votes cast to include the votes cast by all provisional  voters who presented 
17 acceptable photographic identification.
18 7.  Secretary  of State to make status available.  Within 20 days after an election, 
19 the Secretary of State shall make  available  on the Secretary of State's publicly accessible 
20 website the total number of provisional ballots under this section for that election, 
21 including the number of ballots  that were counted and the number of ballots that were not 
22 counted.  For a ballot  that was not counted, the reason  the ballot was not counted must be 
23 included.
24 Sec. 4.  29-A MRSA §1410, sub-§12  is enacted  to read:
25 12.  Identification cards for the purpose  of voting.   A person who submits an 
26 application for a nondriver identification card is not required to pay the fee required by 
27 subsection 2 if the  person  attests in the application  that:
28 A.  The person does not have photographic identification acceptable for the 
29 verification of the person's identity for the purpose of voting as required by Title  
30 21-A, section 671, subsection 1; and 
31 B.  The person  is applying for a nondriver identification card solely for the purpose of 
32 voting.
33 SUMMARY
34 This bill requires  that a voter  provide proof of identity  with photographic 
35 identification for the purpose of voting.  The bill specifies the types  of photographic  
36 identification that may be used to verify the identity of a voter.   It provides  that a person 
37 who does not present photographic identification may cast a provisional ballot  and 
38 establishes the process for provisional voting.  Under this process,  if the person can verify 
39 the person's  identity to the municipal clerk, deputy clerk  or warden or an election clerk  
40 within 3 business days after the election  by presenting  acceptable photographic  
Page 4 - 128LR2926(01)-11 identification, the ballot will be cast as a regular ballot.  Through the general election of 
2 2018, a person  who does not present acceptable  photographic  identification  but is known 
3 to a municipal  clerk, registrar or election official at the voting place may cast a regular 
4 ballot upon submission of an affidavit by the municipal clerk, registrar or election  official 
5 attesting to the person's  identity.  The bill requires that provisional ballots must be 
6 retained in tamper-proof containers separately from  provisional ballot affidavits and the 
7 provisional ballot log and that rejected  provisional ballots,  provisional ballot logs and 
8 provisional ballot affidavits  must be retained in the same manner  as regular ballots and 
9 election materials.  Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to provide, without a 
10 fee, nondriver  identification cards  to eligible persons  who do not have another form  of 
11 acceptable photographic identification to verify identity for the  purpose of voting.
