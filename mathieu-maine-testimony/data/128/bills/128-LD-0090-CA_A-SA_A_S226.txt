Water District" and inserting the following: 'municipal officers of the Town of Rumford' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment allows the municipal officers of the Town of Rumford, instead of 
the board of trustees of the Rumford Water District, as in the committee amendment, to 
submit to the legal voters of the district the question of whether the charter for the district 
should be amended to require that the legal voters of the district elect trustees, instead of 
having trustees appointed by the municipal officers as the charter currently requires.
