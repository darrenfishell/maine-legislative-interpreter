5 Current law requires that, beginning in fiscal year 2018-19, a portion  of the system 
6 administration allocation must be allocated to school  administrative units  that have  
7 established regionalized administrative  services.  This bill retains  the portion  of the law 
8 that establishes the system administration allocation  at $135 per pupil for fiscal  year 
9 2017-18 and repeals provisions that increase  for future fiscal  years the per-pupil amount 
10 and restrict allocation  of portions of the funds to school administrative  units that have  
11 established regionalized administrative services.
