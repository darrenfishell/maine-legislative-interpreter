SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the definition of 11adult education.11 Current law includes 
enrichment courses in the list of options that comprise an adult education program. This 
amendment removes enrichment courses from that list, but keeps enrichment courses as a 
part of 11adult education.11 The amendment clarifies that enrichment courses are not 
subject to requirements placed on other types of courses included in adult education. The 
amendment retains the definition in current law of 11enrichment course11 in order to keep 
enrichment courses in the adult education laws.

No state fiscal impact 
Requiring the property fiscal capacity component of the school funding formula to be based on a 3-year average of the 
prope1ty values of a municipality included in a school administrative uriit (SAU) or on the certified state valuation for 
the most recent prior year, whichever is lower, beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 will not change the total state and 
local cost ofK-12 public education or the state's share of that cost. It may, however, result in a higher mill rate 
expectation which may affect the required local contribution for local school administrative units. The impact to 
individual SAU's can not be determined at this time.
