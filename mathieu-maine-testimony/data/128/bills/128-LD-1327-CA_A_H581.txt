SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. The amendment establishes the Health 
Care Employment for Military Veterans Program within the Department of Labor and 
charges the program with creating a "military-to-civilian crosswalk" that compares the 
military training and experience obtained by individuals who have served in specific 
military health care occupational specialties and the education and experience required to 
obtain national certification or state licensure or certification in equivalent or similar 
civilian health care occupations. The program is also charged with providing direct 
assistance to eligible veterans who seek to enroll in postsecondary education institutions 
and obtain academic credit for their military training and experience as well as eligible 
veterans who seek to secure an apprenticeship or employment in a health care occupation 
in the State. The department is required to operate the program using existing resources 
or available grant funding and, to the extent resources are limited, the program is required 
to give priority to eligible veterans who were discharged or released from military service 
no longer than 2 years prior to seeking assistance.
