1 amount of overcompensation from any wages due. An employer who has

5 3. Violation. If an employer with over 25 employees violates this section, that

7 If an employer with 25 or fewer employees knows of the limitation established by

9 overcompensation. Employers of 25 or fewer employees who do not know of the 
10 limitation established by subsection 2 and who violate this section shall must return all

22 general civil remedies against an employer.' 
23 SUMMARY 
24 This amendment replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. It amends the definition 
25 of "overcompensation" by an employer to include compensation in the form of paid 
26 leave. It changes the maximum amount an employer can withhold from an employee's 
27 pay to recover overcompensation from 10% to 5%. It prohibits an employer from 
28 recovering more than the amount of overcompensation paid to an employee in the 3 years 
29 preceding the discovery of the overcompensation. The amendment also specifies that the 
30 section of law regarding overcompensation by employers that includes these provisions 
31 does not limit or affect an employee's general civil remedies against an employer.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Reducing the maximum amount an employer can withhold from an employee's pay in order to recover 
overcompensation, including overcompensation of paid leave, from 10% to 5% will delay the State's ability to fully 
recoup payments to an employee made in error. Prohibiting an employer from recovering overcompensation paid to 
an employee in e1rnr to three years preceding the date of discove1y of the overcompensation may limit or eliminate the 
State's ability to recover the amount of the error.
