This amendment removes the $150,000 General Fund appropriations for the Department of Corrections in fiscal year 
2017-18, keeps the ongoing annual appropriations of the same amount beginning in fiscal year 2018-19 for the Maine 
Coalition to End Domestic Violence, but sunsets the funding at the end of the 2020-2021 biennium. Any additional 
costs for the Department of Corrections to prepare the required report on the effectiveness of the program are 
assumed to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
