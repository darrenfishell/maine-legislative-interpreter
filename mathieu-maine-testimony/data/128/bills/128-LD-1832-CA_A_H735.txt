It is the intent of the Legislature that actions of public bodies subject to this 
subchapter be taken openly and their deliberations be conducted openly. This section 
governs participation in a public proceeding of such a public body by a member of that 
public body when the member is not physically present. Remote participation, which 
means participation through telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means of 
communication may not be used to defeat the purposes of this subchapter as stated in 
section 401. The Legislature may not allow its members to participate remotely in public 
proceedings of the Legislature. 
1. Remote participation; requirements. Except as provided in subsection 5, a 
public body subject to this subchapter may not allow a member of the public body to 
participate remotely in any of its public proceedings unless the participation is in 
accordance with this subchapter and:· 
A. After notice and public hearing, the public body has adopted a written policy or 
rule that authorizes a member of the public body who is not physically present to 
participate in a public proceeding of that public body in a manner that allows all 
members to simultaneously hear and speak to each other during the public proceeding 
and allows members of the public attending the public proceeding at the location 
identified in the notice required by section 406 to hear all members of the public 
body. The policy may not allow remote participation in executive sessions. The

that was discussed in an executive session if the executive session immediately 
precedes the proceeding in which the vote is taken; 
B. For public bodies consisting of 3 or fewer members, at least one member is 
physically present at the location identified in the notice required by section 406: and, 
for public bodies of more than 3 members, a quorum is physically present at the 
location identified in the notice required by section 406, unless immediate action is

required under this paragraph must be made by the presiding officer of the public 
body and the facts supporting that determination must be included in the record of the 
meeting. A public body of 3 or more members may not consider matters other than 
those requiring immediate action in a public proceeding held pursuant to this 
subsection when a quorum is not physically present. Every member must be 
physically present for at least one proceeding each year; 
C. Each member of the public body who is participating in the public proceeding

F. Each member of the public body who is participating in the public proceeding 
remotely receives any documents or other materials presented or discussed at the 
public proceeding in advance or when made available at the public proceeding if the 
transmission technology is available. Failure to comply with this subsection does not 
invalidate an action of the body. 
2. State public bodies. The policy under subsection 1 applicable to a state public 
body must be adopted by the public body as a major substantive rule under the Maine 
Administrative Procedure Act. 
3. County and municipal public bodies, A county or municipality may by 
ordinance require stricter requirements than those set out in this section and may prohibit 
remote participation by any public body under its jurisdiction. 
4. Elected public bodies. A public body consisting of elected members may adopt a 
policy under subsection 1 only after the constituents of the public body have voted to 
authorize the public body to adopt the remote participation policy. The public body must 
provide notice and hold a separate hearing before adopting the remote participation 
policy. 
5. Exceptions. The following public bodies are exempt from the provisions of this 
section and a member of the following bodies may participate in a public proceeding of 
the public body when the member is not physically present:

29 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "H" to H.P. 1274, L.D. 1832 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
This amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
1. It prohibits remote participation in executive session. It also prohibits a member 
who is participating remotely in a proceeding from voting on an issue that was discussed 
in executive session that immediately preceded the vote in the public proceeding. 
2. It changes, for public bodies that consist of 3 or fewer members, the requirement 
that a quorum be physically present. It requires at least one member of the public body of 
3 or fewer members to be physically present at the location identified in the meeting 
notice. 
3. It requires that each member of a public body subject to the Freedom of Access 
Act be physically present in at least one public proceeding each year. 
4. It requires that a state public body adopt its remote participation policy as a major 
substantive rule under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act. 
5. It authorizes municipalities and counties to impose stricter requirements than are 
provided in this amendment and allows municipalities and counties to prohibit the use of 
remote participation by any public body under their jurisdictions. The stricter 
requirements or the prohibition must be imposed through the adoption of an ordinance by 
the municipality or the county. 
6, It provides that an elected public body may adopt a remote patiicipation policy 
only after the constituency of the elected public body has voted to authorize the body to 
adopt the policy. 
7. It provides, in Parts A and B, that the exemptions for the 7 entities whose statutes 
currently provide for remote patiicipation expire on July 1, 2022. Those entities will 
need to adopt policies that comply with the law to continue any remote participation. 
8. It amends, in Pati C, the Freedom of Access Act to require the joint standing 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters to conduct a 
review of any proposed statutory authorization of remote patiicipation or change in 
accessibility with respect to public proceedings.
