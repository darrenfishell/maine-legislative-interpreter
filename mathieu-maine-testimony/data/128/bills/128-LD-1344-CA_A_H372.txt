FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 934, L.D. 1344, Bill, "An Act To 
Assess and Improve the Quality of Physical Education in Kinderga1ten to Grade 12" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act Regarding Waivers for Physical Education Requirements in Kindergarten 
to Grade 12' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 2 and 3. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, provides a new title 
and removes the sections of the bill that direct the Department of Education to conduct a 
comprehensive assessment of physical education offered to kindergarten to grade 12 
students in public schools and to report on that assessment. It leaves the section of the 
bill that provides that the Commissioner of Education may not consider financial hardship 
as a basis for granting a school administrative unit a waiver from physical education 
requirements.
