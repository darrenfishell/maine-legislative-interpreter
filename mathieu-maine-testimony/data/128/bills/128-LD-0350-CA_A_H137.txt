16 COMMIITEE AMENDMENT"/{ ,, to H.P. 256, L.D. 350 
3. Exception. This section does not apply to a firearms wholesaler who sells only to 
other firearms dealers or to a firearms manufacturer who sells only at wholesale.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and amends the provision of law that requires a 
firearms dealer who sells, lets or loans a firearm to make a copy of the form the dealer 
must keep pursuant to federal law and to show that copy to a law enforcement officer or 
prosecuting attorney as follows. 
1. Like the bill, it removes the requirement that a dealer make a state copy of that 
federal form; 
2. It requires a dealer to show to or allow inspection of that federal form by a state 
law enforcement officer or prosecuting attorney upon presentation of a formal written 
request for inspection stating that the form relates to an active criminal investigation; and 
3. It retains the exception currently in law regarding the sale of firearms by a 
wholesaler to a dealer or another wholesaler.
