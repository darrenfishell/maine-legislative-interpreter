Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Requiring that the State recognize 100% of a public charter school1s operating allocation within essential programs 
and services will increase the total cost of public education from kindergarten to grade 12 beginning in fiscal year 
2018-19. Although the amount can not be determined at this time, had this legislation required this provision be put 
into effect for fiscal year 2017-18 it would increase the total cost of K-12 public education, as proposed in LD 390, 
the Governor1s 2018-2019 biennial budget, by approximately $942,790. The amount of this cost increase not funded 
by the State will be borne by local school administrative units.
