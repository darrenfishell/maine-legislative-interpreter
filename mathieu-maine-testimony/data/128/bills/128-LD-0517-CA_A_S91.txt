15 This amendment changes the allowance for a nursing facility medical director from 
16 $10,000 to $22,000. The bill proposes to remove the allowance cap entirely. The 
17 amendment changes the amount above which a residential care facility would need 
18 Department of Health and Human Services approval for new construction, acquisitions 
19 and renovations to $500,000 rather than $2,000,000 as in the bill. It also clarifies that 
20 residential facilities may be reimbursed for costs to comply with changes in local 
21 ordinances in addition to federal or state laws. The amendment also adds an 
22 appropriations and allocations section.

The bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $26,448 in fiscal 
year 2017-18 and $28,862 in fiscal year 2018-19 for nursing facilites to increase the cap on the cost of a Medical 
Director from $10,000 to $22,000. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations will also be required for the FMAP match 
and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations for the increased nursing facilities tax. 
This bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to pennit capital expenditures by residential care 
facilities (RCF) that are less than $500,000 without prior approval and to provide an extraordinary circumstance 
allowance in pennitted reimbursement to RCF's. Costs incurred by an RCF to comply with federal or state laws, 
regulations and rules shall be considered reasonable and necessary costs. These additional changes to the Residential 
Care Facilities will increase costs that will largely be necessitated by decisions of the RCFs that cannot be projected 
by the department. Since new construction, acquisitions, and renovations apply to room and board and not direct care, 
which cannot be reimbursed with federal funds per 42 CPR 440.182, it is also expected that these costs would be 
reimbursed entirely by the General Fund.
