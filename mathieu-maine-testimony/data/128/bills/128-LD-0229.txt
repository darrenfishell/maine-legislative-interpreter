 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §3104, sub -§2, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 412, §1, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Requirement.  An Except as provided in this section, an  investor -owned 4 
transmission and distribution utility shall adopt and ordinarily follow as a general 5 
operating policy a schedule of reading customer meters on a monthly basis.  Any 6 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility that plans to adopt a different policy, 7 
such as bimonthly meter read ings or meter readings in accordance with subsection 3 , 8 
must receive prior approval of the commission.  9 
Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3104, sub -§3 is enacted to read:  10 
3.  Meter reading and billing option.   An investor -owned transmission and 11 
distribution utility may, with the prior approval of the commission, adopt in accordance 12 
with this subsection a meter reading and billing policy for customers using 13 
electromechanical meters, as defined in section 3106, that involves reading customer 14 
meters as infrequently as once e very 12 months.  The policy may not involve reading 15 
meters less frequently than once every 12 months.  The policy may include a monthly 16 
billing method that bases charges on an average of the customer's previous actual 17 
electricity consumption over a period of up to 18 months.  The policy may provide for 18 
meter readings by a customer between readings by the utility if the utility provides 19 
guidance to the customer on how to read a meter and a method that does not impose a 20 
cost on the customer for the customer t o provide the readings to the utility.  The policy 21 
must establish a process by which the utility provides a refund to a customer if a billing 22 
based on average usage results in an overpayment by a customer and an appropriate 23 
rebilling of a customer if such a billing results in an underpayment by the customer.   The 24 
commission may adopt routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 25 
subchapter 2 -A to implement this subsection.  26 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3106 is enacted to read:  27 
§3106.  Smart meter opt -out fees and charges prohibited  28 
1.  Definitions.   As used in this section, the following terms have the following 29 
meanings.  30 
A.  "Electromechanical meter" means a meter used to measure electricity 31 
consumption that is not a wireless smart meter.  32 
B.  "Wireless  smart meter" means an electronic metering device to measure 33 
electricity consumption that reports that consumption by wireless, radio frequency 34 
communication.  35 
2.  Prohibition.   A transmission and distribution utility may not charge a customer a 36 
fee, monthl y charge or higher rate for declining the installation of a wireless smart meter 37 
or for the removal of a wireless smart meter. A transmission and distribution utility may 38 
not charge a customer for costs associated with that customer's choosing an 39 
electrome chanical meter.  40 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0667(01) -1 
 All costs incurred by a transmission and distribution utility as a result of a customer's 1 
choosing an electromechanical meter are just and reasonable for rate -making purposes.  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill prohibits a transmission and distribution util ity from charging a customer a 4 
fee, monthly charge or higher rate for declining the installation of a wireless smart meter 5 
or for the removal of a wireless smart meter. A transmission and distribution utility is 6 
prohibited from including any costs associat ed with a customer's choosing an 7 
electromechanical meter in rates charged to that customer.  8 
With approval by the Public Utilities Commission, an investor -owned transmission 9 
and distribution utility may decrease the number of times an electromechanical mete r is 10 
read for a customer that declines the installation of a wireless smart meter but may not 11 
read the meter less frequently than once every 12 months and may establish a rate 12 
collection method that is based upon the average electricity consumption of the customer. 13 
If a transmission and distribution utility prefers a more frequent electromechanical meter 14 
reading, the utility may establish a method for a customer to provide the utility with a 15 
more frequent electromechanical meter reading, as long as the meth od does not impose a 16 
cost on the customer. This bill requires the utility to establish a process by which the 17 
utility provides a refund to a customer if a billing based on average usage results in an 18 
overpayment by a customer and an appropriate rebilling o f a customer if such a billing 19 
results in an underpayment by the customer.  20
