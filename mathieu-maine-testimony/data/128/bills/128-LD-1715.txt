2 CONCEPT DRAFT
3 SUMMARY
4 This bill is  a concept  draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.
5 This bill proposes to ensure that patient populations located in rural areas of the State 
6 receive safe and effective  health care by placing certain reporting  and approval  
7 requirements on an acute  care or critical  access  hospital  that is considering closure  or 
8 terminating or reducing  services.  Any such hospital would  need to provide  at least 6 
9 monthsâ€™ notice to the joint standing committee  of the Legislature having  jurisdiction over 
10 health and human services matters prior to the planned date of closure of the hospital or 
11 the termination or reduction of services.   The hospital would also need to provide  a study 
12 to the committee  conducted by an independent 3rd party describing the impact of the 
13 closure or the termination  or reduction of services  on the patient  population.  Any closure  
14 or any termination or reduction  of services would require approval prior to taking effect.
