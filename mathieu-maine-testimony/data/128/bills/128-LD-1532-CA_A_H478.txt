Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Any additional costs to the Maine Harness Racing Commission within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation, 
and Forestry as a result of modifications to the statutes governing harness racing are anticipated to be minor and can 
be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Removing the requirement to print booklets containing the harness 
racing rules and laws will reduce costs by a minor amount.
