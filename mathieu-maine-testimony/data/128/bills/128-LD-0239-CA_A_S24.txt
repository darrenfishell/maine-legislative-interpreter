This amendment replaces the bill. Like the bill, the amendment removes the

have applied for or are receiving financial assistance from the State or the municipality.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill removes the exemption provided to national banks from the law requiring financial institutions to provide 
account balance information to the State or to a municipality for persons who have applied for or are receiving 
financial assistance from the State or a municipality. The bill also requires a release form be obtained before 
information is released and that a notarized affidavit be used when the depositor is deceased. The savings to the 
Department of Health and Human Services are not expected to be significant because numerous financial institutions 
already had to comply with this rule. Also, recipients typically do not stay in the program, having to reapply each 
month they seek help. A more precise estimate of the fiscal impact is not possible because recipient data related to 
number of months on assistance, amounts paid to each recipient, number ofrecipients who return and the frequency of 
an account balance check denying a benefit resides at the municipal level and varies over time.
