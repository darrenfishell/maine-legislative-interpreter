SUMMARY  12 
Current law allows a temporary sign, including, but not limited to, a sign bearing a 13 
political message relating to an election, primary or referendum, to be placed in the public 14 
right -of-way for a maximum of 6 weeks per calen dar year.  15 
This bill allows a temporary sign to be placed in the public right -of-way for a 16 
maximum of 12 weeks per calendar year, as long as that sign is not displayed for more 17 
than 6 weeks before the event to which the sign relates.  This bill also removes  the 18 
requirement that temporary signs be labeled with the name and address of the entity that 19 
placed the sign within the public way and the time period for which the sign will be 20 
maintained.  21
