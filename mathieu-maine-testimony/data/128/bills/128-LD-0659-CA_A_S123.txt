suspended until December 31, 2023 except to the extent provided in section 3962 and the

under the authority of Section 1341 of the federal Affordable Care Act commences 
operations in this State until December 31, 2017. 
A. If the board proposes a revised plan of operation that calls for the resumption of 
operations earlier than December 31, 2023 and the superintendent dete1mines that the 
revised plan is likely to provide significant benefit to the State's health insurance 
market, the superintendent may order the association to resume operations in

4 may develop a proposal for an innovation waiver under Section 1332 of the federal 
5 Affordable Care Act that facilitates the resumption of operations of the association in 
6 a manner that prevents or minimizes the loss of federal funding to support the 
7 affordability of health insurance in the State. 
8 C. With the approval of the Governor, the superintendent may submit an application 
9 on behalf of the State in accordance with the proposal developed under paragraph B 
10 for the purposes of resuming operations of the association to the United States 
11 Department of Health and Human Services and to the United States Secretaty of the
