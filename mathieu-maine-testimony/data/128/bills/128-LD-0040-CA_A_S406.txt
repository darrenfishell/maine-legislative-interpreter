Pursuant to the Mandate Preamble, the two-thirds vote of all members elected to each House exempts the State from 
the constitutional requirement to fund 90% of the additional costs. 
Correctional and Judicial Impact State_ments 
Establishes new civil violations. 
The collection of additional fines may also increase General Fund revenue by minor amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Elevating the priority of water lead abatement or mitigation from a "Priority 2" status to a "Priority I" status for the 
use of loans that school administrative units may receive from the School Revolving Renovation Fund for school 
repairs and renovations may result in less funds being available for loans for other eligible projects. 
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates that expenditures would increase due to an 
increased number of water tests. These costs would be offset by an increase in revenue from the charge for each test. 
The exact amount of these increases cannot be determined at this time.
