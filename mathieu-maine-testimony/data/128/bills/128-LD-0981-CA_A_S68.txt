Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium revenue decrease -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill prohibits the Treasurer of State from depositing funds or investing in securities in any corporation or 
institution involved in financing the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Based upon current investments 
within the state's cash pool, the Treasurer has indicated that General Fund revenues could be reduced by 
approximately $210,000 each year. 
Because this legislation requires the Maine Public Employees Retirement System to divest its holdings in any 
corporation or company that is constructing or funding construction of the Dakota Access pipeline only if it is in 
accordance with sound investment criteria and consistent with its fiduciary obligations, there will be no negative fiscal 
impact to the system.
