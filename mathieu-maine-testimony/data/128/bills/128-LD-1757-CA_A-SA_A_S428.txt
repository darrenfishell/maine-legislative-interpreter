Amend the amendment by adding before the summary the following: 
'Amend the bill by striking out all of the emergency clause.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the timing for minimum wage increases by starting with 
$10.50 per hour on January 1, 2019 and increasing it by 50¢ per hour each year until it 
reaches $12.00 per hour on January 1, 2022. Starting January 1, 2023 and annually 
thereafter the minimum wage is increased by any increase in the cost of living as 
measured by the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical 
Workers, CPI-W. The amendment also strikes from Committee Amendment 11A11 the 
provisions that establish a special minimum wage applicable to unemancipated minors 
under 18 years of age for the first 200 work hours of employment. The amendment also 
removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause.
