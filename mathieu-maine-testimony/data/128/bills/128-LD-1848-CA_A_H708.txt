transmission and distribution utility elects to implement an arrearage management 
program, it must do so in accordance with this subsection and rules adopted pursuant to 
this subsection. The commission shall establish requirements relating to the arrearage 
management programs by rule. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine 
technical rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
In adopting rules regarding arrearage management programs, the commission shall: 
A. Consider best practices as developed and implemented in other states or regions; 
B. Require that an arrearage management program include an electricity usage 
assessment at no cost to the participant;
