The commission may permit, but may not require, investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utilities to enter into contracts for differences that are designed and intended 
to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from transmission 
development. To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 
for long-term contracts for investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities under 
this subsection having the same legal and financial effect as the procedures used for 
standard-offer service pursuant to section 3212 for investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utilities. 
The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible, demand response or energy 
efficiency capacity resources. These contracts are not subject to the rules of the State 
Purchasing Agent. In a competitive solicitation conducted pursuant to subsection 6, the 
commission shall allow transmission and distribution utilities to submit bids for 
interruptible or demand response capacity resources. 
Capacity resources contracted under this subsection may not exceed the amount 
necessary to ensure the reliability of the electric grid of this State, to meet the energy 
efficiency program budget allocations articulated in the triennial plan as approved by the 
commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4 or any annual update plan approved 
by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 6 or to lower customer costs as 
determined by the commission pursuant to rules adopted under subsection 10. 
Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a capacity 
resource may not be contracted under this subsection unless the commission determines 
that the capacity resource is recognized as a capacity resource for purposes of any 
regional or federal capacity requirements. 
The commission shall ensure that any long-term contract authorized under this subsection 
is consistent with the State's goals for greenhouse gas reduction under Title 38, section 
576 and the regional greenhouse gas initiative as described in the state climate action plan 
required in Title 38, section 577. 
By Janua1y 1st of each year, the commission shall submit a report to the joint standing 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters on the 
procurement of transmission capacity. capacity resources. energy and renewable energy

commission for long-term contracts. the number of responses to requests for proposals 
pursuant to which a contract has been finalized. the number of executed term sheets or 
contracts resulting from the requests for proposals. the commission's initial estimates of 
ratepayer costs or savings associated with any approved term sheet, actual ratepayer costs 
or savings for the previous year associated with any procurement. the total ratepayer costs 
or savings at the time of the report and the megawatt-hours. renewable energy credits or
