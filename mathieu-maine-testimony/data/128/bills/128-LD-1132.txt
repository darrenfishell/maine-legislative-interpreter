 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §7303 is enacted to read:  2 
§7303.  Education savings accounts  3 
The department shall, in accordance with this section, establish education savings 4 
accounts, referred to in this s ection as "savings accounts," for children with disabilities.  5 
Savings accounts may be used by the parents or legal guardians of such children for 6 
educational purposes in accordance with this section.  7 
1.  Establish savings accounts.   The department by rule  shall establish an application 8 
process for a parent or legal guardian of a child with disabilities to request the 9 
establishment of a savings account.  An application requesting establishment of a savings 10 
account must be submitted to the department no late r than January 1st preceding the 11 
school year in which the account will be used.  The department may establish a savings 12 
account only upon a demonstration by the parent or legal guardian that the child has been 13 
enrolled in a public school for at least one s chool year and that an individualized 14 
education program has been determined for the child.  15 
2.  Renewal, rollover and closure.   The department may annually renew a savings 16 
account and deposit funds into the account in accordance with subsection 3 if, in 17 
accordance with rules adopted by the department, the parent or legal guardian 18 
demonstrates that the child continues to have and follow an individualized education 19 
program and has completed a national norm -referenced achievement test.  Unspent funds 20 
in a savin gs account that is renewed remain in the savings account and may be used in 21 
accordance with subsection 4, except that no more than 75% of the funds deposited in any 22 
year may be carried forward.  Any unspent amount that is in excess of 75% of the funds 23 
depo sited in that year must be transferred at the end of the fiscal year to the State 24 
Controller for handling in accordance with subsection 5.  If the requirements of this 25 
subsection are not met, the department shall close the savings account and transfer all 26 
funds in the savings account to the State Controller, who shall handle the funds as 27 
provided in subsection 5.  28 
3.  Maintenance of fund for postsecondary education.  After a child for whom a 29 
savings account has been created graduates from high school, no fur ther funds may be 30 
deposited in the account, but to the extent there are funds remaining in the account, the 31 
fund, at the request of the child or the parent or legal guardian of the child, must, in 32 
accordance with rules adopted by the department, remain ope n and available to help fund 33 
a postsecondary course of education for the child.  If the child does not enroll in such a 34 
course within 4 years after graduating, the department shall close the savings account and 35 
transfer all funds in the savings account to the State Controller, who shall handle the 36 
funds as provided in subsection 5.  37 
4.  Funding and oversight.   The department shall administer and oversee savings 38 
accounts as follows.  39

administrative unit under chapter 606 -B.  The department shall also direct that school 2 
administrative unit to deposit into the savings account 90% of the school 3 
administrative unit's required contribution to the unit's total cost of education 4 
attributable to that child.  The department shall calculate these amounts and shall 5 
allocate the stat e funds to the extent possible in a manner consistent with the 6 
schedules applicable to state subsidy payments pursuant to section 15689 -B. 7 
B.  The department and the State Controller may each separately receive up to 1/5 of 8 
that 10% of the state subsidy at tributable to a child for whom a savings account is 9

paragraph may be used to pay the costs of administering this section.  11

A parent or legal guardian of a child may not use funds in a savings account to pay in 31 
cash for any educational expense under this paragraph.  32 
D.  On a quarterly basis the department shall review all expenditures from savings 33 
accounts to ensure that they are in acco rdance with the requirements of this 34 
subsection and rules adopted under this section.  If at any time the department finds 35 
that expenditures from a savings account are not in accordance with the requirements 36 
of this subsection or rules adopted under this s ection, the department shall notify the 37 
parent or legal guardian of the child of the apparent misuse of funds and shall freeze 38 
the account so that no further expenditures may be made.  If, after an opportunity for 39 
hearing, the department determines that th ere was no misuse of funds, it shall 40 
unfreeze the account.  If the department determined there was in fact a misuse of 41

 funds, the department shall direct the parent or legal guardian to repay within 30 days 1

5.  Funds returned.  Any funds transferred out of or removed from a savings account 11 
or paid to the State by the par ent or legal guardian of a child under this section and 12 
received by the State Controller must be handled by the State Controller in accordance 13 
with this subsection.  The State Controller shall divide the funds in the same proportion as 14 
the funds are deposi ted in the savings account from the State and the school 15 
administrative unit pursuant to subsection 4 and return the portion attributable to the 16 
school administrative unit to that unit and transfer the remainder to the unappropriated 17 
surplus of the General  Fund.  18 
6.  Rules.   The department shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.  19

14.  Adjustment for education savings accounts.   The commissioner shall reduce 23 
the state share of the total allocation to a school administrative unit in any year in which 24 
one or more education savings accounts under section 7303 are established  for children 25 
within that school administrative unit.  The amount of the reduction must equal the total 26 
state subsidy that is attributable to all children in that school administrative unit for whom 27 
education savings accounts have been established, as dete rmined by the department 28 
pursuant to section 7303, subsection 3, paragraph A.  29 
SUMMARY  30 
This bill directs the Department of Education to establish education savings accounts 31 
for children with disabilities that may be used by the parents or legal guardians of  such 32 
children for certain educational purposes.  The funding for these accounts would come 33 
from shifting 90% of the essential programs and services funding that would otherwise be 34 
provided by the State and the school administrative unit for the child into  the savings 35 
account.  The bill provides mechanisms for approval of educational expenditures and 36 
review of spending from the accounts.  37
