5. Fee. The fee for a~ guide license is $-8-1-$135. 
Sec. 4. 12 MR.SA §12853, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 414, Pt. A, §2 and 
affected by c. 614, §9, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:

Statutes, Title 12, section 12853, subsections 5 and 6 talce effect January 1, 2019. 
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation talces effect when approved.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which creates an exception to the background 
check requirement for certain applicants for guide licenses. Like the bill, the amendment 
extends the term of a guide license from 3 years to 5 years, and it correspondingly 
increases the fee for a guide license from $81 to $135; however, unlike the bill, those 
changes talce effect January 1, 2019. The amendment establishes a Class E crime for 
failing to notify the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife of a conviction or a 
finding of not criminally responsible that is grounds for the revocation, suspension or 
denial of a guide license within 30 days of the conviction or finding and provides that 
failure to notify is grounds for permanent revocation or denial of a guide license.

Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Establishes new Class E crimes; the collection of additional fines may also increase General Fund revenue by minor 
amounts. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill extends the te1111 of a guide license from 3 years to 5 years and increases the license fee to compensate for 
lost revenue from less frequent renewal. In the first 3 years after implementation, all existing licenses will expire and 
be renewed at the higher fee and General Fund revenue will be increased. In the forth and fifth years (future 
biennium) after implementation there will be no licenses renewed at all, eliminating all renewal revenue credited to 
the General Fund in those two years. Over the entire 5 year period, there will be no net impact to revenue. This phase­
in effect will occur in subsequent 5-year periods but will be diminished over time as new guides are added and old 
ones are removed and renewals randomly become more evenly distributed. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as a result of changes to its authority to 
revoke a guide license under ce1iain circumstances will be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
