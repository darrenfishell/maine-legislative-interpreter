19 SUMMARY 
20 This amendment retains the provisions of the bill that remove veterinarians from the 
21 definition of "prescriber" in the laws governing the Controlled Substances Prescription 
22 Monitoring Program so that veterinarians are not required to check the program when 
23 prescribing controlled substances, including opioids. The amendment provides that 
24 veterinarians who dispense benzodiazepines or opioid medications for animals are 
25 dispensers within the Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program. It 
26 requires a veterinarian who dispenses a benzodiazepine or an opioid medication to check 
27 prescription monitoring information except when the veterinarian is operating in mobile 
28 or emergency circumstances or is dispensing less than 48 hours of medication. The 
29 amendment reestablishes the waiver on electronic prescribing of opioids that expired on 
3 0 July 1, 2017. The amendment includes benzodiazepines under the waiver and provides 
31 that the waiver extends until July 1, 2022 unless an electronic platform becomes available 
32 earlier as determined by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services. After 
33 electronic prescribing is required, veterinarians may apply for a waiver from the 
34 Commissioner of Health and Human Services. The amendment retains the changes made 
35 by the bill to the continuing education requirements for veterinarians but reduces the 
36 amount of continuing education required for administration, prescription and 
3 7 management of controlled substances from 3 hours every 2 years to one hour every 2 
3 8 years and specifies that the requirements apply to veterinarians who prescribe 
39 benzodiazepines as well as to veterinarians who prescribe opioid medications. It allows 
40 the State Board of Veterinary Medicine to adopt rules rather than requiring rulemaking.
