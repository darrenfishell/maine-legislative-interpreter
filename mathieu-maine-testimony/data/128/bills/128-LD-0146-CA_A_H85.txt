10 SUMMARY 
11 The bill amends the law governing the confidentiality of personal information of 
12 municipal employees to parallel the same protections for state employees, with the 
13 addition of keeping as confidential any genetic information and infonnation about the 
14 sexual orientation of the employee if contained in the records of the municipality. This 
15 amendment amends the state employee personnel records provisions to include 
16 confidentiality of genetic information and sexual orientation and amends the laws 
17 governing county employee personnel records to match. This amendment includes cross-
18 references to the Maine Human Rights Act for the definition of "sexual orientation." It 
19 also correctly provides for the confidentiality of a municipal employee's social security 
20 number.
