intention to pursue its right of first refusal during the 90 -day period, the authority has an 29 
additional 90 days, beginning on the date of the termination of the first refusal period  the 30

mutual agreement between the authority and the owner of the property.  33 
A.  Nothing in this section prevents an owner of the property from deciding not to 34

assistance and revoking the notice required by subsection 1 at any time before its 36
