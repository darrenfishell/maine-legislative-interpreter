 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2722, as amended by PL 1987, c. 362, §1, is repealed and the 2

§2722.  Annual tax  4 
An excise tax is imposed upon the privilege of using one's land in commercial 5 
forestry enterprise in this State.  6 
1.  Rate; definition.   An owner of commercial forest land shall pay an excise tax at 7 
the rate of 26¢ per acre. For the purposes of this subsection, "commercial forest land" 8 
means land that is classified or t hat is eligible for classification as forest land pursuant to 9 
the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law, except that "commercial forest land" does not include 10 
land described in section 573, subsection 3, paragraph B or C when all commercial 11 
harvesting of forest produc ts is prohibited. In determining whether land not classified 12 
under the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law is eligible for classification under that law, all 13 
facts and circumstances must be considered, including whether the landowner is engaged 14 
in the forest product s business and the land is being used in that business or there is a 15 
forest management plan for commercial use of the land or a particular parcel of land has 16 
been harvested for commercial purposes within the preceding 5 years.  17 
2.  Exemption.   The State, mu nicipalities and the Federal Government are not subject 18 
to the excise tax imposed by this section.  19 
3.  Minimum tax.   If the amount calculated under this chapter is less than $5, the 20 
amount assessed must be $5.  21 
Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §2723 -A, as amended by PL 199 7, c. 24, Pt. C, §6 and PL 2011, 22 
c. 657, Pt. W, §6, is repealed.  23 
Sec. 3.  36 MRSA §2724, as amended by PL 1993, c. 452, §15, is repealed.  24 
SUMMARY  25 
Currently the State Tax Assessor is required annually to calculate and determine the 26 
rate of the excise tax im posed upon owners of land used for commercial forestry using 27 
information provided by the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 28 
regarding expenditures and revenue for forest fire protection for the current and preceding 29 
year.  30 
This bill simp lifies the process and provides greater predictability by establishing an 31 
excise tax of 26¢ per acre of commercial forest land.  This bill also repeals the current 32 
formula and a definition that is no longer necessary due to the repeal of the formula.  33
