128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 152, L.D. 196, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Personal Infotmation of Participants in a Community Well-being Check Program" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 3 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 3. 1 MRSA §402, sub-§3, ,Vis enacted to read: 
V. Participant application materials and other personal information obtained or 
maintained by a municipality or other public entity in administering a community 
well-being check program, except that a participant's personal information, including 
health information, may be made available to first responders only as necessary to 
implement the program. For the purposes of this paragraph, "community well-being 
check program" means a voluntary program that involves daily, or regular, contact 
with a participant and, when contact cannot be established, sends first responders to 
the participant's residence to check on the participant's well-being.' 
SUMMARY 
The bill creates a public records exception under the Freedom of Access Act to 
protect the confidentiality of personal information of patiicipants in community 
well-being check programs. 
This amendment revises the bill to provide that the infmmation may be made 
available to first responders but only as necessary to implement the program. It also 
amends the bill to take out the limitation to telephone contact between the patiicipant and 
the program, allowing any form of contact that the program uses. It also revises the 
language to use the broader term of "first responder" to cover the persons who the 
program sends to check on the participant's well-being and who may receive the personal 
information about the participant only when necessaty to implement the program.
