use of equipment before the commission may enter an order.  21 
2.  It adds unlit fiber providers, telecommunications service providers and 22 
information service providers to the list of entiti es that may be subject to an order for 23 
joint use of equipment.  24 
3.  It expands the types of subscribers whose interests must be taken into account by 25 
the commission when taking actions or issuing orders related to joint use of equipment.  26
