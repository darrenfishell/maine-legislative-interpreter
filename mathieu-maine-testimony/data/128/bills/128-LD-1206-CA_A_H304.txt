Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Current biennium cost increase -local school administrative units 
Requiring that the State recognize 100% of the base operating allocation within essential programs and services will 
increase the total cost of public education from kindergarten to grade 12 beginning in fiscal year 2018-19. Although 
the amount can not be determined at this time, had this legislation required this provision be put into effect for fiscal 
year 2017-18 it would increase the total cost ofK-12 public education, as proposed in LD 390, the Governor's 2018-
2019 biennial budget, by approximately $41.9 million. The amount of this cost increase not funded by the State will 
be borne by local school administrative units.
