37 disorder treatment and counseling  that may be provided  to the juvenile while  the juvenile

21 (a)  An employer may require that an employee or applicant  leave any 
22 personal belongings other than clothing and any unnecessary coat, jacket  or 
23 similar outer garments outside the collection  area; or
24 (b)  If it is the standard practice  of an off-site medical facility to require  the 
25 removal of clothing when  collecting a urine sample for any purpose,  the 
26 physician or nurse supervising  the collection of the sample in that facility 
27 may require the  employee or applicant  to remove  their  clothing.
28 (3)  No An employee or applicant may not be required to provide a urine  sample  
29 while being observed, directly or  indirectly, by another individual.
30 (4)  The employer may take additional actions necessary to ensure the integrity of 
31 a urine sample  if the sample collector  or testing laboratory  determines that the 
32 sample may have been substituted, adulterated, diluted  or otherwise  tampered 
33 with in an attempt to influence test results.  The Department of Health and 
34 Human Services shall adopt rules governing when  those additional  actions are 
35 justified and the scope  of those actions.  These rules may not permit  the direct or 
36 indirect observation of the collection of a urine sample.  If an employee or 
37 applicant is found to have twice  substituted, adulterated, diluted  or otherwise 
38 tampered with the employee's or applicant's urine sample,  as determined under 
39 the rules  adopted by the department, the employee or applicant is deemed to have 
40 refused to submit to a substance abuse use test.
Page 48 - 128LR2886(01)-11 (5)  If the employer proposes to use the type of screening test described in section 
2 682, subsection 7, paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the employer's policy  must 
3 include:
4 (a)  Procedures to ensure the confidentiality  of test results as required in 
5 section 685, subsection 3; and
6 (b)  Procedures for training persons performing the test in the proper manner 
7 of collecting samples and reading  results, maintaining a proper chain  of 
8 custody and complying with other applicable provisions of this subchapter;
9 D.  The storage of samples  before testing sufficient to inhibit  deterioration of the 
10 sample;
11 E.  The chain of custody of samples sufficient to protect the sample from tampering  
12 and to verify the identity of each sample and test result;
13 F.  The substances of abuse to  be tested for;
14 G.  The cutoff levels for both screening and confirmation tests at which the presence 
15 of a substance  of abuse in a  sample is considered a  positive test result.
16 (1)  Cutoff levels  for confirmation  tests for marijuana  may not be lower than 15 
17 nanograms of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid per milliliter for 
18 urine samples.
19 (2)  The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt rules under 
20 section 687 regulating screening and confirmation cutoff levels for other 
21 substances of abuse, including those substances tested  for in blood samples  under  
22 subsection 5, paragraph B, to ensure  that levels are set within known tolerances 
23 of test methods and above mere trace amounts.   An employer may request that 
24 the Department of Health  and Human Services establish  a cutoff  level  for any 
25 substance of abuse for  which the department has not established a cutoff level.
26 (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2), if the Department of Health and 
27 Human Services does not have established cutoff levels or procedures for any 
28 specific federally recognized substance abuse use test, the minimum cutoff levels 
29 and procedures  that apply  are those  set forth  in the Federal Register,  Volume 69, 
30 No. 71, sections 3.4 to 3.7 on pages 19697 and 19698;
31 H.  The  consequences of a  confirmed positive substance abuse use test result;
32 I.  The consequences for  refusal to submit  to a substance abuse use test;
33 J.  Opportunities and procedures for rehabilitation  following a confirmed positive 
34 result;
35 K.  A procedure  under  which an employee  or applicant who receives a confirmed 
36 positive result may appeal and contest  the accuracy of that result.   The policy  must 
37 include a mechanism  that provides an opportunity to appeal at no cost to the 
38 appellant; and
39 L.  Any other  matters required by rules adopted by the Department of Labor  under  
40 section 687.
Page 49 - 128LR2886(01)-11 An employer  must shall  consult with the employer's  employees in the development of any 
2 portion of a substance  abuse use testing policy under this subsection that relates to the 
3 employees.  The employer is not required to consult  with the employees  on those portions 
4 of a policy that relate  only to applicants.  The employer shall send a copy of the final 
5 written policy  to the Department of Labor for review under  section  686.  The employer  
6 may not implement the policy until the Department  of Labor  approves the policy.  The 
7 employer shall send a copy  of any proposed change in an approved written policy to the 
8 Department of Labor  for review under section 686.  The employer may not implement the 
9 change until the Department of Labor approves the  change.
10 3.  Copies to employees and applicants.   The employer shall provide  each employee 
11 with a copy of the written  policy  approved  by the Department of Labor under  section  686 
12 at least 30 days before  any portion of the written policy  applicable to employees takes 
13 effect.  The employer shall provide each employee  with a copy  of any change in a written  
14 policy approved by the Department of Labor under  section  686 at least 60 days before 
15 any portion  of the change applicable to employees takes  effect.  The Department of Labor  
16 may waive the 60-day  notice  for the implementation of an amendment covering 
17 employees if the amendment  was necessary  to comply with the law or if, in the judgment 
18 of the department, the amendment promotes the purpose of the law and does not lessen  
19 the protection of an individual employee.  If an employer intends to test an applicant,  the 
20 employer shall provide  the applicant with a copy of the written policy under subsection 2 
21 before administering a substance abuse  use test to the applicant.  The 30-day and 60-day  
22 notice periods  provided  for employees  under this  subsection do not apply to  applicants.
23 4.  Consent  forms prohibited.  An employer may not require, request or suggest that 
24 any employee or applicant sign  or agree to any form  or agreement that attempts to:
25 A.  Absolve  the employer from any potential liability arising out of the imposition of 
26 the substance abuse use test;  or
27 B.  Waive an employee's  or applicant's rights or eliminate or diminish an employer's  
28 obligations under this subchapter  except  as provided  in subsection 4-A.
29 Any form or agreement prohibited by this subsection is  void.
30 4-A.  Waivers  for temporary employment.  An employment  agency, as defined  in 
31 section 611, may request a written waiver for a temporary placement from an individual 
32 already in its employ or on a roster of eligibility as long as the client company  has an 
33 approved substance abuse use testing policy and the individual has not been  assigned 
34 work at the client company in the 30 days previous to the request.  The waiver  is only to 
35 allow a test that might not otherwise  be allowed under this subchapter.  The test must  
36 otherwise comply with the standards of this subchapter and the employment  agency's 
37 approved policy regarding  applicant testing.  The agency  may not take adverse  action 
38 against the individual for  refusal to sign a  waiver.
39 5.  Right to obtain other samples.   At the request of the employee or applicant at the 
40 time the  test sample is  taken, the employer  shall, at that  time:
41 A.  Segregate a portion of the sample for that person's  own testing.  Within  5 days 
42 after notice of the test result  is given to the employee or applicant, the employee or 
Page 50 - 128LR2886(01)-11 applicant shall notify  the employer of the testing laboratory selected  by the employee 
2 or applicant.  This laboratory must  comply with the requirements  of this section 
3 related to testing laboratories.  When the employer  receives notice  of the employee or 
4 applicant's selection, the employer shall  promptly send the segregated  portion of the 
5 sample to the named testing laboratory, subject to the same chain of custody 
6 requirements applicable  to testing of the employer's portion of the sample.   The 
7 employee or applicant shall  pay the costs of these  tests.  Payment for these tests may 
8 not be required  earlier than when notice of the choice  of laboratory is given to the 
9 employer; and
10 B.  In the case of an employee, have a blood sample taken from  the employee  by a 
11 licensed physician, registered physician's assistant, registered nurse or a person  
12 certified by the Department  of Health and Human Services to draw blood samples.   
13 The employer shall have this sample tested  for the presence of alcohol  or marijuana 
14 metabolites, if those substances are to be tested for under  the employer's written  
15 policy.  If the employee  requests that a blood sample  be taken  as provided in this 
16 paragraph, the employer may not test any other sample from the employee for the 
17 presence of these substances.
18 (1)  The Department  of Health and Human Services may identify,  by rules  
19 adopted under section  687, other substances of abuse for which an employee may 
20 request a blood sample be tested instead of a urine sample if the department 
21 determines that a sufficient correlation exists between the presence of the 
22 substance in an individual's blood and its effect  upon the individual's 
23 performance.
24 (2)  No An employer may not require,  request or suggest that any employee  or 
25 applicant provide a blood sample for substance abuse use testing purposes nor 
26 may any employer  conduct a substance abuse use test upon a blood sample  
27 except as  provided in this paragraph.
28 (3)  Applicants  do not have the right  to require the employer to test a blood 
29 sample as provided  in this  paragraph.
30 5-A.  Point of collection screening  test.  Except as provided in this subsection, all 
31 provisions of this subchapter regulating  screening tests apply to noninstrumented  point of 
32 collection test devices described  in section 682, subsection  7, paragraph  A, subparagraph 
33 (1).
34 A.  A noninstrumented point of collection  test described in section  682, subsection 7, 
35 paragraph A, subparagraph  (1) may be performed at the point of collection  rather 
36 than in a laboratory.  Subsections 6 and 7 and subsection 8, paragraphs A to C do not 
37 apply to such screening tests.  Subsection 5 applies  only to a sample that results in a 
38 positive test  result.
39 B.  Any sample that results  in a negative  test result must be destroyed.  Any sample 
40 that results in a postive positive  test result must be sent to a qualified testing 
41 laboratory consistent with subsections  6 to 8 for  confirmation  testing.
42 C.  A person  who performs a point of collection screening test or a confirmation test 
43 may release the results of that test  only as follows.
Page 51 - 128LR2886(01)-11 (1)  For a point of collection screening test that results in a preliminary positive 
2 or negative  test result,  the person performing the test shall release the test result 
3 to the employee who is the subject of the test immediately.
4 (2)  For a point of collection screening test that results in a preliminary positive 
5 test result,  the person performing the test may not release the test result to the 
6 employer until after  the result of the confirmation test has  been  determined.
7 (3)  For a point of collection screening test that results  in a preliminary  negative  
8 test result,  the person performing the test may not release the test result to the 
9 employer until after the result of a confirmation test would have been determined 
10 if one had been performed.
11 (4)  For a confirmation  test, the person performing  the test shall release the result 
12 immediately to the employee who is the  subject of the test  and to the employer.
13 6.  Qualified testing laboratories  required.   No An employer may not perform any 
14 substance abuse use test administered to any of that employer's employees.   An employer 
15 may perform  screening  tests administered to applicants  if the employer's testing facilities  
16 comply with the requirements for testing laboratories under this subsection.   Except as 
17 provided in subsection 5-A, any substance abuse use test administered under  this 
18 subchapter must be performed in a qualified  testing laboratory that complies with this 
19 subsection.
20 B.  The laboratory must  have written testing  procedures and procedures to ensure a 
21 clear chain  of custody.
22 C.  The laboratory  must demonstrate satisfactory performance in the proficiency  
23 testing program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the College  of American 
24 Pathology or the American  Association for Clinical Chemistry.
25 D.  The laboratory  must comply with rules adopted by the Department of Health  and 
26 Human Services under section 687.  These rules  shall  must ensure  that:
27 (1)  The laboratory  possesses  all licenses or certifications that the department 
28 finds necessary or desirable  to ensure reliable and  accurate test results;
29 (2)  The laboratory follows proper quality  control procedures, including, but not 
30 limited to:
31 (a)  The use of internal quality controls  during each substance abuse use test 
32 conducted under this subchapter, including  the use of blind samples and 
33 samples of known concentrations  which  that are used to check the 
34 performance and calibration  of testing equipment;
35 (b)  The internal  review and certification process for test results, including 
36 the qualifications of the person who performs  that function in the testing 
37 laboratory; and
38 (c)  Security measures  implemented by the testing laboratory; and
39 (3)  Other necessary  and proper  actions  are taken to ensure reliable and accurate 
40 test results.
Page 52 - 128LR2886(01)-11 7.  Testing procedure.  A testing laboratory shall perform a screening test on each 
2 sample submitted  by the employer for only those substances  of abuse that the employer 
3 requests to be identified.  If a screening test result is negative, no further  test may be 
4 conducted on that sample.   If a screening test result is positive, a confirmation test shall 
5 must be performed on that sample.   A testing laboratory shall  retain all confirmed 
6 positive samples  for one year in a manner  that will inhibit deterioration of the samples  
7 and allow  subsequent retesting.  All other samples shall  must  be disposed of immediately 
8 after testing.
9 8.  Laboratory report of test results.   This subsection governs the reporting  of test 
10 results.
11 A.  A laboratory report of  test results shall must, at a minimum, state:
12 (1)  The name of the  laboratory that  performed the test or tests;
13 (2)  Any confirmed positive results on any tested  sample.
14 (a)  Unless the employee  or applicant consents, test results shall may not be 
15 reported in numerical or quantitative  form but shall must state only that the 
16 test result was positive or negative.  This division does not apply  if the test or 
17 the test results become the subject of any grievance procedure, administrative 
18 proceeding or civil action.
19 (b)  A testing laboratory and the employer must shall ensure that an 
20 employee's unconfirmed positive screening test result cannot be determined 
21 by the employer in any manner, including, but not limited to, the method  of 
22 billing the employer for the tests performed by the laboratory and the time 
23 within which results are provided to the employer.  This division does not 
24 apply to test  results for  applicants;
25 (3)  The sensitivity or cutoff level  of the confirmation  test; and
26 (4)  Any available information concerning the margin  of accuracy  and precision 
27 of the test methods employed.
28 The report shall  may not disclose the presence or absence of evidence of any physical  
29 or mental condition or of any substance other than the specific substances  of abuse  
30 that the employer requested to be identified.  A testing laboratory shall  retain records 
31 of confirmed  positive results in a numerical or quantitative form  for at  least 2 years.
32 B.  The employer shall promptly notify  the employee or applicant tested  of the test 
33 result.  Upon request of an employee or applicant, the employer shall promptly 
34 provide a legible copy of the laboratory report to the employee or applicant.  Within 3 
35 working days after notice of a confirmed  positive test result, the employee or 
36 applicant may submit information to the employer  explaining or contesting  the 
37 results.
38 C.  The testing  laboratory  shall send test reports for samples segregated at an 
39 employee's or applicant's  request under subsection  5, paragraph A, to both the 
40 employer and the employee or applicant tested.
Page 53 - 128LR2886(01)-11 D.  Every employer  whose policy is approved by the Department of Labor under 
2 section 686 shall annually send to the department a compilation of the results of all 
3 substance abuse use tests administered by that employer in the previous calendar 
4 year.  This report shall must provide separate  categories  for employees and applicants 
5 and shall  must be presented  in statistical form so that no person  who was tested by 
6 that employer can be identified from the report.  The report shall must include  a 
7 separate category  for any tests conducted on a random or arbitrary basis under section  
8 684, subsection 3.
9 9.  Costs.  The employer shall  pay the costs of all substance abuse  use tests which 
10 that the employer requires, requests or suggests  that an employee or applicant submit.  
11 Except as provided in paragraph A, the employee or applicant shall pay the costs of any 
12 additional substance abuse  use tests.
13 Costs of a substance abuse use test administered at the request  of an employee under  
14 subsection 5, paragraph  B, shall must be paid:
15 A.  By the employer  if the test results  are negative for all substances  of abuse  tested  
16 for in the sample; and
17 B.  By the employee if the test results in a confirmed  positive  result for any of the 
18 substances of abuse tested  for in the sample.
19 10.  Limitation on use of tests.  An employer may administer substance abuse use 
20 tests to employees or applicants  only for the purpose of discovering  the use of any 
21 substance of abuse likely to cause impairment of the user or the use of any scheduled 
22 drug.  No An employer may not have substance abuse use tests administered to an 
23 employee or  applicant for the purpose  of discovering any  other  information.
24 11.  Rules.  The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt  any rules  
25 under section 687 regulating substance abuse use testing procedures that it finds 
26 necessary or desirable to ensure accurate and reliable substance  abuse use testing and to 
27 protect the privacy  rights of employees  and applicants.
28 Sec. A-105.  26 MRSA §684, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §2, is further 
29 amended to read:
30 §684.  Imposition of tests
31 1.  Testing  of applicants.  An employer  may require, request or suggest that an 
32 applicant submit to a  substance  abuse use  test only if:
33 A.  The  applicant has been offered employment with the employer; or
34 B.  The applicant has been offered  a position on a roster of eligibility  from  which  
35 applicants will be selected for employment.  The number of persons on this roster of 
36 eligibility may not exceed the number  of applicants hired by that employer  in the 
37 preceding 6 months.
38 The offer of employment or offer  of a position on a roster of eligibility may be 
39 conditioned on the applicant  receiving a negative  test result.
Page 54 - 128LR2886(01)-11 2.  Probable  cause  testing of employees.  An employer may require, request  or 
2 suggest that an employee submit to a substance abuse use test if the employer has 
3 probable cause to test  the employee.
4 A.  The employee's  immediate supervisor,  other supervisory personnel,  a licensed  
5 physician or nurse, or the employer's security personnel  shall must make the 
6 determination of probable cause.
7 B.  The supervisor or other  person must  state,  in writing, the facts upon which this the 
8 determination made under  paragraph A is based and provide a copy of the statement  
9 to the employee.
10 3.  Random or arbitrary testing of employees.  In addition to testing employees  on 
11 a probable cause basis under  subsection 2, an employer may require, request or suggest 
12 that an employee  submit to a  substance abuse use  test on a  random or arbitrary basis if:
13 A.  The employer and the employee have bargained for provisions in a collective 
14 bargaining agreement, either before or after the effective date of this subchapter, that 
15 provide for random or arbitrary testing of employees.   A random  or arbitrary testing 
16 program that would result from implementation  of an employer's last best offer is not 
17 considered a provision bargained for in a collective bargaining  agreement for 
18 purposes of  this section;
19 B.  The employee works in a position the nature  of which  would create an 
20 unreasonable threat to the health or safety of the public  or the employee's coworkers 
21 if the employee were under the influence  of a substance of abuse .  It is the intent of 
22 the Legislature that the  requirements of this paragraph be narrowly construed;  or
23 C.  The employer has established a random  or arbitrary testing program  under this 
24 paragraph that applies to all employees, except as provided in subparagraph (4), 
25 regardless of  position.
26 (1)  An employer may establish a testing program under this paragraph only if the 
27 employer has 50 or more employees  who are not covered  by a collective 
28 bargaining agreement.
29 (2)  The written policy  required by section 683, subsection 2 with respect to a 
30 testing program  under this paragraph must be developed  by a committee  of at 
31 least 10 of the employer's employees.   The employer shall appoint members  to 
32 the committee  from  a cross-section of employees who are eligible  to be tested.   
33 The committee must  include a medical  professional who is trained  in procedures 
34 for testing for substances of abuse.  If no such person is employed  by the 
35 employer, the employer  shall obtain  the services  of such a person to serve as a 
36 member of  the committee created under  this subparagraph.
37 (3)  The written policy developed under subparagraph (2) must  also require that 
38 selection of employees for testing be performed by a person or entity not subject  
39 to the employer's influence,  such as a medical review officer.  Selection  must be 
40 made from a list, provided  by the employer,  of all employees subject  to testing 
41 under this paragraph. The list may not contain information  that would identify  the 
42 employee to the person  or entity making the selection.
Page 55 - 128LR2886(01)-11 (4)  Employees who are covered by a collective  bargaining agreement are not 
2 included in testing programs  pursuant to this paragraph unless they agree to be 
3 included pursuant to a collective  bargaining  agreement as described under 
4 paragraph A.
5 (5)  Before initiating a testing program under this paragraph, the employer  must  
6 shall obtain from  the Department of Labor approval  of the policy developed by 
7 the employee  committee,  as required in section 686.  If the employer does not 
8 approve of the written  policy developed  by the employee  committee,  the 
9 employer may decide not to submit the policy  to the department  and not to 
10 establish the testing  program.  The employer may not change the written policy 
11 without approval of the  employee committee.
12 (6)  The employer may not discharge, suspend, demote, discipline or otherwise  
13 discriminate with regard to compensation or working conditions against an 
14 employee for participating or refusing to participate  in an employee committee  
15 created pursuant to this  paragraph.
16 4.  Testing while undergoing rehabilitation or treatment.  While the employee is 
17 participating in a substance  abuse use rehabilitation program either as a result of 
18 voluntary contact  with or mandatory  referral  to the employer's employee assistance 
19 program or after a confirmed positive result  as provided in section 685, subsection 2, 
20 paragraphs B and C, substance  abuse use testing may be conducted by the rehabilitation 
21 or treatment  provider as required, requested or suggested by that provider.
22 A.  Substance abuse use testing conducted as part of such a rehabilitation or treatment 
23 program is not subject  to the provisions of this subchapter regulating substance abuse 
24 use testing.
25 B.  An employer may not require, request or suggest that any substance abuse use test 
26 be administered to any employee while the employee is undergoing such 
27 rehabilitation or treatment, except as provided in subsections 2 and 3.
28 C.  The results of any substance abuse use test administered to an employee as part of 
29 such a rehabilitation or treatment program may not be released to the employer.
30 5.  Testing upon  return to work.  If an employee  who has received a confirmed 
31 positive result returns to work with the same employer, whether or not the employee has 
32 participated in a rehabilitation program under  section 685, subsection 2, the employer 
33 may require, request  or suggest  that the employee submit to a subsequent substance  abuse  
34 use test anytime  between  90 days and one year after the date of the employee's  prior test.  
35 A test may be administered  under this subsection in addition to any tests conducted under  
36 subsections 2 and 3.  An employer may require,  request  or suggest that an employee 
37 submit to a substance abuse  use test during the first 90 days after the date of the 
38 employee's prior test only as provided in subsections 2 and  3.
39 Sec. A-106.  26 MRSA §685, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §3, is further 
40 amended to read:
Page 56 - 128LR2886(01)-11 §685.  Action  taken on substance  use tests
2 Action taken by an employer on the basis of a substance abuse  use test is limited as 
3 provided in this section.
4 1.  Before receipt  of test results.  An employer may suspend an employee with full 
5 pay and benefits  or may transfer the employee  to another position with no reduction in 
6 pay or benefits while awaiting an employee's test results.
7 2.  Use of confirmation test results.   This subsection governs an employer's  use of 
8 confirmed positive results and an employee's  or applicant's  refusal  to submit to a test 
9 requested or  required by an  employer in compliance with this subchapter.
10 A.  Subject to any limitation  of the Maine Human Rights  Act or any other  state law or 
11 federal law, an employer may use a confirmed positive result or refusal to submit to a 
12 test as a factor in any of the following decisions:
13 (1)  Refusal to hire an applicant for employment or refusal to place an applicant 
14 on a roster  of eligibility;
15 (2)  Discharge of an  employee;
16 (3)  Discipline of an  employee; or
17 (4)  Change in the employee's work assignment.
18 A-1.  An employer who tests a person  as an applicant  and employs that person prior 
19 to receiving  the test result  may take no action on a positive result except in 
20 accordance with the  employee  provisions  of the employer's approved policy.
21 B.  Before taking any action described in paragraph  A in the case of an employee 
22 who receives an initial confirmed positive result,  an employer shall  provide the 
23 employee with an opportunity to participate for up to 6 months in a rehabilitation  
24 program designed  to enable  the employee to avoid future use of a substance of abuse 
25 and to participate  in an employee assistance program, if the employer  has such a 
26 program.  The employer may take any action described in paragraph A if the 
27 employee receives a subsequent confirmed positive  result from a test administered by 
28 the employer under this subchapter.
29 C.  If the employee chooses not to participate in a rehabilitation program  under  this 
30 subsection, the employer  may take any action described in paragraph  A.  If the 
31 employee chooses to participate in a rehabilitation program, the following provisions 
32 apply.
33 (1)  If the employer has an employee assistance program that offers  counseling  or 
34 rehabilitation services, the employee may choose to enter that program at the 
35 employer's expense.   If these services are not available from an employer's 
36 employee assistance program  or if the employee chooses not to participate in that 
37 program, the employee may  enter a public or private  rehabilitation program.
38 (a)  Except to the extent that costs are covered  by a group health insurance 
39 plan, the costs of the public or private rehabilitation  program must be equally  
40 divided between the employer and employee if the employer  has more than 
Page 57 - 128LR2886(01)-11 20 full-time  employees.  This requirement does not apply to municipalities  or 
2 other political subdivisions  of the State or to any employer when the 
3 employee is tested because of the alcohol and controlled substance  testing 
4 mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation  Employee Testing Act of 
5 1991, Public Law 102-143, Title V.  If necessary, the employer shall assist in 
6 financing the cost share of the employee through  a payroll deduction plan.
7 (b)  Except to the extent that costs are covered  by a group health  insurance 
8 plan, an employer  with 20 or fewer  full-time employees, a municipality or 
9 other political subdivision  of the State  is not required to pay for any costs of 
10 rehabilitation or treatment  under any public or private rehabilitation program.  
11 An employer is not required to pay for the costs of rehabilitation  if the 
12 employee was tested  because  of the alcohol and controlled substance  testing 
13 mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation  Employee Testing Act of 
14 1991, Public Law 102-143,  Title V.
15 (2)  No An employer may not take any action described in paragraph A while an 
16 employee is participating  in a rehabilitation program, except as provided in 
17 subparagraph (2-A) and except that an employer may change  the employee's 
18 work assignment or suspend the employee from active duty to reduce  any 
19 possible safety hazard.  Except as provided in subparagraph  (2-A),  an employee's 
20 pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee  is participating in a 
21 rehabilitation program, provided that the employer is not required to pay the 
22 employee for periods  in which the employee is unavailable  for work  for the 
23 purposes of rehabilitation or while the employee is medically disqualified.   The 
24 employee may apply normal sick leave and vacation  time, if any, for these  
25 periods.
26 (2-A)  A rehabilitation  or treatment provider shall promptly  notify  the employer 
27 if the employee fails to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation  program before 
28 the expiration  of the 6-month  period  provided in paragraph B.  Upon receipt of 
29 this notice, the employer may take any action described  in paragraph A.
30 (3)  Except as provided  in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 
31 rehabilitation program, as determined by the rehabilitation or treatment provider 
32 after consultation with the employer,  the employee is entitled to return  to the 
33 employee's previous job with full pay and benefits unless conditions unrelated to 
34 the employee's previous confirmed positive result make the employee's return  
35 impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must may not conflict with any 
36 provision of a collective  bargaining agreement  between the employer  and a labor 
37 organization that is the collective bargaining  representative of the unit of which 
38 the employee  is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or treatment provider  
39 determines that the employee  has not successfully completed the rehabilitation  
40 program within  6 months  after starting the program, the employer may take any 
41 action described in paragraph  A.
42 (a)  If the employee  who has completed rehabilitation previously  worked in 
43 an employment position  subject to random  or arbitrary testing under an 
44 employer's written policy,  the employer may refuse to allow the employee to 
45 return to the previous job if the employer  believes that the employee may 
Page 58 - 128LR2886(01)-11 pose an unreasonable safety hazard because of the nature  of the position.  The  
2 employer shall attempt to find suitable work  for the employee immediately  
3 after refusing  the employee's return to the previous position.  No A reduction 
4 may not be made in the employee's previous benefits or rate of pay while the 
5 employee is awaiting reassignment  to work  or while working in a position  
6 other than the previous  job.  The employee shall must  be reinstated to the 
7 previous position or to another position  with an equivalent rate of pay and 
8 benefits and with no loss of seniority within 6 months after returning  to work 
9 in any capacity with the employer unless the employee  has received a 
10 subsequent confirmed positive result within that time from a test 
11 administered under this subchapter  or unless conditions unrelated to the 
12 employee's previous  confirmed positive test result  make that reinstatement  or 
13 reassignment impossible.  Placement of the employee in suitable work and 
14 reinstatement may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining  
15 agreement between the employer  and a labor organization that is the 
16 collective bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or 
17 would be a part.
18 (b)  Notwithstanding division  (a), if an employee who has successfully  
19 completed rehabilitation  is medically  disqualified, the employer is not 
20 required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 
21 during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not required to 
22 compensate the employee during the period  of disqualification.  Immediately 
23 after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 
24 obligations under division (a) attach as if the employee  had successfully 
25 completed rehabilitation on that date.
26 D.  This subsection does not require an employer to take any disciplinary action 
27 against an employee who refuses  to submit  to a test, receives a single  or repeated 
28 confirmed positive result or does not choose to participate in a rehabilitation program.   
29 This subsection  is intended  to set minimum  opportunities for an employee with a 
30 substance abuse use problem to address the problem through rehabilitation.  An 
31 employer may offer  additional opportunities, not otherwise in violation  of this 
32 subchapter, for rehabilitation  or continued employment without rehabilitation.
33 3.  Confidentiality.  This subsection governs the use of information  acquired by an 
34 employer in the  testing process.
35 A.  Unless the employee  or applicant consents, all information acquired by an 
36 employer in the testing process is confidential  and may not be released to any person  
37 other than the employee or applicant who is tested, any necessary personnel of the 
38 employer and a provider of rehabilitation or treatment services under subsection  2, 
39 paragraph C.   This paragraph  does not prevent:
40 (1) The release of this information  when required or permitted by state or federal  
41 law, including release under  section  683, subsection 8, paragraph D; or
42 (2)  The use of this information in any grievance procedure, administrative 
43 hearing or civil action relating to the imposition of the test or the use of test 
44 results.
Page 59 - 128LR2886(01)-11 B.  Notwithstanding any other law, the results of any substance abuse use test 
2 required, requested  or suggested by any employer may not be used in any criminal 
3 proceeding.
