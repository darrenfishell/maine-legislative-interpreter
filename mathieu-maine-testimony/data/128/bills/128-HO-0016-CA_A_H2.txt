9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.O. 16, Order, "House Order, To Amend 
10 House Rules Concerning Absence Due to Major Illness or Injury" 
11 Amend the House Order in the first Ordered paragraph in the first 2 lines by striking 
12 out the following: "adding a new subsection 14" and inserting the following: 'amending 
13 subsection 12' 
14 Amend the House Order by striking out all of subsection 14 and inserting the 
15 following: 
16 '12. Voting. A member who is in the House when a question is put shall vote, unless 
17 the presiding officer for reasons excuses that member. When yeas and nays are ordered, a 
18 member may not leave the member's seat until the vote is declared. A call for yeas and 
19 nays must close no more than 30 minutes after a roll call is commenced. In all elections 
20 by the House, or on joint ballot of the Chambers, a member may not leave the member's 
21 seat after voting, before a return of the House is had. A member may not vote on any 
22 question before the House when that question immediately involves that member's private 
23 right as distinct from the public interest. With approval from the Speaker upon as prompt 
24 notice as possible from the member, a member is excused from house deliberations and 
25 roll calls for a debilitating or incapacitating major illness or injury; the member must 
26 contact the Speaker and Clerk upon return.' 
27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment strikes the proposed change to House Rule 401 that requires the 
29 Clerk in calculating a member's voting percentage to disregard absences due to major 
30 illness and injury and replaces it with language added to House Rule 401, subsection 12 
31 allowing the Speaker to excuse a member from House deliberations and roll calls for a 
32 debilitating or incapacitating major illness or injury.
