The requirement that a caregiver who will have a person who is enrolled in a primary or secondary school as a 
qualifying patient submit to the criminal history record check pursuant to Title 20-A, section 6103 and section 13011 
may result in increased costs to the Department of Public Safety associated with performing the criminal history 
record check. The cost can not be determined at this time but is expected to be minor. Additional dedicated revenues 
received by the Department of Public Safety from a portion of the fees assessed as part of the criminal history record 
check are also expected to be minor. The total fee assessed for each record check is $70, of which the Department of 
Public Safety receives $55 and the General Fund receives $15.
