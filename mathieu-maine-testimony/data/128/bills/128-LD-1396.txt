This bill amends the provisions of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System 12 
regarding compensation and servic e retirement benefits for retired state employees and 13 
retired teachers who return to service as classroom -based employees or school 14 
administrators in the following ways.  15 
1.  It allows a retired state employee or retired teacher to be restored to service as  a 16 
classroom -based employee or school administrator beyond the current 5 -year limit.  17 
2.  It removes the cap of 75% of compensation established for the position that the 18

3.  It allows a retired state employee or  retired teacher who returns to service as a 20 
classroom -based employee or school administrator to receive full retirement, health, 21 
dental and life insurance benefits as offered for the position to be filled and suspends the 22 
provisions of retiree health, den tal and life insurance benefits for retired state employees 23 
or retired teachers during the period of reemployment.  24 
4.  It retains the current provisions that a retired state employee or retired teacher who 25 
returns to service is not a member and therefore m ay not accrue additional creditable 26 
service or change the retired state employee's or retired teacher's earnable compensation 27 
for benefit calculation purposes.  28 
5.  It requires full employee and employer contributions to the retirement system for 29 
the unfund ed liability and the state group health plan for retiree health care based upon 30 
the retired state employee's or retired teacher's compensation.  31
