Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would include 50 milliliter and smaller wine or spirits bottles in the state bottle redemption program starting 
January 1, 2019. Because the bottle redemption program is included in the spirits administration contract with Pine State 
Trading Company, this change would require the contract be renegotiated. The spirits contract vendor would be required 
to affix redemption stickers to existing inventory in stock and all future inventory of product if producers choose not to 
modify their product labels to include redemption information. New packaging equipment would require an 8 to 12 
month lead time for the vendor to order, have manufactured and accept delivery. The equipment purchase will require a 
one time allocation of $580,000 in fiscal year 2017-18. The bill includes an allocation $862,763 in fiscal year 2018-19 
for additional payments to redemption centers, recycling centers, Pine State's labor and equipment needed to perf01m the 
new labeling requirements and a one-time allowance for fraudulently or mistakenly redeemed containers. It is anticipated 
that the Alcoholic Beverages Fund will have sufficient revenue to fund the additional allocation for the foreseeable 
future. However, the additional expenditures from the fund may put required future payments to the Maine Municipal 
Bond Bank at risk. 
The Department of Environmental Protection estimates that an additional 320 products would be subject to the rules 
clarifying the responsibilities of manufacturers, dealers, distributors, initiators of deposit, contracted agents and 
redemption centers under the Returnable Beverage Container Law. Each beverage container and label must be registered 
with the department prior to being offered for sale in the State. Registration is $4 per label, which would increase Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue by $1,280 annually beginning in fiscal year 2018-19.
