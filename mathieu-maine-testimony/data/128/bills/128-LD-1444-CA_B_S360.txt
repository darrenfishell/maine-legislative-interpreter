a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
utilities and energy matters that includes the results of this proceeding. The Public 
Utilities Commission shall also explore rate design options that would be in the best 
interest of ratepayers and support the long-term, sustainable development of distributed 
generation. 
Sec. 5. Rules. The Public Utilities Commission shall amend its net energy billing 
rules to be consistent with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A by 
September 1, 2018. The Public Utilities Commission shall adopt rules pursuant to Title

SUMMARY 
Thls amendment is the minority report of the committee, and it replaces the bill and 
changes the title. It does the following regarding net energy billing. 
1. It allows an eligible customer to elect net energy billing until December 31, 2018, 
after which time no new net energy billing arrangements may be allowed. 
2. It allows net energy billing arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2019 to 
remain in effect until December 31, 2033. 
3. It prohlbits a transmission and distribution utility from requiring a customer to 
meter the gross output of an eligible facility in order to participate in net energy billing. 
4. It limits to 50 the number of eligible customers that may participate in a single 
shared interest in an eligible facility or the number of meters associated with a single 
shared interest, except in the service territory of a transmission and distribution utility 
located in an area administered by the independent system administrator for northern 
Maine. 
The amendment establishes a market-based crediting system for energy generated by 
eligible facilities. It requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules to allow an 
eligible customer to receive a monetary credit for energy generated by an eligible facility 
in excess of the customer's usage and exported to the grid at the real-time wholesale 
market price of that energy. As in the provisions relating to net energy billing, a 
transmission and distribution utility is prohibited from requiring a customer to meter the 
gross output of an eligible facility in order to participate in the crediting system, and the 
number of eligible customers that may participate in a single shared interest in an eligible 
facility, or the number of meters associated with a single shared interest, is limited to 50. 
The amendment exempts a transmission and distribution utility located in an area 
administered by the independent system administrator for northern Maine, or any 
successor of the independent system administrator for northern Maine, from using thls 
crediting system until the Public Utilities Commission determines the utility1s billing 
system can perform the necessary functions to implement the system. It requires the 
commission to consider whether an alternative system to the crediting system for northern 
Maine could be developed and utilized in the interim period before the utility1s billing 
system is modified to allow a market-based crediting system.
