board must use the most recent address on file for that applicant or licensee. If the 
applicant or licensee would like to review the redacted file before it is made publicly 
available, the applicant or licensee must notify the board within 10 business days. If 
requested by the applicant or licensee, the board must send a .copy of the redacted file to 
the applicant or licensee, and the applicant or licensee has 10 business days from when
