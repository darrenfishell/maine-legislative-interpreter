Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill prohibits health insurance carriers from denying coverage for services delivered in a school setting under a 
contract with a federally qualified health center if the same services would be covered if provided at the federally 
qualified health center. This could potentially impact the State Employee Health Plan, as claims for services in school­
based health centers may increase. The potential cost of the increased coverage cannot be estimated at this time.
