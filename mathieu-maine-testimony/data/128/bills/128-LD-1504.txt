designated pursuant to subsection 1 shall implement a transparent me chanism to track and 8 
recover or distribute the eligible costs and benefits from procuring the output of 9 
distributed generation resources pursuant to this chapter.  These eligible costs and 10 
benefits must be reviewed by the commission annually and allocated to and recovered 11 
from customers through a process established by the commission by rule.  The process 12 
developed by the commission must be similar to the allocation of costs and benefits of 13 
long-term energy contracts in section 3210 -F.  Eligible costs and b enefits include:  14 
A.  Incremental costs of serving as the standard buyer;  15 
B.  All payments to customers, subscribers and project sponsors under each 16 
procurement pursuant to section 3476; and  17 
C.  All revenue from sale of the output of distributed generation resources procured 18 
pursuant to this chapter.  19 
4.  Rules.   The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section.  The 20 
commission shall ensure that the rules provide opportunities for entities other than the 21 
standard buyer to aggregate and sell the out put of distributed generation resources in the 22 
applicable markets.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules 23 
as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 24 
§3476.  Large -scale commercial, municipal, industrial solar procur ement  25 
1.  Procurement.  The commission shall conduct competitive solicitations twice per 26 
year for long -term contracts for the output of a total of 50 megawatts of large -scale 27 
commercial solar distributed generation resources by December 31, 2022, referred to in 28 
this section as the "procurement target."  In each calendar year, the commission shall seek 29 
to procure approximately 10 megawatts of output through 2 separate solicitations, except 30 
that the commission may modify this annual procurement if it conclude s that doing so 31 
would be in the best interests of all ratepayers.  Prior to a solicitation, the commission 32 
shall develop, in consultation with the standard buyer, a standard contract that commits 33 
all parties to commercially reasonable behavior and includes  provisions to ensure that 34 
projects proceed to commercial operation on a reasonable timeline.  35 
2.  Bidder eligibility.  The commission may establish minimum requirements for 36 
bidders in a solicitation under subsection 1, including but not limited to site con trol, 37 
development experience, completion of an interconnection application and provision of 38 
system details.  The commission may by rule require bidders to pay an application fee to 39 
defray administrative costs.  40 
 
 Page 4 - 128LR1367(01) -1 
 3.  Ensuring competition.  Prior to each solic itation under subsection 1, the 1 
commission shall establish standards to determine whether the solicitation has a sufficient 2 
number of unique bidders and quantity of offered capacity to be competitive.  If the 3 
commission concludes based on the standards tha t a solicitation is not competitive, no 4 
bidders may be selected and the capacity available in that solicitation must be deferred to 5 
a subsequent solicitation.  The commission may by rule adjust the maximum size of a 6 
large -scale commercial solar distributed  generation resource eligible for a solicitation to 7 
ensure that there is more than one bid selected.  8 
4.  Bid enhancement.  In reviewing bids, the commission shall give preference to 9 
solar projects associated with affordable multifamily housing.  Bids for a  solar project 10 
associated with affordable multifamily housing must be reviewed by the commission at a 11 
rate that is 1¢ per kilowatt -hour less than the actual bid submitted.  For the purpose of 12 
calculating that contract rate, a solar project associated with affordable multifamily 13 
housing that is awarded a contract must be paid at the actual bid rate and not the bid rate 14 
used for review.  15 
5.  Bid selection.  Following review of bids in a solicitation under subsection 1, if the 16 
commission determines that the sol icitation is competitive, the commission shall select 17 
one or more winning bidders and direct the standard buyer to negotiate and enter into a 18 
contract with the winning bidder or bidders for a term of 20 years at a specified contract 19 
rate.  The commission s hall select bids that maximize benefits or minimize costs to all 20 
ratepayers.  21 
6.  Agricultural or forest products business target.  The commission shall seek to 22 
procure 8 megawatts of the 50 -megawatt procurement target under subsection 1 from 23 
solar projects  associated with an agricultural or forest products business.  The 24 
commission shall monitor winning bids to determine progress toward this target.  If, by 25 
December 31, 2019, the commission determines that the solicitations under this section 26 
are not likely  to result in the procurement of 8 megawatts of solar projects associated with 27 
an agricultural or forest products business by 2022, the commission shall review bids for 28 
a solar project associated with an agricultural or forest products business at a rate t hat is 29 
1¢ per kilowatt -hour less than the actual bid submitted.  For the purpose of calculating 30 
that contract rate, a solar project associated with an agricultural or forest products 31 
business that is awarded a contract must be paid at the actual bid rate a nd not the bid rate 32 
used for review.  33 
7.  Determination of bill credit.  The bill credit to be allocated to a customer must 34 
be based on the total kilowatt -hours of energy production of the solar distributed 35 
generation resource for the previous month.  Each billing month, the value of the credits 36 
must be calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt -hours by the contract rate.  37 
Payments to subscribers must be credited against the subscriber's monthly electricity bill 38 
in accordance with section 3478.  39 
The mo nthly production must be determined by a revenue -grade meter installed and paid 40 
for by the participating large -scale commercial solar distributed generation resource 41 
customer account holder.  42 
 
 Page 5 - 128LR1367(01) -1 
 8.  Exemption.  A customer is not considered a public utility or competitive 1 
electricity supplier solely as a result of entering into a contract with the standard buyer 2 
under this section.  3 
9.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 4 
adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine techn ical rules as defined in Title 5, 5 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 6 
§3477.  Small business distributed generation credit rate program  7 
The small business distributed generation credit rate program, referred to in this 8 
section as "the program," is established as an alternative to net energy billing.  9 
1.  Eligibility.  Nonresidential customers are eligible for a small business distributed 10 
generation credit rate as an alternative to net energy billing pursuant to section 3209 -A. 11 
2.  Long -term contracts.  The standard  buyer shall enter into a contract with eligible 12 
small business customers for the energy and capacity of a distributed generation resource 13 
with a capacity of between 25 and 250 kilowatts for a term of 20 years.  The rate paid for 14 
the energy and capacity mu st be set by the commission in accordance with subsection 3.  15 
Payments to customers under a contract under this section must be credited against the 16 
customer's monthly electricity bill in accordance with section 3478.  17 
3.  Rates.  The commission shall estab lish a small business credit rate to be paid for 18 
the energy and capacity of a distributed generation resource.  By December 1st of each 19 
year the program is in effect, the commission shall set the small business credit rate for 20 
new program participants in t he following calendar year equal to the average over the 21 
past 12 months of total volumetric rates, including, but not limited to, the rate for 22 
standard offer service paid by the nonresidential rate class with the lowest annual peak 23 
demand.  The commission shall establish a separate small business credit rate for each 24 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility service territory in the State.  New 25 
program participants receive the fixed small business credit rate in effect at the time they 26 
begin part icipation in the program for the term of the contract in subsection 2.  27 
4.  Self-consumption.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, an eligible small business 28 
customer may offset that customer's own consumption using that customer's distributed 29 
generation resource . 30 
5.  Net energy billing option. After the effective date of rules adopted under 31 
subsection 7, an eligible customer may elect to either participate in net energy billing 32 
pursuant to section 3209 -A or enter into a contract under subsection 2.  If a customer  33 
elects to enter into a contract, that customer may not subsequently participate in net 34 
energy billing during the time period covered by the contract.  If a customer elects to 35 
participate in net energy billing, the customer may change the customer's bill c redit to a 36 
contract under subsection 2 within 12 months of the execution of a net energy billing 37 
agreement with a transmission and distribution utility.  38 
6.  Consumer -owned utility exemption.  This section does not apply to a consumer - 39 
owned transmission an d distribution utility or its customers.  40 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR1367(01) -1 
 7.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section.  Rules 1 
adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 2 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 3 
8.  Program review.  The commission shall evaluate how effective the program is at 4 
increasing installations of distributed generation resources and the program's expected 5 
short -term and long -term effect on ratepayers.  After completing its final evaluation, the 6 
commission sha ll determine whether or not to continue the program for new participants 7 
until such time it determines the program is no longer effective or it does not result in 8 
benefits to ratepayers.  The commission shall submit a report by December 31, 2020 or 9 
when co ntracts under the program total 20 megawatts, whichever comes first, and by 10 
December 31, 2021 or when contracts under the program total 30 megawatts, whichever 11 
comes first, to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 12 
utiliti es and energy matters.  The report must include the commission's findings along 13 
with any recommendations for program modification.  The joint standing committee of 14 
the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters may report out a bill 15 
relating to the program to the First Regular Session of the 130th Legislature and may also 16 
report out a bill relating to the program to the Second Regular Session of the 130th 17 
Legislature.  18 
§3478.  Bill credits  19 
This section applies to any credits assigned t o a customer's bill under this chapter.  20 
If the value of the credit to be applied to a customer's bill is less than the amount 21 
owed by the customer at the end of the applicable billing period, the customer must be 22 
billed for the difference between the amoun t shown on the bill and the value of the 23 
available credits.  24 
If the value of the credits to be applied to a customer's bill is greater than the amount 25 
owed by the customer at the end of the applicable billing period, the remaining value of 26 
the credit must c arry over from month to month until a specified date each year.  The 27 
commission shall establish a minimum of 2 standard credit expiration dates that provide 28 
customers the opportunity to use bill credits to the maximum extent practicable in a given 29 
12-month  period.  Any remaining credits as of that date must be credited to the standard 30 
buyer and may not be applied against any future customer bill.  31 
Sec. 4.  Rules.  The Public Utilities Commission shall adopt rules by January 1, 32 
2018 to implement the Maine Rev ised Statutes, Title 35 -A, sections 3475 to 3478.  33 
Sec. 5.  Net energy billing rules.  The commission shall amend its net energy 34 
billing rules adopted pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, section 3209 -A 35 
to be substantively equivalent to the r ules in effect on January 1, 2017, except the rules 36 
must be consistent with Title 35 -A, section 3209 -A, subsection 1.  Notwithstanding Title 37 
35-A, section 3209 -A, subsection 2, rules adopted for this purpose are routine technical 38 
rules, as defined in Title  5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 39 
Sec. 6.  Net energy billing analysis.  The Public Utilities Commission shall 40 
conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits to ratepayers from net energy billing.  The 41 
 
 Page 7 - 128LR1367(01) -1 
 analysis must include all identifiable costs and benefit s for net energy billing participants 1 
and nonparticipants, including but not limited to the costs and benefits described in Public 2 
Law 2013, chapter 562, section 2.  The analysis must at a minimum look at costs and 3 
benefits over a 10 -year period and a 25 -year period.  Where uncertainty exists with regard 4 
to a future cost or benefit, the commission shall use assumptions for what it considers the 5 
most likely higher and lower value scenarios.  The commission shall submit a report by 6 
December 31, 2019 and anoth er report by December 31, 2020 to the joint standing 7 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters.  The 8 
commission shall submit with the December 31, 2019 report information regarding any 9 
programs the commission is con ducting and recommendations regarding alternatives to 10 
net energy billing that would encourage distributed energy resource projects.  The 11 
commission shall submit with the December 31, 2020 report recommendations regarding 12 
net energy billing based on the cos ts and benefits analysis including methods for 13 
encouraging and integrating distributed energy resources to increase efficiency of the 14 
electric grid while reducing costs.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, rate 15 
design and time of use rates, direc t deployment of aggregated solar and storage systems, 16 
distributed energy rates or changes to transmission and distribution system planning.  In 17 
developing these reports, the commission shall consult with stakeholders that include, but 18 
are not limited to, t ransmission and distribution utilities, consumer advocates, distributed 19 
energy installers or suppliers, conservation organizations and experts in rate design.  At 20 
least 60 days before submitting the December 31, 2019 report and the December 31, 2020 21 
report  to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities 22 
and energy matters, the commission shall post the reports on its publicly accessible 23 
website.  Within that period of time, a member of the public may submit to the 24 
commi ssion written comments regarding the report.  The commission shall submit all 25 
comments received to the committee with the report.  The joint standing committee of the 26 
Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters may report out a bill 27 
relating to the December 31, 2020 report.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill amends the law regarding net energy billing and makes the adoption of net 30 
energy billing rules major substantive instead of routine technical, except that rules 31 
adopted to be consistent with the ch anges in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, 32 
section 3209 -A, subsection 1, substantively equivalent to the rules in effect prior to 33 
March 29, 2017 and that must be completed by December 1, 2017, are routine technical 34 
rules.  35 
The bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to enter into long -term contracts with 36 
a duration of 20 years for the procurement of 50 megawatts of large -scale commercial 37 
solar distributed generation resources by 2022.  The bill requires that 8 megawatts of the 38 
50-megawatt procurem ent target be from large commercial solar distributed generation 39 
resources for projects associated with an agricultural or forest products business.  40 
The bill creates a standard buyer, which the bill specifies is the investor -owned 41 
transmission and distribu tion utility in its service territory.  The bill allows the 42 
commission to designate another entity as the standard buyer if it determines it is in the 43 
best interest of ratepayers to do so.  The purpose of the standard buyer is to purchase the 44 
 
 Page 8 - 128LR1367(01) -1 
 output of eac h category of distributed generation resource, aggregate the portfolio of 1 
distributed generation resources procured and sell or use the output of these resources in a 2 
manner that maximizes the value of this portfolio of resources to all ratepayers.  3 
The bil l directs the commission to conduct competitive solicitations for 20% of the 5 - 4 
year target procurement for long -term contracts for the output of large -scale commercial 5 
solar distributed generation resources twice per year.  The bill directs the commission and 6 
standard buyer to develop a contract prior to a solicitation that will ensure that projects 7 
proceed to commercial operation on a reasonable timeline and commits all parties to 8 
commercially reasonable behavior.  9 
The bill gives the commission authority to  establish requirements for bidder 10 
eligibility and standards to ensure competition in the bidding process.  The bill also 11 
specifies that if the solicitation is fully competitive, the commission must select one or 12 
more winning bids and direct the standard b uyer to negotiate and enter into a contract 13 
with the winning bidder or bidders.  If the commission concludes the solicitation is not 14 
competitive, no bidders may be selected and the capacity available in that solicitation 15 
must be deferred to a subsequent so licitation.  The bill requires the commission to select 16 
bids that maximize the benefits or minimize the costs to all ratepayers.  17 
The bill directs the commission to give preference to projects associated with 18 
affordable multifamily housing.  The bill requir es the commission to review bids for 19 
projects associated with affordable multifamily housing at 1¢ less per kilowatt -hour than 20 
the actual bid, but if such a project is awarded a contract, it is paid at the actual bid rate 21 
and not the rate used for review.  This same process is allowed in the bill after December 22 
31, 2019 for projects associated with an agricultural or forest products business if the 23 
commission determines that solicitations are not likely to result in the procurement of 8 24 
megawatts of solar p rojects associated with an agricultural or forest products business by 25 
2022.  26 
The bill also includes a small business distributed generation credit rate program as 27 
an alternative to net energy billing for nonresidential customers.  28 
The bill includes language  on how bill credits are to be determined for a customer.  29 
The bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to adopt routine technical rules 30 
regarding the procurement of large -scale commercial solar distributed generation 31 
resources by January 1, 2018.  32 
The bill also requires the commission to submit multiple reports on the effectiveness 33 
of the bill credit program at increasing installations of distributed generation resources 34 
and its expected short -term and long -term effect on ratepayers, as well as multiple  reports 35 
regarding net energy billing and alternatives to net energy billing.  36
