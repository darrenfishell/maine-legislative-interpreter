SUMMARY  9 
This bill creates a new category of political party, defined as a "minor party," with a 10 
minimum of 5,000 and a maximum of 50,000 enrolled voters.  A party with more than 11 
50,000 enrolled voters is defined as a "major party" and nominates candidates through the 12 
primary election process.  Minor parties do not participate in primaries but instead 13 
nominate candidates at state conventions and are required to file consent forms an d 14 
statements of qualification for those candidates with the Secretary of State within 30 days 15 
of the convention or by August 8th of the election year, whichever first occurs.  The bill 16 
modifies the timeline and procedure for major and minor parties to qual ify and to retain 17 
qualified party status.  It includes an administrative process, similar to the existing one for 18 
candidate petition challenges, by which a party may challenge a determination by the 19 
Secretary of State that it has failed to qualify.   These  changes to the party qualification 20 
process are intended to address legal issues raised by the Libertarian Party of Maine in a 21 
lawsuit filed in 2016, Libertarian Party of Maine v. Dunlap , Docket No. 2:16 -cv-00002 - 22 
JAW, and addressed by the United States Dis trict Court in a preliminary injunction order 23 
issued on May 27, 2016.  24
