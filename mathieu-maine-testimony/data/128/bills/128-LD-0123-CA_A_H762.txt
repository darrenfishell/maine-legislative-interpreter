considered a family foster home by virtue of the parent's or guardian's execution of a 
power of attorney authorized by subsection 1 and is not subject to any laws regarding 
the licensure or regulation of family foster homes unless licensed as a family foster 
home. Nothing in this subsection disqualifies the agent from being or becoming a 
family foster home licensed by the State or prevents the placement of the minor in the 
agent's care if the minor enters state custody.

purpose is to provide free legal services or to provide hospital services, that is exempt

23 attorney. 
24 5. Disqualification of agent. An employee or volunteer for an organization 
25 described in subsection 4 may not further assist with a process that results in the 
26 completion of a power of attorney for the temporary care of a minor if the background

25 court in which the appointing instrument is filed and giving notice of the objection to the 
26 guardian and any other persons entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointment.

5 with the minor, including but not limited to failing to maintain regular contact 
6 with the minor for a length of time that evidences an intent to abandon the minor. 
7 3. Priority for appointment. If a guardian is appointed by a parent pursuant to 
8 section 5-202 and the appointment has not been prevented or terminated under section 
9 5-203, that appointee has priority for appointment. However, the court may proceed with 
10 another appointment upon a finding that the appointee under section 5-202 has failed to 
11 accept the appointment within 30 days after notice of the guardianship proceeding. 
12 4. Appointment of a guardian on an emergency basis. If the court finds that 
13 following the procedures of this Patt will likely result in substantial harm to a minor's 
14 health or safety and that no other person appears to have authority to act in the

16 the minor. The duration of the guardian's authority may not exceed 90 days, and the 
17 guardian may exercise only the powers specified in the order. Reasonable notice of the

23 is appointed without notice, notice of the appointment must be given within 48 hours 
24 after the appointment. The court shall schedule a hearing on the appointment of the 
25 guardian within 14 days but not less than 7 days after issuance of the order appointing the 
26 guardian, except that a parent may request that the hearing take place sooner. The 
27 petitioner bears the burden of proof on the appropriateness of the appointment pursuant to 
28 this section. 
29 5. Child support. When appointing a guardian, including on an emergency or 
30 interim basis, the court's order must indicate whether there are any support orders 
31 involving the child presently in effect through judicial or administrative proceedings and 
32 the effect of the guardianship appointment on the orders. The court shall consider 
33 whether to order a parent to pay child support to the guardian in accordance with Title 
34 19-A, Part 3. A guardian must be treated as a caretaker relative for computation of a 
35 parental support obligation pursuant to Title 19-A, section 2006, subsection 4. The comt 
36 may reserve the question of support or decline to issue an order if it determines that an 
3 7 order for support is not warranted at the time of the appointment. When the Department 
38 of Health and Human Services provides child support enforcement services, the 
39 Commissioner of Health and Human Services may designate employees of the 
40 depatiment who are not attorneys to represent the depatiment in court if a hearing is held. 
41 The commissioner shall ensure that appropriate training is provided to all employees who 
42 are designated to represent the department under this subsection.

13 terminated under section 5-203; and 
14 F. Any guardian or conservator currently acting for the minor in this State or 
15 elsewhere. 
16 If the court finds that receiving information from the Department of Health and Human 
17 Services may be necessary for the determination of any issue before the court, it may 
18 order a Department of Health and Human Services employee to attend the hearing and to 
19 provide information relevant to the proceeding. When receiving infonnation by oral 
20 testimony that is confidential pursuant to Title 22, section 4008, the court shall close the 
21 proceeding and ensure that it is recorded. When receiving information contained in 
22 written or media records that is confidential pursuant to Title 22, section 4008, the court

2. Contract void against individual and property. If an individual subject to

transaction affected by a substantial conflict between fiducia1y duties and personal 
interests includes a sale, encumbrance or other transaction involving the conservatorship

1 5-414, is protected as though the conservator properly exercised the power in question.

4 propriety of the conservator's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority that are 
5 stated in letters of office, or as otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. 
6 A person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper 
7 application of the property. 
8 2. Application of protection. Protection under subsection 1 extends to a procedural 
9 irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the issuance of letters of 
10 office and is not a substitute for protection provided to a person that assists or deals with 
11 a conservator by comparable provisions in law of this State other than this Act relating to 
12 commercial transactions or simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries. 
13 §5-427. Death of individual subject to conservatorship

16 possession and inform the personal representative named in the will if feasible, or if not 
17 feasible a beneficiary named in the will, of the delivery. 
18 2. Powers and duties of personal representative; notice. If 40 days after the death

22 distribute the decedent's estate. The conservator shall give notice to a person nominated 
23 as personal representative by a will of the decedent of which the conservator is aware and 
24 to all of the decedent's heirs and all devisees of the will, if any. The court may grant the 
25 application if there is no objection and endorse the letters of office to note that the 
26 individual formerly subject to conservatorship is deceased and the conservator has 
27 acquired the powers and duties of a personal representative. 
28 3. Effect of appointment as personal representative. Issuance of an order under 
29 this section has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative under 
30 section 3-308 and Article 3, Parts 6 to 10. 
31 4. Distribution; discharge. On the death of an individual subject to 
32 conservatorship, the conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship 
33 estate by distributing property subject to conservatorship to the individual's successors. 
34 Not later than 30 days after distribution, the conservator shall file a final report and 
3 5 petition for discharge.

allowed if it is not disallowed by the conservator in a record sent or delivered to the 
claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation. Before payment the conservator 
may change an allowance of the claim to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after 
allowance under a court order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a 
claim tolls the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the claim 
until 30 days after its disallowance. 
3. Unpaid claim. A claimant whose claim under subsection 1 has not been paid may 
petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is baned by a statute of 
limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment or security by encumbering 
property included in the conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the 
individual subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is 
initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of the proceeding if 
it could result in creating a claim against the conservatorship estate.

all existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind

D. A claim arising before the conservatorship; and 
E. All other claims. 
5. Preference of claims. Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim 
under subsection 4 over another claim of the same class. A claim due and payable may 
not be prefened over a claim not due unless: 
A. Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient funds to pay 
the basic living and health care expenses of the individual subject to conservatorship; 
and 
B. The court authorizes the preference under section 5-414, subsection 1, paragraph 
H. 
6. Security interest in conservatorship estate. If assets of a conservatorship estate­
are adequate to meet all existing claims, the comt, acting in the best interest of the 
individual subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security 
interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date.

die. You can revoke it at any time. You are also free to transfer the property to someone 
else during your· lifetime. If you do not own any interest in the property when you die, 
this deed will have no effect. 
How do I make a TOD deed? Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before a 
nota1y public or othei: individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Record the 
form in each county where any part of the property is located. The form has no effect 
unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death. 
Is the "legal description" of the property necessary? Yes. 
How do I find the "legal description" of the property? This information may be on the 
deed you received when you became an owner of the property. This information may 
also be available in the registry of deeds for the county where the property is located. If 
you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer. 
Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed? Yes. If you have not yet 
recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the 
deed. 
How do I "record" the TOD deed? Take the completed and acknowledged form to the 
registry of deeds of the county where the property is located. Follow the instrnctions 
given by the register of deeds to make the form part of the official property records. If 
the property is in more than one county, you should record the deed in each county. 
Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind? Yes. You can revoke the 
TOD deed. No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed. 
How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? There are three ways to revoke a 
recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in 
each county where the property is located. (2) Complete and acknowledge a new TOD 
deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each county where the property 
is located. (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime by a recorded 
deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD deed by will. 
I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I do? Do not complete this 
form under pressure. Seek help from a trusted family member, friend, or lawyer. 
Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed? No, but it is recommended.

6 the child and a putative parent has not consented to the adoption of the child or joined in a 
7 surrender and release for the purpose of adoption of the child or waived the right to 
8 notice, the parent must file an affidavit of parentage with the court so that the court may 
9 determine how to give notice of the proceedings to the putative parent.

25 become the legal guardian, custodian or parent of the child. 
26 A. The waiver of notice must indicate that the putative parent understands that the 
27 waiver of notice operates as a consent to adoption or a surrender and release for the 
28 purposes of adoption for any adoption of the child and that by signing the waiver of 
29 notice the putative parent voluntarily gives up any rights to the child. 
30 B. The waiver of notice may state that the putative parent neither admits nor denies 
31 parentage. 
32 4. Determination of parentage of putative parent. If, after notice, the putative 
33 parent of the child wishes to establish parentage of the child, the putative parent must, 
34 within 20 days after notice has been given or within a longer period of time as ordered by 
35 the court, petition the court to initiate proceedings to establish parentage under Title 
36 19-A, chapter 61.

9 determined to be the child's parent pursuant to one or more of the means of establishing 
10 parentage under Title 19-A, chapter 61, and does not execute a waiver of notice pursuant 
11 to subsection 3, then a petitioner must bring a petition to terminate the parent's parental 
12 rights pursuant to section 9-204 if the petitioner proceeds with the adoption. 
13 10. Findings; putative parent does not seek to establish or establish parentage of 
14 the child. If the putative parent does not bring a petition to establish parentage under 
15 subsection 4 or does not establish parentage of the child under Title 19-A, chapter 61, the

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 In Article 2, Part 1, subpart 2, the amendment replaces language to make the 
2 language consistent with how the Maine Parentage Act in the Maine Revised Statutes, 
3 Title 19-A, chapter 61 provides for the establishment and determination of parentage. 
4 In section 2-208, subsection 1, paragraph B, the amendment inserts "except as 
5 provided in paragraph C" to exclude a category of trusts in using the particular procedure 
6 to determine the value of property. New paragraph C describes the value of the surviving 
7 spouse's beneficial interest in a trust from which distributions of both income and 
8 principal to the surviving spouse are subject to the trustee's discretion. 
9 In section 2-403, the amendment inserts "of tangible personal property, including but 
10 not limited to" to appropriately reference the exemption amounts for the various 
11 categories of personal property. The specific amounts of the exemptions are listed in 
12 Title 14, section 4422. 
13 In section 2-705, the amendment replaces the section to be consistent with the 
14 establishment of parent-child relationships under the Maine Parentage Act. 
15 In Article 3, section 3-607, the amendment inserts a new subsection 2, which requires 
16 the court to set and hold a hearing on a petition filed to restrain the personal 
17 representative of an estate from carrying out specific actions. Notice must be given to the 
18 personal representative, the personal representative's attorney and any other parties 
19 named defendant in the petition. 
20 In section 3-711, the amendment inserts "except as limited by this section" and it 
21 reinstates current Maine law that prohibits the personal representative from selling or 
22 transferring any interest in real property of the estate without giving notice at least 10 
23 days prior to the sale or transfer, unless the will authorizes the personal representative to 
24 sell or transfer real estate without the notice. 
25 In section 3-1201, subsection 1, paragraph A, the amendment changes the maximum 
26 value of property for which an affidavit of a small estate may be filed from $50,000 in the 
27 bill to $40,000. Current law is $20,000. 
28 In Article 4, section 4-204, the amendment retains current law requiring a certificate 
29 from another jurisdiction that is no more than 60 days old as evidence of a foreign 
30 personal representative's current authority. · 
31 In Article 5, Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the bill are deleted and replaced with a version of 
32 the . Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act, 
33 UGCOPAA, revised by the Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission, PATLAC, and 
34 the Family Law Advismy Commission, FLAC, resulting in new Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
35 The bill was carried over to the Second Regular Session of the l28th Legislature to 
36 allow PATLAC, with the assistance ofFLAC, to review the UGCOPAA, approved by the 
3 7 Uniform Law Commission in July 2017. This amendment is based on the 
38 recommendations of PATLAC for Article 5, Parts 1, general provisions; 3, adult 
39 guardianship; 4, conservatorship; and 5, other protective arrangements, and FLAC for 
40 Parts 1 and 2, minor guardianship. 
41 The following is from the Uniform Law Commission's Prefatory Note for the 
42 Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act. 
43 The Act has 3 overarching aims.

46 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
First, it aims to reflect the person-centered philosophy endorsed by the [Third 
National Guardian Summit] NGS. The person-centered approach is evidenced in the 
Act's updated terminology. The terms "ward" and "incapacitated person," which 
were rejected by the NGS as demeaning and even offensive, are eliminated and the 
more precise terms "adult subject to guardianship," "minor subject to guardianship," 
and "individual subject to conservatorship" are used instead. The person-centered 
approach is also evident in new provisions requiring that individuals subject to 
guardianship or conscrvatorship be given meaningful notice of their rights and how to 
assert them; provisions that require involving individuals subject to guardianship and 
conservatorship in decisions about their lives; requirements that guardians and 
conservators create person-centered plans; and provisions to facilitate court 
monitoring of compliance with those plans. 
Second, the Act aims to create legal rnles that advance key objectives embraced by 
the NGS, including respecting and protecting the rights and interests of both 
individuals alleged to need a guardian or conservator and individuals subject to 
guardianship or conservatorship. These include provisions designed to ensure that 
the least restrictive means are used to protect an individual alleged to need a 
guardianship or conservatorship, to provide better guidance to guardians and 
conservators, and to help courts monitor guardians and conservators. 
Third, the Act aims to advance rnles and systems that make it easier for all persons 
involved in the process, whether they be petitioners, individuals subject to 
guardianship or conservatorship, guardians or conservators, or judges, to achieve 
these objectives. It does this in a number of ways. These include creating new 
petition requirements to ensure that judges have the information needed to make 
appropriate decisions; creating an option for courts to enter orders instead of 
guardianship or conservatorship where such less restrictive altematives would meet a 
respondent's need; and offering model forms to make it easier for petitioners to seek 
limited appointments instead of full ones. 
With these overarching objectives in mind, a number of more specific changes are 
likely to be particularly noteworthy to those considering the Act. 
First, the Act includes clearer guidance to guardians and conservators, many of whom 
are lay people. Specifically, the Act clarifies how appointees are to make decisions, 
including decisions about particularly fraught issues such as medical treatment and 
residential placement. These clarifications are consistent with the person-centered 
approach embraced by the Act in that appointees are given specific guidance on 
involving the individual in decisions. 
Second, the Act recognizes the role of, and encourages the use of, less restrictive 
altematives, including supported decision-maldng and single-issue comt orders 
instead of guardianship and conservatorship. To this end, the Act provides that 
neither guardianship nor conservatorship is appropriate where an adult's needs can be 
met with technological assistance or suppo1ted decision-making. It also provides for 
protective arrangements instead of guardianship or conservatorship; the 1997 version, 
by contrast, only provided for such an arrangement as an alternative to 
conservatorship. These alternative arrangements have the potential to reduce the 
extent to which individuals in need of protection are deprived of libe1ties. They can 
also reduce the time and cost associated with meeting individuals' needs. Unlike a

guardianship or conservatorship, long-term monitoring and reporting will generally 
be unnecessary. 
Third, the Act expands the procedural rights for respondents with the aim of ensuring 
that respondents' rights are fully respected and that guardianships and 
conservatorships are only imposed when less restrictive alternatives are not feasible. 
In expanding these protections, the Act strikes a balance between the need to provide 
meaningful procedural rights for individuals alleged to need a guardian or 
conservator, and the need to avoid making the appointment process overly complex 
or expensive. Key revisions include narrowing the exception to the general rule that 
the respondent must be present at the hearing, a requirement that explicit findings be 
made before certain fundamental rights are removed, and the elimination of 
provisions that would have allowed appointment of a guardian for an adult by will or 
other writing without prior judicial approval. 
Fourth, the Act provides for enhanced monitoring of guardians and conservators to 
ensure that such appointees are complying with their fiduciary duties and that 
individuals subject to guardianship and conservatorship are protected against 
exploitation. One innovation in the Act is to allow the court to identify people who 
are to be given notice of certain key changes or suspect actions, and who can 
therefore serve as an extra set of eyes and ears for the court. Other revisions include 
a provision that makes bond a default option for conservators and the addition of 
provisions that clarify factors relevant in determining the reasonableness of fees for 
guardians and conservators. 
Fifth, the Act provides enhanced procedural rights for individuals subject to 
guardianship and conservatorship. Key changes from the 1997 Act include a 
provision that the court provide such individuals with plain-language notice of key 
rights, the addition of provisions for attorney representation of individuals subject to 
guardianship and conservatorship, greater scrutiny of the guardian or conservator's 
ability to charge fees to oppose the individual's efforts to alter the appointment, and 
additional triggers for reconsideration of an appointment. 
Sixth, recognizing that individuals subject to guardianship and conservatorship 
benefit from visitation and communication with third parties, the Act sets forth 
specific rights to such interactions. In recent years, some family members of 
individuals subject to guardianship have raised concerns that guardians have 
unreasonably restricted the ability of individuals subject to guardianship to receive 
visitors and communicate with others, and family advocates have encouraged 
legislative responses to address this concern. The Act includes a variety of 
provisions addressing this concern. These include a limitation on a guardian's ability 
to curtail communications, visits, or interactions between an adult subject to 
guardianship and third parties and a requirement that a guardian prioritize residential 
settings that allow the individual subject to guardianship to interact with those 
important to the individual. In a similar vein, it establishes a default that the adult 
children and spouse of an adult subject to guardianship or conservatorship are entitled 
to notice of key events, including a change in the adult's primary residence, the adult's 
death, or a significant change in the adult's condition. 
Seventh, the Act creates a new mechanism for protecting individuals from 
exploitation. Section 503 of the Act allows a court, without imposing a guardianship 
Page 215 -128LR0452(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 or conservatorship or ruling on the individual's abilities, to restrict access to the 
2 respondent or the respondent's property by a specified person that the court finds by 
3 clear-and-convincing evidence: (1) through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of 
4 deception and control, caused, or attempted to cause, an action that would have 
5 resulted in financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and (2) 
6 poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's 
7 prope1ty. This allows courts to create tailored orders to protect vulnerable individuals 
8 at risk of substantial exploitation even though the individual might not have the level 
9 of limitation in abilities necessa1y to impose a conservatorship or guardianship. At 
10 the same time, it discourages courts from imposing a guardianship or conservatorship 
11 if a limited order would meet an individual's needs. 
12 Eighth, the Act contains a variety of provisions designed to improve compliance with 
13 the Act's prohibition on courts establishing a full guardianship or conservatorship if a 
14 limited guardianship or conservatorship would meet the respondent's needs. The 
15 [Uniform Law Commission] Drafting Committee recognized that, despite the best 
16 efforts of previous Committees, there is a lack of compliance with the prohibition 
17 even though it was included in the 1997 Act. In order to facilitate compliance, the 
18 Act includes a sample petition which makes it easier for a petitioner to seek a limited 
19 order. [This amendment does not include the forms proposed by the ULC.] In 
20 addition, the Act requires petitioners seeking a full guardianship or conservatorship to 
21 do more to justify that approach, and courts imposing a full guardianship to provide 
22 findings to support that imposition. 
23 Ninth, the Act modernizes and clarifies provisions related to minors subject to 
24 guardianship. [Note that this amendment does not adopt Part 2 of the Uniform 
25 Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act, which 
26 pertains to minors. It instead includes the recommendations that both PATLAC and 
27 FLAC reported to the Judiciary Committee in Januaiy 2017, with some updated 
28 provisions.] 
29 Tenth, the Act contains updated provisions to govern property management for 
30 individuals subject to conservatorship. In updating property management protections, 
31 the Drafting Committee looked to the Uniform Prudent Investor Act and the Uniform 
32 Trust Code, among other sources of guidance. 
33 Finally, the Act has been reorganized with the aim of making it easier to understand. 
34 Ease of use is important as many of those who need to comply with its directives are 
35 not attorneys, but are family members or friends responding to urgent or unstable 
36 circumstances, or are individuals with limited resources and significa11t functional 
37 challenges. 
38 The amendment strikes Article 5, Pait 1 of the bill, and adopts the UGCOP AA 
39 Article 1 with the following changes. 
40 The amendment includes 2 additional definitions. "Best interest of the minor" cross-
41 references the meaning of "best interest" as defined in Title 19-A, section 1653, 
42 subsection 3. The other additional definition is "suitable" to describe appropriate 
43 qualifications for a person to be appointed as a guardian for a minor.

The amendment retains from current law provisions governing the facility of transfer 
of money or personal property to a minor. It is currently Title 18-A, section 5-104, and 
was not included in the UGCOP AA. The amendment clarifies that a person who receives 
money or property for a minor may receive reimbursement for necessary expenses that 
benefit the minor. 
The amendment addresses concerns raised about whether a guardian or conservator 
can waive any required notice on behalf of the individual subject to guardianship or 
conservatorship. This amendment provides that an appointed guardian or an appointed 
conservator may not waive the right to notice on behalf of an individual subject to 
guardianship or conservatorship. 
The amendment makes clear that the role of a guardian ad litem is to identify and 
represent the individual's best interest or perform other duties the court directs. It 
provides that the same guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent more than one 
individual as long as no conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists. It also 
clarifies that the order appointing the guardian ad litem must state the responsibility for 
paying the guardian ad litem fees. 
The amendment requires additional notice be given when a person interested in the 
welfare of a respondent but not otherwise entitled to notice requests to receive notice of 
proceedings. Notice of the request must be given to the guardian or conservator, as well 
as the individual subject to the guardianship or conservatorship, and they are provided a 
60-day window during which to object to giving notice to the person requesting notice. If 
there is an objection, the court must hold a hearing on the request and make a decision on 
whether to grant the request after the hearing. 
The amendment requires the person petitioning to be appointed the guardian or 
conservator to disclose bankruptcy and criminal background information. In addition, a 
guardian or conservator is prohibited from engaging an agent who the guardian or 
conservator knows has been convicted of certain serious crimes without the approval of 
the court. 
The amendment provides that the court, after notice to all interested persons, on the 
petition of an interested person, may review the propriety of the employment of any 
person by the guardian or conservator, as well as the reasonableness of compensation. 
The court may order anyone who has received excessive compensation to make 
appropriate refunds. 
The amendment requires a person who refuses to recognize the authority of a 
guardian or conservator to report to the court when the person believes the guardian's or 
conservator's proposed action would be inconsistent with the statute, or the person 
believes the person subject to guardianship or conservatorship is subjected to abu.se, 
neglect, exploitation or abandonment by the guardian or conservator or someone acting 
for or with the guardian or conservator. 
The amendment establishes a fee for registering a guardianship or conservatorship 
appointment order from another jurisdiction. 
The amendment clarifies that an individual subject to guardianship or 
conservatorship, or a person interested in the individual's welfare, can report a grievance 
to the court in writing or another record. The report is not required to be formally filed.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEEAMENDMENT"A "to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 The Family Law Advisory Commission was charged with reviewing and making 
2 recommendations conceming parental rights and responsibilities in the minor 
3 guardianship statutes by Resolve 2015, chapter 73, section 3. The provisions of the 
4 UGCOP AA pertaining to minor guardianship depart in significant respects from existing 
5 Maine law and practice. In addition, the UGCOP AA does not reflect many of the 
6 important reforms recommended to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary in FLACs 
7 January 15, 2017 report and recommendations, which were based on the findings from its 
8 comprehensive review of Maine minor guardianship laws and practice, including 
9 valuable contributions from dozens of Maine stakeholders. This amendment incorporates 
10 the changes to Article 5, Patt 2 contained in the bill recommended by FLAC and does not 
11 adopt the UGCOP AA with regard to minor guardianships. 
12 The amendment provides that when the court is appointing a guardian of a minor as 
13 requested by a parent, the minor, if at least 14 years of age, the other parent or other 
14 person who has care or custody of the minor may object or terminate the appointment. 
15 The objection does not preclude the court from appointing the guardian if all other 
16 requirements for appointment, including appointment over the objection of a parent, are 
17 met. The court may treat the filing of an objection as a petition for the appointment of an 
18 emergency or an interim guardian and proceed accordingly. 
19 The amendment establishes grounds for appointment of a suitable guardian based on 
20 the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's rnlings pertaining to the fundamental rights of 
21 parents. It requires that, before a guardian may be appointed for a minor, the court must 
22 find that the parents consent, that all parental rights have been terminated or that by clear 
23 and convincing evidence the parents are unwilling or unable to exercise their parental 
24 rights. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, that the parent is currently unwilling 
25 or unable to meet the child's needs and that will have a substantial adverse effect on the 
26 child's well-being if the child lives with the parent, or that the parent has failed, without 
27 good cause, to maintain a parental relationship with the child including, but not limited 
28 to, failure to maintain regular contact with the child for a length of time that evidences an 
29 intent to abandon the child. 
30 The amendment replaces the temporary guardian provisions with the authorization to 
31 appoint a guardian on an emergency basis. The duration of the guardian's authority may 
32 not exceed 90 days and the guardian may exercise only those powers specified in the 
33 order. Reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing on the petition for 
34 appointment must be given unless it could result in substantial harm to the minor. If the 
3 5 guardian is appointed without notice, notice of the appointment must be given within 48 
36 hours, and the court must schedule a hearing within 14 days but not less than 7 days after 
37 the issuance of the order. Counsel for a parent may request that the hearing take place 
38 sooner. The petitioner for the emergency appointment bears the burden of proof on the 
39 appropriateness of the appointment. 
40 The court's order must indicate whether there are any child support orders currently in 
41 effect and the effect of the guardianship order on the child support orders. The couti 
42 must consider whether a parent is to pay child support to the guardian, and must treat the 
43 guardian as a "caretaker relative" for computation of a parental support obligation under 
44 Title 19-A, section 2006, subsection 4.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 The amendment authorizes the court to direct an employee of the Department of 
2 Health and Human Services to provide information relevant to a guardianship proceeding. 
3 The court must protect the confidentiality of info1mation. 
4 The court must appoint a person or persons who are nominated by the minor, if the 
5 minor is at least 14 years of age, in accordance with the other appointment requirements. 
6 A nonconsenting parent whose parental rights have not been terminated is entitled to 
7 court-appointed counsel if indigent. The court may also appoint counsel for any indigent 
8 guardian or petitioner if the parent has counsel. 
9 A minor who is 14 years of age or older must receive notice of proceedings 
IO subsequent to the appointment of a guardian. A minor may appear with or through 
11 counsel, but the court may still require the minor to be present for some or all of a hearing 
12 or other proceeding. 
13 The amendment provides that if the petition for guardianship of a minor is filed by or 
14 with the consent of a parent, the written informed consent of the parent is required. A 
15 parent who consents to the guardianship after the petition is filed must sign the written 
16 consent form when consenting to the appointment. 
17 The court may specify the duration of the appointment, and the term may be extended 
18 or otherwise modified. 
19 The court may enter an interim order appointing a guardian for a period of time of up 
20 to 6 months or pending the court's order if necessary to provide for the minor's housing, 
21 health, education, medical or other essential needs prior to the hearing. The interim order 
22 must meet all the other requirements, including notice, and may be extended or modified. 
23 The court may refer the parties to mediation if mediation services are available at 
24 reasonable or no cost. 
25 If a party alleges in an affidavit or a pleading under oath that the health, safety or 
26 liberty of a party or the minor would be jeopardized by disclosure of identifying 
27 information, the information must be sealed and not disclosed unless ordered by the court 
28 after notice and hearing. 
29 The amendment specifies the terms that must be included in the order appointing a 
30 guardian for a minor. If any orders concerning custody or other parental rights of the 
31 minor are in effect at the time of the appointment of the guardian, the order must refer to 
32 such orders and indicate the effect of the appointment on the rights and responsibilities 
33 set forth in the other orders. · 
34 An order appointing a guardian must specify the rights and responsibilities the 
35 minor's parent retains. A parent may copetition and be appointed as a coguardian of the 
36 minor if the court determines the joint appointment with a non-parent is in the minor's 
37 best interest and is made with the parent's consent. 
3 8 The court may require the guardian to submit regular status reports about the minor, 
39 to be submitted under oath or affirmation to the court and served on the parent on an 
40 annual basis or under other conditions set by the court. The contents of status reports are 
41 confidential and may not be released to a nonparty except by order of the court. A parent 
42 may petition the court to seek a status report when one is not required. A person who is 
43 not a parent who is interested in the minor's welfare may petition the court to seek a status

1 report based upon specific concerns about the minor's care. If there is an active guardian 
2 ad litem, the guardian ad litem may also receive the report. The court must accept any 
3 information submitted by a minor 14 years of age or older regarding the guardianship. 
4 A guardian, a parent of the minor, a person interested in the welfare of the minor or 
5 the minor, if 14 years of age or older, may file a motion asking the court to modify the 
6 terms of the order or take other action in the best interest of the minor. The court may 
7 identify certain requirements that must be met before making modifications. 
8 The amendment provides for the termination of the appointment of a guardian or 
9 conservator. A minor, if 14 years of age or older, a parent or a person interested in the 
10 welfare of the minor may petition for removal of a guardian on the ground the removal 
11 would be in the best interest of the minor or for other good cause. A guardian may 
12 petition to resign. The court may appoint an additional or successor guardian. 
13 Except upon a petition to terminate the guardianship filed by the parent, the court 
14 may not te1minate the guardianship without the consent of the guardian unless the court 
15 finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the termination is in the best interest of the 
16 minor. If a parent petitions for the termination of the guardianship, the party opposing 
17 the parent's termination bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence 
18 that the parent seeking to terminate the guardianship is currently unfit to regain custody 
19 of the minor. If the party fails to prove the parent is unfit, the court must terminate the 
20 guardianship and make any further order that may be appropriate. This section cross-
21 references the standard for finding that a parent is unfit. 
22 In determining the best interest of the minor in ordering transitional arrangements, the 
23 court may consider the minor's relationship with the guardians and the need for stability. 
24 In any guardianship proceeding, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the 
25 minor. 
26 This amendment strikes Article 5, Part 3 of the bill and adopts the UGCOPAA 
27 Atiicle 3 with the following changes. 
28 The amendment provides a 3rd criterion for the appointment of a guardian for an 
29 adult: that the appointment is necessary or desirable as a means of enabling the 
30 respondent to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety and self-care. This 
31 is intended to preclude the appointment of a guardian for an adult when the guardianship 
32 would not benefit the adult. 
33 The amendment requires that a petition for guardianship include the attorney's 
34 telephone number and bar registration number if the petitioner has an attorney. 
3 5 The amendment requires the visitor appointed by the court to include in the report 
3 6 whether or not the respondent wishes to contest any aspect of the proceedings or to seek 
37 any limitation on the proposed guardian's powers. This is in addition to a 
38 recommendation whether an attorney should be appointed to represent the respondent and 
39 several other items that must be included in the repo1t The visitor must also include 
40 whether a further professional evaluation of the respondent is recommended. 
41 The UGCOP AA does not require an initial professional evaluation; this amendment 
42 requires a professional evaluation in every adult guardianship. 
Page 220 -128LR0452(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 The amendment provides that the court is required to appoint an attorney for the 
2 respondent, in addition to in the 3 fact situations presented in the UGCOP AA, when it 
3 comes to the court's attention that the respondent wishes to contest any aspect of the 
4 proceeding or to seek any limitation on the proposed guardian's powers. The other fact 
5 situations in which appointment of an attorney is mandatory are: when requested by the 
6 respondent, when recommended by the visitor, and when the court determines the 
7 respondent needs representation. 
8 The amendment revises which professionals are appropriate for conducting an 
9 evaluation and limits it to licensed physicians and psychologists approved by the court 
10 and qualified to conduct the evaluation. 
11 The amendment recognizes that an agent appointed by the respondent in an advance 
12 health cal'e directive is, if othel'Wise qualified, eligible for appointment as the guardian at 
13 the 4th level of priority. 
14 The amendment continues the disqualification for appointment as a guardian an 
15 owner, operator or employee of a long-term care institution in which the respondent is 
16 receiving care, unless the owner, operator or employee is related to the respondent. 
17 The amendment provides that if the order of appointment does not completely 
18 remove the right to marry but allows the adult subject to guardianship to marry if certain 
19 conditions are satisfied, the order must state the conditions as well as the findings on 
20 which those conditions are based. 
21 Consistent with the UGCOP AA, this amendment provides for specific notice 
22 requirements for numerous interested parties, but reduces the notice requirements for 
23 notice of the appointment from what is required under the UGCOP AA. This amendment 
24 retains required notice by the appointed guardian to the adult subject to guardianship and 
25 all other persons required to receive notice under section 5-303, rather than duplicating 
26 the notice requirements under section 5-310. 
27 With regard to the appointment of an emergency guardian, this amendment provides 
28 that the initial appointment may not exceed 60 days, but that the emergency appointment 
29 may be extended by up to 120 days. This amendment adopts the notice requirements for 
30 filing a petition for an emergency guardian that are in the bill, that is, tqat the petition 
31 must notify, orally or in writing, the respondent as well as the respondent's family and 
32 any person who is serving as the guardian or conservator or who has care and custody of 
33 the respondent. If the petitioner believes giving prior notice would put the respondent at 
34 substantial risk of abuse, neglect or exploitation, the petitioner must so state in an 
35 affidavit. 
36 If the court appoints the emergency guardian without notice and hearing, notice of the 
37 emergency appointment must be provided within 48 hours of the appointment. This 
38 amendment provides that if any person objects to the appointment of the emergency 
3 9 guardian, the court must hold a hearing within 14 days after the appointment. 
40 The amendment modifies the duties of a guardian to include the authority to 
41 administer assets of a value of $5,000 orless. 
42 The amendment differs from the UGCOPAA by requiring the person seeking 
43 . appointment as guardian to file the plan for the care of the adult with the petition for

1 appointment. When there is a subsequent change in circumstances or the guardian seeks 
2 to deviate significantly from the plan, the guardian must file with the court a revised plan 
3 for the care of the adult. The plan must contain specific elements. The persons required 
4 to receive notice of the petition must also receive a copy of the plan and any revised plan. 
5 The court is required to review the plan and any revised plan, and consider objections. 
6 The court may schedule a hearing on any revised plan and may not approve the revised 
7 plan until 30 days after filing. 
8 The amendment provides that the guardian must file a report with the court at least 
9 annually. After notice and hearing, the court may approve the guardian's report, which 
10 creates a rebuttable presumption that the report is accurate as to a matter adequately 
11 disclosed in the report. 
12 The amendment strikes Article 5, Part 4 of the bill and adopts the UGCOP AA, 
13 Article 4 with the following changes. 
14 Throughout Part 4, this amendment establishes that the court is required to consider 
15 the wishes of a minor who is at least 14 years of age, rather than 12 years of age as 
16 provided in the UGCOP AA. 
1 7 The amendment provides that a petition for conservatorship must include, along with 
18 other specifically identified inf01mation, the name and contact information for an agent 
19 designated by the respondent in an advance health care directive. This amendment 
20 requires that a petition for conservatorship include the attorney's telephone number and 
21 bar registration number if the petitioner has an attorney. 
22 The amendment does not include the provisions of the UGCOPAA pertaining to 
23 property while a petition for conservatorship is pending, but instead includes the 
24 provisions of current law in Title 18-A, section 5-404 authorizing a person to petition for 
25 the appointment of a conservator or for any other appropriate protective order when the 
26 person is any of the following: the person to be protected; any person who is interested in 
27 the estate, affairs or welfare of the person to be protected; and any person who would be 
28 adversely affected by lack of effective management of the property and affairs of the 
29 person to be protected. 
30 The amendment provides that the petition for conservatorship must be personally 
31 served on the respondent at least 14 days prior to the hearing on the petition. Notice must 
32 also be provided 14 days before the hearing to all the other persons required to receive 
33 notice. 
34 The amendment requires the court to appoint a visitor when the respondent is an 
35 adult, unless the adult is represented by an attorney. 
36 The visitor must file a report at least 10 days before any hearing on the petition. The 
3 7 report must include whether or not the respondent wants to challenge any aspect of the 
38 proceeding or to seek any limitation on the conservator's powers. The rep01i must also 
39 contain a recommendation concerning whether a further professional evaluation is 
40 necessary. 
41 The amendment requires the comt to appoint an attorney, in addition to the 
42 circumstances provided in the UGCOP AA, when it comes to the court's attention that the

1 respondent wishes to contest any aspect of the proceeding or to seek any limitation on the 
2 proposed conservator's powers. 
3 The amendment deviates from the UGCOP AA by not requiring but authorizing the 
4 court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent of a minor who is the subject of a 
5 conservatorship proceeding. 
6 The UGCOP AA does not require an initial professional evaluation; this amendment 
7 requires a professional evaluation in every adult conservatorship. This amendment 
8 revises which professionals are appropriate for conducting an evaluation, and limits it to 
9 licensed physicians and psychologists approved by the court and qualified to conduct the 
10 evaluation. 
11 The individual conducting the professional evaluation must file the evaluation with 
12 the court at least 10 days before any hearing on the petition. 
13 The amendment continues the disqualification for appointment as a conservator an 
14 owner, operator or employee of a long-term care institution in which the respondent is 
15 receiving care, unless the owner, operator or employee is related to the respondent. 
16 Consistent with the UGCOP AA, this amendment provides for specific notice 
17 requirements for numerous interested parties, but reduces the notice requirements for 
18 notice of the appointment from what is required under the UGCOPAA. This amendment 
19 retains required notice by the appointed guardian to the adult subject to guardianship and 
20 all other persons required to receive notice under section 5-403, rather than duplicating 
21 the notice requirements under section 5-411. 
22 With regard to the appointment of an emergency conservator, this amendment 
23 provides that the initial appointment may not exceed 60 days, but that the emergency 
24 appointment may be extended by up to 120 days. This amendment adopts the notice 
25 requirements for filing a petition for an emergency guardian that are in the bill, that is, 
26 that the petition must notify, orally or in writing, the respondent as well as the 
27 respondent's family and any person who is serving as the guardian or conservator or who 
28 has care and custody of the respondent. If the petitioner believes giving prior notice 
29 would put the respondent at substantial risk of abuse, neglect or exploitation, the 
30 petitioner must so state in an affidavit. 
31 If the court appoints the emergency conservator without notice and heating, notice of 
32 the emergency appointment must be provided within 48 hours of the appointment. This 
33 amendment provides that if any person objects to the appointment of the emergency 
34 conservator, the court must hold a hearing within 14 days after the appointment. 
35 The amendment differs from the UGCOPAA by requiring the person seeking 
36 appointment as conservator to file the plan for protecting, managing, expending and 
3 7 distributing assets of the conservatorship estate with the petition for appointment. When 
38 there is a subsequent change in circumstances or the conservator seeks to deviate 
39 significantly from the plan, the conservator must file with the court a revised plan for 
40 protecting, managing, expending and distributing assets of the conservatorship estate. 
41 The plan must contain specific elements. The persons required to receive notice of the 
42 petition must also receive a copy of the plan and any revised plan. The court is required 
43 to review the plan and any revised plan, and consider objections. The court may schedule 
Page 223 -128LR0452(02)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 91, L.D. 123 
1 a hearing on any revised plan and may not approve the revised plan until 30 days after 
2 filing. 
3 The amendment requires the conservator to include a credit report of the individual 
4 subject to conservatorship in the report and accounting submitted to the court. The credit 
5 report must be kept confidential. 
6 The conservator may petition the court for approval of the report or accounting filed 
7 with the court. An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report or accounting 
8 discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims and causes of action by a person 
9 given notice of the report and the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report 
10 or accounting. 
11 The amendment provides that when the individual subject to conservatorship dies, 
12 and no personal representative has been appointed for 40 days, the conservator may apply 
13 to the court to exercise the powers of a personal representative. The conservator must 
14 give notice to any person nominated as personal representative in the will of which the 
15 conservator is aware, all of the decedent's heirs and all devisees of the will. This is an 
16 expansion from the UGCOP AA. 
17 The amendment provides that if the individual who is subject to conservatorship 
18 seeks to remove the conservator, the court must appoint an attorney if the individual is 
19 not already represented by one. 
20 The amendment provides that if the individual who is subject to conservatorship 
21 seeks to terminate or modify the terms of the conservatorship, the court must appoint an 
22 attorney if the individual is not already represented by one. 
23 The amendment adopts Article 5 of the UGCOP AA as Part 5 of Article 5, with the 
24 following changes. 
25 The amendment clarifies that one or more protective arrangements may be 
26 appropriate in any given circumstance. 
27 The amendment provides that a petition for one or more protective atTangements 
28 must include the name and address of the respondent's spouse or domestic partner, if the 
29 respondent has one. 
30 The amendment provides that the court must appoint an attorney to represent the 
31 respondent, in addition to the 3 circumstances in the UGCOP AA, when it comes to the 
32 court's attention that the respondent wishes to contest any aspect of the proceeding or to 
33 seek any limitation on the proposed protective atrnngement. 
34 The UGCOP AA provides that a hearing may proceed without the respondent in 
35 attendance only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that at least one of 
36 several circumstances exist. This amendment adds 2 additional circumstances: if the 
3 7 respondent is represented by an attorney and the attorney represents that the respondent 
3 8 does not want to attend the hearing; and if the visitor has confirmed with the respondent 
39 that the respondent has no objection to the protective arrangements and that the 
40 respondent does not wish to attend the hearing. 
41 Article 5, Part 6 in the amendment is Part 5 of the bill, and Article 5, Part 7 in the 
42 amendment is Part 6 in the bill. The only changes from the bill are to renumber and fix

cross-references and to address the changes in the UGCOP AA that delete the use of the 
concept and the term "incapacitated person. t1 The amendment uses the term 11individual 
subject to guardianship11 to be consistent with new Part 3. It also replaces the term 
11ward11 with 11individual subject to guardianship. ti 
With regard to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, section 5-710, the Legislature 
intends to continue the prior practice that the State is immune from suit on all tort claims 
seeldng recovery of damages as public guardian or public conservator, but that the surety 
is responsible for all risk of loss for assets managed by the public guardian or public 
conservator. 
Article 5, Part 8 in the amendment is Part 7 in the bill. The only changes from the 
bill are to renumber and fix cross-references. 
Article 5, Part 9 in the amendment is Part 8 in the bill. The only changes from the 
bill are to renumber and fix cross-references. 
Article 6 of the bill adopts the Uniform Probate Code provisions concerning 
nonprobate transfers, except that it does not include Part 4, the Uniform Real Property 
Transfer on Death Act. The Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act was proposed 
as part ofL.D. 969, 11An Act Regarding Nonprobate Transfers on Death.11 
This amendment includes the Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act as a new 
Part 4 to Article 6. The text is based on L.D. 969, with the following amendments. 
It amends the. definition of "joint owner11 to remove references to tenancies by the 
entirety and community property, which are not recognized concepts in Maine. 
It clarifies that the definition of 11person11 includes a trustee but not a business trust or 
other trust. 
It provides that the transfer on death deed can be used only when the property is 
transferred for no consideration. This is consistent with exemption from the real estate 
transfer tax for transfers accomplished by transfer on death deeds. 
It explicitly applies the protection of the improvident transfers of title law to transfer 
on death deeds. It provides that a transfer on death deed can be interpreted as a transfer 
under the improvident transfers of title law when it is executed as well as when it is 
recorded, as both are opportunities for undue influence. It also confirms that all criminal 
and civil remedies are available against transfers of property unlawfully obtained through 
a transfer on death deed. 
It makes clear that the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, section 6-412 provides the 
details about the permissibility of inter vivos transfers of property even after a transfer on 
death deed is executed. 
It establishes that the beneficiary of a transfer on death deed may file for recording a 
notice of death affidavit with the registry of deeds where the transfer on death deed was 
recorded. This filing clarifies that ownership of the property is now held by the 
beneficiary. It requires the register of deeds to return the original notice of death affidavit 
to the person who filed it and mail a copy to the municipality in which the property is 
located. The filing of the notice of death affidavit is not a condition to the transfer of 
title.

1 It establishes the effective date of July 1, 2019. 
2 The amendment makes no changes to Article 7, except that it corrects application 
3 dates and removes unnecessary transition provisions. 
4 In Article 8, section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph F, the amendment changes 
5 "natural and adopting parents" to "former and adopting parents II to be consistent with 
6 changes to Article 9 and the Maine Parentage Act. 
7 The changes to Article 9 are based on the Family Law Advisory Commission's 
8 recommendations pursuant to Resolve 2015, chapter 73, section 3. The Family Law 
9 Advisory Commission submitted repotis to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary in 
10 January 2017 and January 2018. 
11 Several revisions to the Adoption Act are essential to ensure that it is consistent with 
12 the Maine Parentage Act, which became effective July 1, 2016. The current Adoption 
13 Act reflects a far more limited view of parentage than is now embodied in Maine family
