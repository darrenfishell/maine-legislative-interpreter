stages;

ratios from under the age of 3 to under the age of 4; 
5. Change the requirement that climbing equipment must be 6 feet from hard 
surfaces to requiring that it be located at a sufficient distance to prevent injury; 
6. Clarify that the 36-inch-high threshold for requiring energy-absorbing materials

the rubber tiles and mats used beneath the equipment must be approved by the American 
Society for Testing and Materials; 
7. Remove the requirement that the depth of energy-absorbing materials around
