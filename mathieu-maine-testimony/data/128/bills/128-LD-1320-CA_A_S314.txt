This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. Like the bill, the amendment 
sets up a structure to regulate the conduct of fantasy contests in the State. 
The bill requires fantasy contest operators to register with the Department of Public 
Safety and sets a registration fee of 10% of the fantasy contest operator's annual gross 
fantasy contest revenues not to exceed $5,000. The amendment requires the director of 
the Gambling Control Unit within the Department of Public Safety to oversee and 
administer the licensing and enforcement of the conduct of fantasy contests in the State. 
The amendment establishes an annual license fee of $2,500 for contest operators that 
receive $100,000 or more in gross fantasy contest revenue per year and authorizes the 
director of the Gambling Control Unit to set an application fee to cover the costs of 
administering the application process and conducting necessary background 
investigations. Fantasy contest operators that receive less than $100,000 in gross fantasy 
contest revenues are not required to pay the license fee but are subject to the application 
fee. The amendment establishes licensing criteria and conditions of licensure for the 
operators of fantasy contests and requires the director to adopt rules. 
The amendment requires a distribution of 10% of gross fantasy contest revenues of 
fantasy contest operators that receive revenues of $100,000 or more annually. Finally, 
the amendment provides that the laws governing unlawful gambling and games of chance 
do not apply to fantasy contest operators that comply with the laws governing fantasy 
contests.

fees are expected to result in a one-time Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $10,000 in fiscal year 2017-18, 
annual license fees are expected to generate annual Other Special Revenue Fund revenues of $5,000 starting in fiscal 
year 2017-18. The bill also requires fantasy contest operators with annual revenue greater than $100,000 to distribute 
10% of gross fantasy contest revenues to the General Fund. This distribution is estimated to increase General Fund
