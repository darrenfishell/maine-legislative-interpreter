SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
It replaces the bill. It removes the current requirement that the Governor approve salaries 
set by the Attorney General for the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, staff attorneys, 
assistant attorneys general and secretary to the Attorney General. Compensations 
continue to be limited by the total amount appropriated for those positions and cannot 
result in increases in requests in future budgets. 
The amendment gives the Attorney General the same authority within the Office of 
the Attorney General to approve financial orders as the Chief Justice has within the 
judicial branch. The Attorney General must provide a copy of each approved financial 
order to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of the Budget 
and the Office of Fiscal and Program Review.
