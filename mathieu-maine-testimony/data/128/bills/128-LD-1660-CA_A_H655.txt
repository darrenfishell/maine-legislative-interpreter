Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This resolve authorizes the State Tax Assessor to convey the interest of the State in several parcels of real estate in the 
Unorganized Territory (UT) acquired through the foreclosure of tax liens for nonpayment of property taxes. The 
funds received as a result of these sales will accrue as dedicated revenue to the Unorganized Territory Education and 
Services Fund and will be available to reduce future tax assessments in the UT. The amounts received from these 
sales will depend on sale prices and cannot be estimated at this time.
