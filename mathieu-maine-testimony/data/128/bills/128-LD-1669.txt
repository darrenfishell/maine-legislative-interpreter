Page 1 - 128LR2459(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §176-A, sub-§3,  ¶A, as amended by PL 2011, c. 380, Pt. J, 
3 §12, is further amended to read:
4 A.    Except  as otherwise provided in paragraph B, any person who is in possession 
5 of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy upon 
6 which a levy has been made shall,  upon demand of the assessor, surrender the 
7 property or rights or discharge the obligation to the assessor within 21 days after 
8 receipt of the notice of levy, except that part of the property or rights that is, at the 
9 time of the demand, subject to an attachment or execution under judicial  process.   It 
10 is a defense to the liability  imposed by this subsection that the person who fails to 
11 comply with the terms of a notice of levy or that person's  bailor  has a valid claim 
12 against the delinquent taxpayer that accrued prior to receipt of the notice of levy or a 
13 valid security interest or lien upon the property of the taxpayer that was perfected  
14 prior to receipt of the notice of levy; but this defense is available only to the extent  of 
15 that claim, security interest or lien.
16 Any financial institution  chartered  under state or federal law, including, but not 
17 limited to, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations,  national  
18 banks and credit unions, shall surrender to the assessor  any deposits, including any 
19 interest in the financial institution that would otherwise be required to be surrendered  
20 under this subsection only after 21 days after receipt of the notice of levy, but not 
21 later than 30 days after receipt of the notice of levy.  Except as provided in subsection  
22 5, paragraph D, with respect to a levy on salary or wages, any person in possession  
23 of, or obligated with respect to, property subject  to a continuing levy against 
24 intangible personal property, which property is first possessed or which obligation 
25 first arises subsequent to receipt of a notice of levy by that person, shall,  upon 
26 demand of the assessor, surrender the property or rights, or discharge  the obligation 
27 to the assessor  within 30 days after the property is first possessed or the obligation 
28 first arises.
29 Any financial institution  chartered  under state or federal law, including, but not 
30 limited to, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations,  national  
31 banks and credit unions,  shall surrender  to the assessor  any deposits subject  to levy 
32 for the payment of taxes pursuant to Part  8 in the following order: 
33 (1)  Deposits in accounts  held solely by the delinquent taxpayer;
34 (2)  Deposits in accounts held jointly  by the delinquent  taxpayer and the 
35 taxpayer’s spouse; and
36 (3)  Deposits in accounts  held jointly by the  delinquent taxpayer and  a 3rd party.
37 SUMMARY
38 This bill requires a financial institution,  in a case in which  a delinquent  taxpayer's 
39 accounts have been levied for unpaid state income taxes,  to satisfy the levy first from 
40 accounts held solely by the delinquent  taxpayer,  next from accounts held jointly by the 
Page 2 - 128LR2459(01)-11 delinquent taxpayer and the delinquent taxpayer's spouse and last from accounts held 
2 jointly by the delinquent  taxpayer and  a 3rd  party.
