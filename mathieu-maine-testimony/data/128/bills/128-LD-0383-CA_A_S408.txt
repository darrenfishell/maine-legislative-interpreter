19 rating system established pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 3737, 
20 subsection 3. The department is required to include stakeholders in the process of 
21 developing the plan, including those involved in the Quality for ME Revision Project. 
22 The plan must include determining whether sufficient funding in the federal child care 
23 and development fund block grant exists. It must examine federal and state statutory and 
24 regulatory frameworks to determine what is allowable, factors that present barriers and if 
25 the state child care and development fund plan must be amended. The plan must take 
26 into consideration reimbursement differentials, grant programs, contracts, professional 
27 development, child care and educational training programs and increased infant and 
28 toddler care to increase the supply of child care providers participating in steps 3 and 4. 
29 The plan must take into account geographic differences in access to quality child care in 
30 the State. The department must develop definitions of "disabilities" and "special needs" 
31 for infants and toddlers to be used in quality standards. The department is required to 
32 provide data on the numbers of children in need of care and child care providers by type, 
33 step on the child care quality rating system, geography, numbers served and capacity and
