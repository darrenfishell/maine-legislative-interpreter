Whereas, surgical procedures routinely require higher dosages than the current 
opioid limit laws allow and clarification to the law is necessary immediately; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment makes the following changes to 
the laws relating to the Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program and 
limits on opioid prescribing. 
I . In the laws governing the Palliative Care and Quality of Life Interdisciplinary 
Advisory Council, it changes the definition of "palliative care" to clarify that palliative 
care does not always include a requirement for hospice care or attention to spiritual needs 
and includes chronic, unremitting or intractable pain such as neuropathic pain as an 
example of"serious illness." 
2. It changes the definition of "dispenser" to remove health care professionals. 
3. It removes the requirement to submit to the Department of Health and Human 
Services information regarding a controlled substance that is dispensed by a hospital 
emergency department for use during a period of 48 hours or less. 
4. It adds to the list of individuals who can access the Controlled Substances 
Prescription Monitoring Program information the staff members of a group practice of 
prescribers who are authorized by a designated group practice leader, insofar as the 
information relates to a patient receiving care from that group practice.

5. It removes the requirement for a dispenser to notify the Controlled Substances 
Prescription Monitoring Program if the dispenser has reason to believe that a prescription 
is fraudulent or duplicative, maintaining the requirement that the dispenser contact the 
prescriber. 
6. It clarifies that the requirement to check the Controlled Substances Prescription 
Monitoring Program does not apply for surgical procedures, rather than only inpatient 
surgery. 
7. It clarifies that dispensing in connection with surgical procedures is exempt from 
the 100 morphine milligram equivalents limitation on opioids. 
8. It clarifies that an opioid product that is labeled by the federal Food and Drug 
Administration to be dispensed only in a stock bottle that exceeds a 7-day supply may be 
prescribed as long as the amount dispensed does not exceed a 14-day supply. 
9. It makes all rules related to the Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring 
Program major substantive rules except that the Department of Health and Human 
Services is directed to adopt routine technical rules to conform to the changes in the 
definition of "dispenser" and the removal of the requirement of a pharmacist to notify the 
program when a prescription appears fraudulent or duplicative.
