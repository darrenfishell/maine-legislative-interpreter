'Sec. 1. 24-A MRSA ยง2189 is enacted to read: 
ยง2189. Requirements related to enrollment in health plans

exchange or outside of the exchange shall pay a commission to a licensed insurance 
producer appointed by or contracted with the insurer for the enrollment of an individual

commission to a licensed insurance producer appointed by or contracted with the insurer

enrollment of the same individual or employee by the producer in a prior plan year during 
a special enrollment period.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/},to H.P. 267, L.D. 361 
1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. Like the bill, the amendment requires insurers that 
3 offer health plans in this State to pay commissions to licensed insurance producers for 
4 enrollments made during annual and special enrollment periods and to pay an equal 
5 commission for enrollments made during a special enrollment period. The amendment 
6 also prohibits an insurer from eliminating, restricting or limiting the payment of a 
7 commission to a producer for enrollment of an individual in a health plan during any 
8 annual enrollment period on the basis that the producer was not paid a commission for the 
9 enrollment of the same individual by the producer in a prior plan year during a special 
10 enrollment period. 
11 The amendment removes the provisions in the bill that require insurers to ensure that 
12 only licensed insurance producers and consultants enroll individuals and employees 
13 during special enrollment periods and that require that these insurance producers and 
14 consultants receive training to recognize potential cases of fraud, waste and abuse related 
15 to special enrollment periods. The amendment also removes references to licensed 
16 insurance consultants and clarifies that the requirements related to the payment of 
17 commissions apply when an insurance producer holds an appointment from or is 
18 contracted with the insurer. 
19 The amendment clarifies that the provisions apply to health plans issued or renewed 
20 on or after January 1, 2018.
