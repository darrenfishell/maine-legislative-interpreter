Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Increasing the legal age to purchase cigarettes and tobacco products from 18 to 21 is estimated to reduce General 
Fund revenue by $3,587,017 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $4,700,203 in fiscal year 2018-19 and reduce Local 
Government Fund revenue by $6,616 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $8,657 in fiscal year 2018-19. These impacts are to 
the cigarette tax, the tobacco products tax and the sales and use tax and assume a 3% decline in cigarette sales and a 
5% decline in tobacco product sales. 
The additional costs to the Depaiiment of Health and Human Services to update materials and resources are expected 
to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
