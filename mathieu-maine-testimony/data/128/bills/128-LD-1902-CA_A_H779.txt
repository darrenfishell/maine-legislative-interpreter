The required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of govemment to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $435,135 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Special Services Team 
program within the Department of Education for the costs associated with enhancing and upgrading the system of 
response to intervention and a review of the MaineCare billing systems and procedures as it relates to school 
administrative units (SAU's) billing for medically necessary services.
