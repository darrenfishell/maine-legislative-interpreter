Occupational Regulation in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, chapter 901. 
The amendment adds a provision repealing the statute establishing licensure of 
appraisal management companies on March 15, 2018. The Board of Real Estate 
Appraisers is required to submit a repo1t to the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, 
Commerce, Research and Economic Development by January 1, 2018 indicating whether
