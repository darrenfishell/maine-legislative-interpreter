 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20 -A, sections 1490 and 1501 to 3 
1505, a regional s chool unit is authorized to issue general obligation bonds and notes for 4 
school construction projects and minor capital costs; and  5 
Whereas, following a public hearing held on December 7, 2016, at a referendum 6 
held January  10, 2017, the voters of Regional S chool Unit No. 5 approved 2 articles that 7 
authorize the regional school unit to construct a synthetic track and field project at an 8 
aggregate cost of up to $4,395,124 and to pay a portion of the project costs by acceptance 9 
of over $2,250,000 in gifts, with  the balance of project costs to be derived from other 10 
funds, including the issuance of bonds or notes; and  11 
Whereas, the track and field project has been put out to bid for construction; and  12 
Whereas, pursuant to the referendum vote, Regional School Unit No . 5 plans to 13 
issue up to $1,538,065 in new general obligation bonds to finance the balance of the 14 
project not funded by gifts or other available funds; and  15 
Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20 -A, section 1502, subsection 1, 16 
paragraph C requires a regional school unit to hold a public hearing before a referendum 17 
election and to give notification of the public hearing by posting a notice at least 7 days 18 
prior to the date of the public hearing; and  19 
Whereas, following the referendum held for the track and field project, Regional 20 
School Unit No. 5 discovered that the notice for the public hearing had been inadvertently  21 
posted for only 6 days prior to the hearing; and  22 
Whereas, the untimely posting of the public hearing notice has created a legal 23 
technica lity that affects the marketability of the bonds that Regional School Unit No. 5 24 
voters have approved for issuance; and  25 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 26 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require  the following legislation as 27 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 28 
therefore,  29 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  30 
Sec. 1.  Validation and authorization.  Notwithstanding any other  provision of 31

public hearing, are validated and made effective.  34

legislation takes effect when approved.  36

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill validates the referendum votes of Regional School Unit No. 5 conducted on 2 
January 10, 2017 to authorize gifts and other funding sources, including bo nds, for a track 3 
and field project.  Regional School Unit No. 5 conducted a public hearing on December 4 
7, 2016, prior to that referendum.  The regional school unit provided notification of the 5 
public hearing by posting a notice of public hearing in each to wn for 6 days prior to the 6 
hearing, instead of 7 days prior to the public hearing as required by law, which created a 7 
legal technicality that affects the marketability of the bonds to be issued for the track and 8 
field project in Regional School Unit No. 5.  9
