9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 382, L.D. 1161, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend the Insurance Laws Governing the Provision of Rebates" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 1Sec. 1. 24-A MR.SA ยง2163-A, as amended by PL 1999, c. 8, ยง1, is repealed and 
14 the following enacted in its place:

19 the cost does not exceed $100 per year per person, and conduct raffles or drawings, as 
20 long as there is no participation cost to entrants and as long as the prizes are not valued in 
21 excess of $500. Nothing in sections 2160 to 2163 may be construed to prohibit an 
22 insurance producer from receiving a fee rather than commission on the sale of property 
23 and casualty insurance in accordance with section 1450 and rules adopted by the 
24 superintendent. 
25 Gifts and prizes given pursuant to this section may not be in the form of cash. 
26 2. Permissible value-added service or activity. An insurer, an employee of an 
27 insurer or a producer may offer to provide a value-added service or activity, offered or 
28 provided without fee or at a reduced fee, that is related to the coverage provided by an 
29 insurance contract if the provision of the value-added service or activity does not violate 
30 any other applicable statute or rule and is: 
31 A. Clearly identified and included within the insurance contract; or 
32 B. Directly related to the servicing of the insurance contract or offered or undertaken 
33 to provide risk control for the benefit of a client. 
34 3. Services for free or for less than fair market value. This section does not

11 SUMMARY 
12 This amendment is the majority report of the committee and replaces the bill. This 
13 amendment retains the provision in the bill allowing a person to offer or provide services, 
14 whether or not the services are directly related to an insurance contract, for free or for less 
15 than fair market value, as long as the receipt of the services is not contingent upon the 
16 purchase of insurance and the recipient of the services is notified in writing that the 
17 services are not contingent on the purchase of insurance. The amendment also increases 
18 the dollar limits for permissible gifts in connection with marketing and retention of 
19 contracts from $20 per person to $100 per person and increases the maximum value of 
20 prizes awarded in raffles and drawings from $100 to $500.
