SUMMARY  28 
This bill amends the Child and Family Services and Child Protection Act in several 29 
ways.  30 
1.  The bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from 31 
discrimina ting against parents who engage in nontraditional methods of parenting when 32 
the department determines whether to take any child protective actions and in 33 
determining what actions to take.  34 
 
 Page 6 - 128LR1874(01) -1 
 2.  The bill requires the court to give appropriate weight to the im portance of 1 
maintaining the familial bond connecting the child and the relative requesting placement 2 
when determining the best interests of the child.  3 
3.  The bill requires the department to share confidential records with a person one or 4 
both parents desi gnate as a participant.  5 
4.  The bill clarifies that the restrictions on the release of confidential information do 6 
not prohibit a parent, other family member, participant or caretaker of a child from 7 
sharing any information about the child, the family or t he circumstances involving the 8 
child that is the subject of an investigation or proceeding under this Act as long as the 9 
information shared was not obtained by the parent, other family member, participant or 10 
caretaker from confidential records of the depar tment.  11 
5.  The bill requires the department to develop a roster of appropriate professionals 12 
capable and appropriately credentialed to investigate, interview or provide expert 13 
testimony that may be admissible in a proceeding under this Act.  At the request  of a 14 
parent, the court is required to order a professional on the roster to investigate, interview 15 
or provide expert testimony in addition to any investigation, interview or expert 16 
testimony provided by one or more persons already involved by the departme nt.  The 17 
State is responsible for paying the costs of the additional expert's services.  18 
6.  The bill amends the law concerning rehabilitation and reunification plans to 19 
ensure that the department provide or make available any services the department 20 
identi fies as necessary for a parent to receive and complete to be reunited with the child.  21 
If the department fails to provide or make those services available, the department is 22 
required to report the failure to the court, and the court will extend the time wi thin which 23 
the parent is required to meet the requirements of the plan.  Related to the failure of the 24 
department to provide or make available the identified services is the adjustment to the 25 
calculation of the time the child is considered in foster care f or the purpose of triggering 26 
the termination of parental rights.  The period of time during which the department is 27 
required to provide or make available services but fails to do so is not included in the 28 
time the child is considered in foster care.  29 
7.  Cu rrent law provides that the department may file a termination of parental rights 30 
petition when the child has been in foster care for at least 15 of the most recent 22 31 
months.  The bill extends those periods to 24 months and 30 months, respectively.  32 
8.  The  bill provides an opportunity for a parent who has been convicted of a crime to 33 
show the rehabilitative steps taken to address the underlying criminal behavior, and thus 34 
rebut the presumption favoring termination of parental rights.  35
