 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to create a process to quantitatively evaluate competitive bids for 5 
state contracts in terms of the total economic value to the State. The process established 6 
by this bill would apply to state service contracts expected to exceed $100,000 in total 7 
value and would include scoring criteria that evaluate the economic impact of the 8 
proposer's bid on the state economy and state revenues. In evaluating economic impact, 9 
the process would use economic multipliers to measure the impact of the use of raw 10 
materials from in -state sources, the employment of state residents and the use of in -state 11 
vendors, consulta nts and subcontractors. The process established by the bill will be 12 
consistent with the terms of Executive Order 2012 -004, An Order Directing Certain 13 
Evaluation Criteria in Competitive Bidding.  14
