This bill establishes the Retail Marijuana Regulatory Coordination Fund within the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services (DAFS). It provides for a $1,100,000 transfer from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund 
in fiscal year 2016-17 to the fund and includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $1, 100,000 in fiscal year 
2016-17 for use by the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) within DAFS and the 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) to conduct rulemaking, enter into contracts with 
consultants, hire staff and implement other activities of this bill. The BAB LO is assigned as the state licensing 
authority for retail purposes under the Marijuana Legalization Act. The bill retains the DACF as the state licensing 
authority for agricultural purposes under the Act. It directs both departments to adopt rules to implement the amended 
provisions of the Marijuana Legalization Act. 
The bill also includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $500,000 in 2016-17 to the Legislature to provide 
resources for the Joint Select Committee on Marijuana Legalization Implementation for the costs of consultant 
services and necessary travel and expenses and any other purposes determined to be appropriate to assist the 
committee in the perfonnance of its duties. 
Both BABLO and DACF have indicated that additional positions are required to implement the provisions of the bill. 
Additional appropriations or allocations may be required in the intermediary period between this bill and the full 
program implementation of marijuana legalization.
