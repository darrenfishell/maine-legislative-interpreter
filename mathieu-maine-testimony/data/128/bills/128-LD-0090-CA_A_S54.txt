30 referenda consistent with this section as long as the referenda are held within one year 
31 after the effective date of this Act.' 
32 SUMMARY 
33 This amendment is the majority report of the committee, and it strikes and replaces 
34 the bill. The amendment also removes the emergency status from the bill. It allows the 
35 trustees of the Rumford Water District to submit to the legal voters of the district the 
36 question of whether the charter for the district should be amended to require that the legal 
3 7 voters of the district elect trustees, instead of having trustees appointed by the municipal 
3 8 officers as the chmier currently requires. This amendment specifies that if a referendum is 
39 called it must be called, advertised and conducted according to the law relating to 
40 municipal elections. If the referendum is called and a majority of the legal voters vote to 
41 change the chmier to allow for the election of district trustees, the amendment contains 
42 transition language that allows the currently serving appointed trustees to finish out their
