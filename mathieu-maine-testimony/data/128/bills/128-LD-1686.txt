Page 1 - 128LR2538(01)-11 Emergency preamble. Whereas,  acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the Public Utilities  Commission has recently changed the rules governing 
4 net energy  billing in a  way  that penalizes self-generation; and
5 Whereas, the costs and complexities of implementing  these rule changes are 
6 disruptive to consumers; and
7 Whereas, passage of this Act as emergency legislation will avoid the 
8 implementation of the  most costly  and complex provision of the  amended rules; and
9 Whereas, recent outages  of electric power  have demonstrated the need for 
10 predictable and  fair distributed energy generation policy;  and
11 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
12 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
13 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
14 therefore,
15 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
16 Sec. 1.  35-A  MRSA ยง3209-A, as corrected by RR 2017, c. 1, ยง32, is repealed and 
17 the following enacted  in its  place:
18 ยง3209-A.  Net energy billing
19 An eligible customer may participate in net energy billing in accordance with this 
20 section.
21 1.  Definitions.   As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
22 following terms  have the following  meanings.
23 A.  "Eligible  customer" means a person that obtains  electricity service through a 
24 transmission and distribution utility and that owns  or has an interest  in an eligible  
25 facility located in that  transmission and  distribution utility's service territory.
26 B.  "Eligible  facility" means an electric  energy  generating facility that meets  
27 eligibility requirements established by the commission by rule pursuant to subsection 
28 4.
29 C.  "Excess energy generation" means the amount of kilowatt -hours exported by an 
30 eligible customer from an eligible facility to the transmission and distribution system 
31 over a billing period that is greater than the amount  of kilowatt-hours delivered by the 
32 transmission and distribution  utility to that eligible  customer over that same billing 
33 period.
34 D.  "Gross output" means all of the energy  generated by an eligible facility during an 
35 applicable period, including all energy that is used to offset the usage of eligible 
36 customers.
Page 2 - 128LR2538(01)-11 E.  "Net energy" means the difference between the kilowatt-hours delivered  by the 
2 transmission and distribution utility to an eligible customer over a billing period and 
3 the kilowatt- hours  exported  by that customer from an eligible  facility to the 
4 transmission and distribution system over  the same billing period.
5 F.  "Net energy billing"  means a billing and metering practice under which an eligible  
6 customer is  billed on the basis of net energy.
7 G.  "Shared interest" means an interest in an eligible facility shared by multiple 
8 eligible customers  that have distinct billing  accounts with a transmission and 
9 distribution utility.
10 H.  "Transmission and distribution bill" means an eligible customer's bill, over a 
11 billing period, for transmission and distribution  utility service.
12 2.  Prohibition on gross output.  A transmission and distribution utility may not 
13 require an eligible customer to meter  the gross  output of an eligible facility in order to 
14 participate in net  energy  billing.
15 3.  Limit on accounts.  The number  of eligible customers that participate in net 
16 energy billing  through a shared  interest or the number  of meters associated with a shared 
17 interest may not exceed 50, except that the number of eligible customers or meters is 
18 limited to 10 for a shared interest  in an eligible facility  located in the service territory of a 
19 transmission and distribution  utility located in an area administered  by the independent 
20 system administrator for northern Maine  or any successor of the independent system 
21 administrator for northern Maine unless the commission determines that the utility's 
22 billing system can accommodate  more than 10 accounts  or meters  for the purpose  of net 
23 energy billing.
24 4.  Rules.   The commission shall adopt rules governing net energy  billing to 
25 implement this section.   The rules must apply the following percentages  to the excess 
26 energy generation  that may be applied against an eligible customer's transmission and 
27 distribution bill for  the purposes  of net energy billing:
28 A.  Ninety percent  for an eligible customer that applies for a net energy billing 
29 arrangement after April 30, 2018 and before May 1, 2019;
30 B.  Eighty percent for an eligible customer that applies for a net energy billing 
31 arrangement after April 30, 2019 and before May 1, 2020; and
32 C.  Seventy percent for an eligible customer that applies for net energy billing 
33 arrangement after April 30, 2020 and before May 1, 2021.
34 For each 12-month period  beginning after April  30, 2021, the commission by rule must  
35 reduce the percentage of an eligible customer's excess  energy generation that may be 
36 applied against that customer's transmission and distribution bill for the purpose of net 
37 energy billing by no more than 10%.  During each such year,  the reduction in the 
38 percentage of an eligible  customer's  excess  energy  generation that may be applied  against  
39 that customer's transmission and distribution  bill applies only to customers that apply for 
40 a net energy billing arrangement in that  12-month period.
Page 3 - 128LR2538(01)-11 The rules must  specify that an eligible customer that applies for a net energy billing 
2 arrangement before May 1, 2018  may continue with the net energy billing  arrangement  
3 until April 30, 2033 and that an eligible customer that applies for a net energy billing 
4 arrangement after April 30, 2018 may continue with that net energy  billing arrangement 
5 until April 30th of the calendar year that is 15 years from the year in which  the customer 
6 applied for the net  energy billing  arrangement.
7 Rules adopted or amended  under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in 
8 Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
9 Sec. 2.  Report.   The Public Utilities Commission shall  submit a report  to the joint 
10 standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction  over utilities and energy  
11 matters by January  1, 2020 that includes recommendations on how to transition from  net 
12 energy billing as governed by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3209-A to 
13 time-of -use rates,  market-based  rates or other  rate designs.  The commission shall submit 
14 information in its  report on how its  recommendations:
15 1.  Promote  distributed energy generation resources  while supporting equitable 
16 treatment of  all customers and application  of cost causation principles  in rate design;
17 2.  Integrate distributed energy generation resources to increase efficiency  of the 
18 electric grid while  reducing costs for all ratepayers;
19 3.  Use capabilities such as advanced  metering  investments by transmission and 
20 distribution utilities to track exports to the grid and usage and to provide  actionable price  
21 signals to all customers, including those  with distributed energy resources; and
22 4.  Encourage integration of and compensation for small-scale  distributed energy 
23 resources in the regional markets.
24 The Public Utilities Commission shall conduct and include in its report an analysis of 
25 the costs and benefits to ratepayers from  net energy billing  in an adjudicatory  proceeding.  
26 The analysis must include all identifiable costs and benefits for net energy  billing  
27 participants and nonparticipants,  including but not limited  to the costs and benefits 
28 described in Public  Law 2013, chapter 562, section 2.  The analysis must at a minimum 
29 consider costs and benefits over a 10-year period  and a 25-year period.  If uncertainty 
30 exists with regard to a future cost or benefit, the commission shall use assumptions for 
31 what it considers the most likely higher -value and lower -value scenarios.  For any 
32 recommendation made in the report, the commission shall  quantify or estimate how the 
33 recommended action would increase  or decrease costs to ratepayers over both the short 
34 term and the long term and how it is likely to affect solar  installations.   The commission 
35 shall address how the effect of the recommendation  compares to the current net energy 
36 billing practice in terms  of the effect on ratepayers and on the rate at which 
37 customer- sited solar  photovoltaic installations are occurring  in the State.
38 In considering rate design options, the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation 
39 with solar installers, transmission and distribution utilities, the Governor's Energy Office 
40 and the Public Advocate,  shall compile the best available data on the energy production 
41 from customer-sited solar photovoltaic installations  or other distributed energy generation 
Page 4 - 128LR2538(01)-11 resources in this State and on electricity  usage by customers with customer-sited  solar 
2 photovoltaic installations  or other distributed energy generation resources.
3 The Public Utilities Commission  shall  also examine  and report on market-based 
4 procurement programs for community  solar  projects and how such a program  can be 
5 structured to provide benefits to ratepayers while  encouraging community- based  solar  
6 photovoltaic installations.
7 At least 60 days before submitting the report  under this section to the joint standing 
8 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities  and energy matters,  the 
9 Public Utilities Commission shall  post the report on its publicly accessible website.   
10 Within that period of time,  a member of the public may submit to the commission written 
11 comments regarding the report.  The commission shall submit all comments received 
12 with the report  to the  committee.
13 The joint standing committee of the Legislature  having jurisdiction over utilities and 
14 energy matters  may report out a bill based on the Public Utilities Commission's  
15 recommendations to the Second Regular Session of the 129th  Legislature.
16 Sec. 3.  Rules.  The Public Utilities Commission shall  amend its net energy billing 
17 rules before January  1, 2019 to be consistent  with the Maine  Revised  Statutes,  Title  35-A, 
18 section 3209-A.
19 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
20 legislation takes effect when  approved.
21 SUMMARY
22 This bill requires  a net energy billing customer that applies for a net energy billing 
23 arrangement after April  30, 2018 but before May 1, 2019  to receive 90% of the excess 
24 energy generation from an eligible facility to be applied  against  the customer's 
25 transmission and distribution  bill, a customer that applies for a net energy billing  
26 arrangement after April  30, 2019 but before May 1, 2020  to receive 80% of the excess 
27 energy generation from an eligible facility to be applied  against  the customer's 
28 transmission and distribution  bill and a customer that applies for a net energy billing 
29 arrangement after April  30, 2020 but before May 1, 2021  to receive 70% of the excess 
30 energy generation from an eligible facility to be applied  against  the customer's 
31 transmission and distribution bill.  It requires that in each 12-month period  after April 30, 
32 2021, the percentage of an eligible customer's  excess energy generation that applies to 
33 that customer's transmission and distribution bill be reduced by no more than 10% and 
34 that any reduction applies  only to customers that apply  for a net energy  billing 
35 arrangement in that 12-month  period.   It specifies  that an eligible customer  that applies  
36 for a net energy billing arrangement before May 1, 2018 may continue with the net 
37 energy billing  arrangement  until April  30, 2033 and that an eligible  customer  that applies 
38 for a net energy billing  arrangement after April 30, 2018 may continue with that net 
39 energy billing arrangement  until April  30th of the calendar year that is 15 years from the 
40 year in which the customer applied for the net  energy  billing  arrangement.
Page 5 - 128LR2538(01)-11 This bill prohibits a transmission and distribution utility  from requiring  a customer to 
2 meter the gross output of an eligible facility  in order  to participate in net energy billing.  
3 It limits to 50 the number  of eligible customers that may participate in a single  shared  
4 interest in an eligible facility  or the number  of meters associated with a single  shared 
5 interest, except  in the service territory of a transmission and distribution  utility located in 
6 an area administered by the independent system administrator for northern  Maine. It 
7 requires the Public Utilities Commission to amend its current net energy billing rules  
8 before January 1, 2019 to be consistent with the Maine  Revised Statutes, Title  35-A, 
9 section 3209-A.
10 This bill also requires  the Public  Utilities Commission to submit a report  by January  
11 1, 2020 that includes recommendations on how to transition from net energy billing to 
12 time-of -use rates, market- based rates or other rate design  options.  In its report, the 
13 commission must include information regarding an analysis of costs and benefits of net 
14 energy billing  as well as how those costs and benefits compare to any recommendations 
15 the commission  makes in this report.
