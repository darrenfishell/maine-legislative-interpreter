11 COMMIITEE AMENDMENT ''A "to H.P. 525, L.D. 745 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, elevates from Class 
B to Class A the new crime of performing female genital mutilation on a female person 
under 18 years of ag~. The amendment reduces from a Class B to a Class C crime the 
first offense of a pare~t, guardian or custodian of the female person under 18 years of age 
in consenting to or permitting the procedure but retains as a Class B crime any 
subsequent offenses. The amendment provides a defense to the new crime of female 
genital mutilation that, when the procedure was consented to or petmitted by a parent, 
guardian or custodian of a female person under 18 years of age, the parent, guardian or 
custodian was compelled to consent to or permit the procedure by force or by threat of 
death or bodily injury to that person or another person.
