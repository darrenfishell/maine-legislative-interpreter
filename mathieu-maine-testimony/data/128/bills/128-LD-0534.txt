 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3025, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 420, Pt. D, §2 and 2 
affected by §6, is further amended to read:  3 
1.  Circumstances of death that must be reported.   A medical examiner cas e may 4 
exist and must be reported as provided in section 3026 when remains are found that may 5 
be human and raise suspicion that death has occurred under any of the following 6 
circumstances:  7 
A.  Death is suspected of having been caused by any type of physica l injury, 8 
including poisoning, regardless of whether the suspected manner of death is 9 
homicide, suicide or accident.  This circumstance must be reported irrespective of 10 
whether the deceased had been attended by a physician, was a patient in a hospital, 11 
survived for a considerable time following the physical injury or died from terminal 12 
natural causes consequent to and following the physical injury;  13 
B.  Suddenly when the person is in apparent good health and has no specific natural 14 
disease sufficient to expl ain death;  15 
C.  During diagnostic or therapeutic procedures under circumstances indicating gross 16 
negligence or when clearly due to trauma or poisoning unrelated to the ordinary risks 17 
of those procedures;  18 
D.  Death when the person is in custody pursuant to a n arrest, confined in a state 19 
correctional or detention facility, county jail, other county correctional or detention 20 
facility or local lockup or is on the way to or from a courthouse or any of these places 21 
while in the custody of a law enforcement officer  or county or state corrections 22 
official;  23 
E.  Death while the person is a patient or resident of a facility of the Department of 24 
Health and Human Services or residential care facility maintained or licensed by the 25 
Department of Health and Human Services, u nless clearly certifiable by an attending 26 
physician as due to specific natural causes;  27 
F.  Death suspected of being due to a threat to the public health when the authority of 28 
the medical examiner is needed to adequately study the case for the protection of  the 29 
public health;  30 
G.  Death suspected of not having been certified, including, but not limited to, bodies 31 
brought into the State and any buried remains uncovered other than by legal 32 
exhumation;  33 
H.  Deaths suspected of being medical examiner cases which m ay have been 34 
improperly certified or inadequately examined, including, but not limited to, bodies 35 
brought into the State under those circumstances;  36 
I.  Sudden infant death syndrome deaths and all other deaths of children under the age 37 
of 18 unless clearly certifiable by an attending physician as due to specific natural 38

or disposed of, for which the responsibility to do so cannot be readily  determined; or  41 
 
 Page 2 - 128LR0683(01) -1 
 K.  Any cause when there is no attending physician capable of certifying the death as 1 
due to natural causes. When a person dies who is under the care of a religious 2 
practitioner who uses prayer and spiritual means of healing, the fact that the deceased 3 
has been under such religious care does not warrant suspicion of foul play or 4 
investigation beyond that warranted by the other facts of the case.  5 
In the absence of any of the circumstances outlined in this section, the fact that a patient 6 
dies within 24 hours of admission to a hospital or other health care facility need not be 7 
reported to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner.  8 
In any case in which the necessity of a report is questionable, a report must be made.  9 
Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3025, sub -§1-A, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 433, §4, is 10 
amended to read:  11 
A.    Deaths due to the consequences of long-term alcohol use,  long-term exposure to 12 
environmental or occupational toxins or long -term exposure to carcinogens;  13
