This bill establishes the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Act within the Commission on Governmental 
Ethics and Election Practices and provides for annual transfers of $3,000,000 from certain General Fund revenues to 
the Maine Citizens' Initiatives Clean Election Fund (the Fund) beginning in fiscal year 2017-18. The bill includes 
ongoing allocations to the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices of $3, 000, 000 beginning in 
fiscal year 2017-18 to allow expenditures from the Fund. In addition to the annual transfers, the Fund may also 
receive revenue from qualifying contributions raised by committees and voluntary contributions through a tax 
checkoff program. Committees that are Maine-chartered nonprofits or groups would be able to use a public financing 
mechanism to support or oppose a citizens' initiative ballot question. This public financing process is similar to the 
Maine Clean Election Act for candidates. Committees would need to raise specific amounts of qualified contributions 
in order to qualify for funding.
