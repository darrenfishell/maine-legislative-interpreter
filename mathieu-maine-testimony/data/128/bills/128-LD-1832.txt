Page 1 - 128LR2890(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  1 MRSA  ยง403-A  is enacted to read:
3 ยง403-A.  Remote participation in public proceedings
4 It is the intent of the Legislature that actions of bodies subject to this subchapter be 
5 taken openly and their deliberations be conducted openly.  This section governs 
6 participation in a public  proceeding of such a body by a member of that body when the 
7 member is not physically present.  Remote participation,  which means participation  
8 through telephonic,  video,  electronic or other  similar  means of communication may not 
9 be used to defeat  the purposes of this subchapter as stated in section 401.  The Legislature 
10 may not allow its members  to participate  remotely in public proceedings of the 
11 Legislature.
12 1.  Remote participation; requirements.  Except  as provided in subsection  2, a 
13 body subject to this subchapter may not allow  a member of the body to participate  
14 remotely in any of its public  proceedings unless the participation  is in accordance with 
15 this subchapter and:
16 A.  After notice  and public hearing,  the body has adopted a written  policy or rule that 
17 authorizes a member of the body who is not physically present to participate in a 
18 public proceeding  of that body in a manner that allows all members to simultaneously 
19 hear and speak to each other  during the public proceeding and allows members  of the 
20 public attending the public proceeding at the location  identified in the notice required 
21 by section 406 to hear all members of the body.  If the policy allows remote  
22 participation in executive sessions, the policy must establish procedures and 
23 requirements that ensure the privacy of  the executive session;
24 B.  A quorum is physically present at the location identified in the notice required by 
25 section 406, unless  immediate action is imperative  and physical presence of a quorum 
26 is not reasonably practicable within the period of time in which action  must be taken.  
27 The determination that a quorum  is not required under this paragraph must be made  
28 by the presiding  officer  of the body and the facts supporting that determination must 
29 be included in the record  of the meeting.  A body may not consider  matters  other than 
30 those requiring immediate  action in a public proceeding held pursuant to this 
31 subsection when a  quorum  is not physically present;
32 C.  Each member of the body  who is participating  in the public proceeding remotely  
33 identifies for the record all persons present at the location from  which the member is 
34 participating.  The member  shall note for the record when any person  enters  or leaves 
35 the location throughout  the course  of the public proceeding;
36 D.  All votes taken during the public proceeding are taken  by roll call;
37 E.  A member of the body who is not physically present at the location identified in 
38 the notice  required by section 406 does not participate and does not vote in an 
39 adjudicatory proceeding; and
40 F.  Each member of the body who is participating in the public  proceeding remotely 
41 receives any documents or other materials presented or discussed at the public 
Page 2 - 128LR2890(01)-11 proceeding in advance  or when made available at the public proceeding  if the 
2 transmission technology  is available.  Failure to comply with this subsection  does not 
3 invalidate an action  of the  body.
4 2.  Exceptions.  The following bodies  are exempt from the provisions of this section 
5 and a member of the following  bodies  may participate in a public  proceeding of the body 
6 when the member is not physically present:
7 A.  The  Finance  Authority of Maine, as  provided  in Title 10, section  971;
8 B.  The Commission  on Governmental Ethics  and Election Practices, as provided in 
9 Title 21-A, section 1002, subsection 2;
10 C.  The Maine Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, as provided in 
11 Title 22, section 2054, subsection 4;
12 D.  The Maine State  Housing Authority,  as provided in Title 30-A, section  4723, 
13 subsection 2, paragraph  B;
14 E.  The Maine Municipal  Bond Bank, as provided in Title 30-A, section 5951, 
15 subsection 4;
16 F.  The Emergency  Medical Services' Board, as provided  in Title  32, section  88, 
17 subsection 1, paragraph  D; and
18 G.  The Workers' Compensation Board,  as provided in Title  39-A, section 151, 
19 subsection 5.
20 SUMMARY
21 This bill implements the recommendation  of the Right To Know Advisory 
22 Committee to clarify  when  members  of public bodies may participate remotely  in public 
23 proceedings of those bodies.  The bill prohibits  a body subject to the Freedom  of Access 
24 Act from allowing its members  to participate in its public proceedings through  
25 telephonic, video,  electronic or other similar means of communication unless the body 
26 has adopted a written  policy that authorizes remote participation in a manner that allows 
27 all members to simultaneously  hear and speak  to each other  during the public proceeding 
28 and allows members of the public  attending the public  proceeding at the location 
29 identified in the meeting  notice  to hear all members of the body.  If the policy allows 
30 remote participation in executive sessions, the policy must establish  procedures and 
31 requirements that ensure the privacy  of the executive session.  The bill requires a quorum 
32 of the body to be physically present at the location  identified in the meeting  notice unless 
33 immediate action is imperative and physical presence of a quorum  is not reasonably 
34 practicable within  the period of time requiring action.   The bill requires that each member 
35 participating remotely identify all persons present at the remote location, that all votes be 
36 taken by roll call and that members  participating  remotely receive  documents or other 
37 materials presented or discussed at the public proceeding  in advance  or when made 
38 available at the meeting, if the technology is available.  The bill prohibits members  who 
39 are not physically present at the meeting location from  participating and voting in 
40 adjudicatory proceedings. 
Page 3 - 128LR2890(01)-11 The bill prohibits the Legislature from allowing its members to participate  in its 
2 public proceedings  through telephonic, video,  electronic or other similar means of 
3 communication, but allows  the Finance Authority of Maine,  the Commission  on 
4 Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, the Maine Health and Higher Educational 
5 Facilities Authority,  the Maine State Housing  Authority, the Maine Municipal Bond 
6 Bank, the Emergency Medical Services'  Board and the Workers' Compensation Board to 
7 continue allowing remote participation at their public proceedings as currently authorized 
8 in law.
