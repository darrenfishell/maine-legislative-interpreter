Page 1 - 128LR2983(01)-11 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
2 Sec. 1.  36 MRSA  ยง575-A,  sub-ยง3  is enacted  to read:
3 3.  Review of forest management and harvest plan  by Bureau of Forestry.  The 
4 Director of the Bureau of Forestry within the Department  of Agriculture, Conservation  
5 and Forestry, referred to in this subsection as "the forestry bureau," is authorized to 
6 initiate a review of the forest  management and harvest plan of any parcel enrolled under  
7 this subchapter for which  there  is no apparent evidence  of timber harvesting within  the 
8 previous 20 years,  based on notifications of harvesting received by the forestry bureau  
9 under Title 12, section  8883- B, to determine  whether the plan complies with this 
10 subchapter.  The director shall  notify  the owner of any parcel that the forestry bureau 
11 intends to review for compliance under this subsection  at least 15 days prior  to initiation 
12 of the review.
13 A.  The director of the forestry  bureau  shall  limit reviews authorized under  this 
14 subsection to parcels for which there is a difference between the valuation under this 
15 subchapter and just value of at least 25% or parcels for which an assessor requests  a 
16 review.
17 B.  For the purposes of reviews  authorized  under this subsection, the director of the 
18 forestry bureau or the director's designee  may:
19 (1) With prior written notification  to the landowner, enter and examine forest  
20 land for the purpose of determining compliance with the forest  management and 
21 harvest plan required under section 574- B;
22 (2) Request and review a forest  management and harvest  plan required under  
23 section 574-B, which must be provided by a landowner  or the landowner's agent 
24 upon request; and
25 (3) Request  and review an expired forest management and harvest plan,  which 
26 must be provided by a landowner  or the landowner's agent upon request.
27 C.  If the forestry bureau determines, within one year after initiating a review under  
28 this subsection, that a landowner is not in compliance  with this subchapter or that a 
29 parcel is not being managed in compliance with a plan developed under section 
30 574-B, subsection 1, the forestry bureau shall  provide notice of its determination to 
31 the landowner, the assessor and the forester  who prepared or reviewed and certified 
32 the plan. With this notice, the forestry  bureau  shall  provide to the landowner the 
33 reasons that the landowner  is determined to be in noncompliance and a list of 
34 consulting foresters and shall offer  the assistance of the forestry bureau in achieving 
35 compliance. The landowner has 180 days to come into compliance with this 
36 subchapter and 18 months to bring  the parcel into compliance with the plan. If the 
37 landowner does not come  into compliance with this subchapter within 180 days or 
38 does not come  into compliance with the plan within 18 months, the forestry bureau 
39 shall report that finding  of noncompliance  to the  landowner and  the assessor.
40 A forest management and harvest  plan provided to the director of the forestry bureau or 
41 the director's designee under this subsection is confidential and is not a public record as 
42 defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 3, except that the director may publish  at least 
Page 2 - 128LR2983(01)-11 one summary report annually,  which  may not reveal  the activities  of any person and 
2 which must be available  as a public  record.
3 Except when requested by the landowner or a transfer of the property occurs, the assessor 
4 may not withdraw  a parcel from tree growth  classification while  it is under  review  
5 pursuant to this subsection.  An assessor may not unreasonably deny  a request  to transfer 
6 a parcel reviewed by the forestry bureau to classification as farmland or open space  land 
7 under subchapter 10.
8 No later than March 1st of odd-numbered years  beginning in 2019, the forestry bureau 
9 shall issue a report to the joint standing committee  of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
10 over taxation  matters that summarizes the activities  of the forestry bureau  with regard to 
11 reviews of  parcels conducted  pursuant to this subsection.
12 SUMMARY
13 This bill makes the  following changes  to the Maine Tree Growth  Tax Law.
14 1. It authorizes the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of 
15 Forestry to review certain parcels of land classified  under the Maine Tree Growth  Tax 
16 Law to determine  whether  the landowner  is complying with the requirements  of the law 
17 and whether the land is being managed  in compliance  with the forest  management and 
18 harvest plan for that parcel.  The bureau  is required to report  any noncompliance after a 
19 specified period to the assessor. The owner of a parcel found by the forestry bureau to be 
20 in noncompliance with the law may apply to reclassify the parcel as farmland or open 
21 space under the  farm and open space tax law.
22 2. It requires  the bureau to offer assistance  to landowners found in noncompliance.
