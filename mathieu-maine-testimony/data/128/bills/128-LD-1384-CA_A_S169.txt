Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the provisions of the bill that remove the requirement to print 
a space on state ballots for undeclared write-in candidates. It also strikes the provision in 
the bill that removes the option for a party to determine who may participate in the party's 
primary. The bill prohibits a voter from changing enrollment or withdrawing enrollment 
in a party on election day. The amendment provides that a voter may change or withdraw 
enrollment on election day, but the application to do so is not deemed received until the 
next business day. The amendment specifies that a municipality may charge a rental fee 
or janitorial service fee when the municipality provides space for a local caucus to meet. 
The amendment strikes a provision governing notarial acts related to petitions for a direct 
initiative of legislation and a people's veto referendum. Finally, the amendment provides 
that the deadline for filing municipal nomination papers is the 60th day prior to election, 
rather than the 70th day prior to election that is proposed in the bill.
