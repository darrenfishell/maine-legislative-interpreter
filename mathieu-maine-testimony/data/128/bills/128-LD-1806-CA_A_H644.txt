'I:'he required local activities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant !o the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill establishes surcharges on hybrid and battery-electric motor vehicles. It includes a one-time Highway Fund 
allocation of $54, 790 in fiscal year 2018-19 to the Department of Secretary of State for computer programming costs 
and modifications to vendor systems to implement the surcharges. Highway Fund revenues would increase by 
$1,000,000 beginning in fiscal year 2019-20 based on 19,000 hybrid motor vehicles at $50 and 400 battery-electric 
motor vehicles at $125.
