Page 1 - 128LR2775(01)-11 Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as  emergencies; and
3 Whereas, the practice of using local telephone numbers to mask a caller's 
4 out-of-state  location in order to disguise fraudulent activity  is increasing; and
5 Whereas, the  victims of  this practice are often Maine's elderly; and
6 Whereas, this legislation is intended to restrict  this practice by prohibiting the rental  
7 or sale of  local numbers to persons  that have no physical presence in the State;  and
8 Whereas, in the judgment  of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine  and require  the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety;  now, 
11 therefore,
12 Be it enacted  by the People of  the State of Maine as  follows:
13 Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง7110 is  enacted to read:
14 ยง7110.  Prohibition  on selling or renting  inaccurate  caller ID information
15 A voice service provider may not rent or sell telephone numbers with a North 
16 American Numbering Plan area code assigned  to Maine to a person unless that person has 
17 a sufficient physical presence  in the State.
18 The commission shall  adopt rules to define  "sufficient physical  presence"  and to 
19 implement this section.   Rules  adopted pursuant to this section are routine  technical rules 
20 as defined  in Title 5, chapter  375, subchapter  2-A.
21 Emergency clause.  In view  of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
22 legislation takes effect when  approved.
23 SUMMARY
