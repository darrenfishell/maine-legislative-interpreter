SUMMARY  11 
This bill removes duplicative language regarding samples provided to the public by 12 
manufacturers licensed t o produce wine, malt liquor and spirits in the State.  The bill 13 
consolidates into one paragraph the provisions that govern the sale of a manufacturer's 14 
product for off -premises consumption to nonlicensees from the licensed manufacturer's 15 
facility.  It also  repeals and replaces in a separate subsection the provisions governing the 16 
authorization of a licensed manufacturer in the State to have a retail establishment 17 
licensed for the sale of liquor to be consumed on the premises, issued in accordance with 18 
the M aine Revised Statutes, Title 28 -A, chapter 43.  19
