Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 1A1 (l/-Z.Jl.) 
Committee: Environment and Natural Resources 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill would prohibit hydraulic fracturing and the transportation of hydraulic fracturing by-products, wastewater 
and waste products in the State. The Department of Enviromnental Protection has indicated that current statutes 
regarding well injection, discharge of pollutants and groundwater protection regulations would all have the cumulative 
effect of preventing the granting of a permit to perfom1 hydraulic fractwfog activities in the State. Any additional 
costs to the department to coordinate the enforcement of the currently existing statutes with regard to hydraulic 
fracturing are anticipated to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
