CONFERENCE AMENDMENT  B.  Subject to paragraph A, an employer's contribution rate for the 12 -month period 1 
commencing Ja nuary 1st of each year is based upon the employer's experience rating 2 
record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio.  The employer's reserve 3 
ratio is the percent obtained by dividing the amount, if any, by which the employer's 4 
contributions, cred ited from the time the employer first or most recently became an 5 
employer, whichever date is later, up to and including June 30th of the preceding 6 
year, including any part of the employer's contributions due for that year paid on or 7 
before July 31st of tha t year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same 8 
period, by the employer's average annual payroll for the period of 36 consecutive 9 
months ending June 30th of the preceding year.  The employer's contribution rate is 10 
determined under subparagra phs (1) to (8).  11 
 (1)  The commissioner shall prepare a schedule listing all employers for whom a 12 
reserve ratio has been computed pursuant to this paragraph, in the order of their 13 
reserve ratios, beginning with the highest ratio.  For each employer, the sch edule 14 
must show:  15 
(a)  The amount of the employer's reserve ratio;  16 
(b)  The amount of the employer's annual taxable payroll; and  17 
(c)  A cumulative total consisting of the amount of the employer's annual 18 
taxable payroll plus the amount of the annual taxable payrolls of all other 19 
employers preceding the employer on the list.  20 
(2)  The commissioner shall segregate employers into contribution categories in 21 
accordance with the cumulative totals under subparagraph (1), division (c).  The 22 
contribution category is de termined by the cumulative payroll percentage limits 23 
in column B.  Each contribution category is identified by the contribution 24 
category number in column A that is opposite the figures in column B, which 25 
represent the percentage limits of each contribution  category.  If an employer's 26 
taxable payroll falls in more than one contribution category, the employer must 27 
be assigned to the lower -numbered contribution category, except that an 28 
employer may not be assigned to a higher contribution category than is assi gned 29 
any other employer with the same reserve ratio.  30

(3-A)  Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner shall compute a reserve 14 
multipl e to determine the schedule and planned yield in effect for a rate year. The 15 
reserve multiple is determined by dividing the fund reserve ratio by the average 16 
benefit cost rate. The determination date is October 31st of each calendar year.  17 
The schedule and  planned yield that apply for the 12 -month period commencing 18 
on January 1, 2008 and every January 1st thereafter are shown on the line of the 19 
following table that corresponds with the applicable reserve multiple in column 20

ratio of total wages to taxable wages for the preceding calendar year by the 34 
planned yield.  35

year by multiplying the predetermined yield by the experience fa ctors for each 37 
contribution category.  Contribution category 20 in the table in subparagraph (2) 38 
must be assigned a contribution rate of at least 5.4%.  The employer's experience 39 
factor is the percentage shown in column C in the table in subparagraph (2) t hat 40

is in effect as determined in subparagraph (3 -A), the experience factor in 2 
subparagraph (2) for contribution category 1 is assigned an experience factor of 3 
0.00 in column C.  4 
(6)  If, subsequen t to the assignment of contribution rates for a rate year, the 5 
reserve ratio of an employer is recomputed and changed, the employer must be 6 
placed in the position on the schedule prepared pursuant to subparagraph (1) that 7 
the employer would have occupied h ad the corrected reserve ratio been shown on 8

(7)  In computing the contribution rates, only the wages reported by employers 11 
liable for payment of contri butions into the fund and net benefits paid that are 12 
charged to an employer's experience rating record or to the fund are considered in 13 
the computation of the average benefit cost rate and the ratio of total wages to 14 
taxable wages.  15 
(8)  Beginning January 1 , 2008, all contribution rates must be reduced by the 16 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund predetermined yield as defined in section 17
