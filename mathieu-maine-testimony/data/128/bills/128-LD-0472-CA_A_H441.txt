128TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 335, L.D. 472, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Parental Rights" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 19-A MRSA ยง1651, as amended by PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. C, ยง17 and 
affected by Pt. D, ยง 1, is repealed and the following enacted in its place: 
ยง1651. Rights of parents 
1. Parents joint natural guardians of children. The parents are the joint natural 
guardians of their minor children and are jointly entitled to the care, custody, control, 
services and earnings of their children. Neither parent has any rights paramount to the 
rights of the other with reference to any matter affecting their children. 
2. Fundamental liberty interest. A parent has a fundamental liberty interest in 
directing the care, custody and control of the parent's child. 
3. Government interference. The State or any political subdivision of the State 
may not infringe the liberty interest in subsection 2 unless that infringement is justified by 
a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling state interest 
through the least restrictive means necessary.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, strikes the po1tion of 
the bill requiring a court to order shared parental rights and responsibilities in a divorce or 
parental rights and responsibilities proceeding unless it finds a compelling state interest to 
justify an alternative arrangement. The amendment instead provides that the State or a 
political subdivision of the State may not infringe a parent's fundamental right to direct 
the care, custody and control of the parent's child unless the infringement is justified by a 
compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling state interest 
through the least restrictive means necessary.
