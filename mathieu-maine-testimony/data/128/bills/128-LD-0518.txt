 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA ยง4313, sub -ยง2, as amended by PL 2007, c. 411, ยง1, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Burial or cremation.   In the event of the death of an eligible person, the funeral 4 
director sha ll notify the overseer prior to burial or cremation or by the end of 3 business 5 
days following the funeral director's receipt of the body, whichever is earlier. 6 
Notwithstanding section 4305, subsection 3, paragraph C, a decision on any application 7 
for assi stance with burial expenses need not be rendered until the overseer has verified 8 
that no a relative or other resource is not available to pay for the direct burial or 9 
cremation costs, but the decision must be rendered within 8 days after receiving an 10 
appli cation.  The father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, children or grandchildren, by 11 
consanguinity, living within or owning real or tangible property within the State,  or the 12 
spouse or domestic partner  are responsible for the burial or cremation costs of t he eligible 13 
person in proportion to their respective abilities.  When no legally liable relative 14 
possesses a financial capacity to pay either in lump sum or on an installment basis for the 15 
direct costs of a burial or cremation, the contribution of a munici pality under this 16 
subsection is limited to a reasonable calculation of the funeral director's direct costs, less 17 
any and all contributions from any other source.  For the purposes of this subsection, 18 
"domestic partner" has the same meaning as in section 27 10, subsection 2.  19 
SUMMARY  20 
This bill adds spouses and domestic partners to the list of relatives who are 21 
potentially responsible for the burial or cremation costs of a person who was eligible to 22 
receive municipal general assistance at the time of that perso n's death.  The bill also 23 
strikes the provision of law that restricts potentially responsible relatives to persons who 24 
live or own property in Maine.  25
